not
le
closely
related
to
our
people
's
prosperity
and
well-being
is
the
removal
of
restriction
upon
the
importation
of
the
raw
material
necessary
to
our
manufacture
.
the
world
should
be
open
to
our
national
ingenuity
and
enterprise
.
this
can
not
be
while
federal
legislation
through
the
imposition
of
high
tariff
forbids
to
american
manufacturer
a
cheap
material
a
those
used
by
their
competitor
.
it
is
quite
obvious
that
the
.enhancement
of
the
price
of
our
manufactured
product
resulting
from
this
policy
not
only
confines
the
market
for
these
product
within
our
own
border
,
to
the
direct
disadvantage
of
our
manufacturer
,
but
also
increase
their
cost
to
our
citizen
.
