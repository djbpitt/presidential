our
soldier
and
sailor
and
marine
know
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
will
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
vote
,
if
the
voting
machinery
is
left
exclusively
to
the
state
under
existing
state
lawsâ€”and
that
there
is
no
likelihood
of
these
law
being
changed
in
time
to
enable
them
to
vote
at
the
next
election
.
the
army
and
navy
have
reported
that
it
will
be
impossible
effectively
to
administer
forty-eight
different
soldier
voting
law
.
it
is
the
duty
of
the
congress
to
remove
this
unjustifiable
discrimination
against
the
men
and
woman
in
our
armed
forces-
and
to
do
it
a
quickly
a
possible
.
