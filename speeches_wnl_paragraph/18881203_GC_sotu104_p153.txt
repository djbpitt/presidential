of
the
total
number
of
postmaster
54,874
are
of
the
fourth
class
.
these
,
of
course
,
receive
no
allowance
whatever
for
expense
in
the
service
,
and
their
compensation
is
fixed
by
percentage
on
receipt
at
their
respective
office
.
this
rate
of
compensation
may
have
been
,
and
probably
wa
,
at
some
time
just
,
but
the
standard
ha
remained
unchanged
through
the
several
reduction
in
the
rate
of
postage
.
such
reduction
have
necessarily
cut
down
the
compensation
of
these
official
,
while
it
undoubtedly
increased
the
business
performed
by
them
.
simple
justice
requires
attention
to
this
subject
,
to
the
end
that
fourth-class
postmaster
may
receive
at
least
an
equivalent
to
that
which
the
law
itself
,
fixing
the
rate
,
intended
for
them
.
