america
will
remain
the
anchor
of
strong
alliance
in
every
corner
of
the
globe
.
and
we
will
renew
those
institution
that
extend
our
capacity
to
manage
crisis
abroad
,
for
no
one
ha
a
greater
stake
in
a
peaceful
world
than
it
most
powerful
nation
.
we
will
support
democracy
from
asia
to
africa
,
from
the
america
to
the
middle
east
,
because
our
interest
and
our
conscience
compel
u
to
act
on
behalf
of
those
who
long
for
freedom
.
and
we
must
be
a
source
of
hope
to
the
poor
,
the
sick
,
the
marginalized
,
the
victim
of
prejudiceâ€”not
out
of
mere
charity
,
but
because
peace
in
our
time
requires
the
constant
advance
of
those
principle
that
our
common
creed
describes
:
tolerance
and
opportunity
,
human
dignity
and
justice
.
