in
concluding
this
communication
it
last
word
shall
be
an
appeal
to
the
congress
for
the
most
rigid
economy
in
the
expenditure
of
the
money
it
hold
in
trust
for
the
people
.
the
way
to
perplexing
extravagance
is
easy
,
but
a
return
to
frugality
is
difficult
.
when
,
however
,
it
is
considered
that
those
who
bear
the
burden
of
taxation
have
no
guaranty
of
honest
care
save
in
the
fidelity
of
their
public
servant
,
the
duty
of
all
possible
retrenchment
is
plainly
manifest
.
