this
is
the
meaning
of
our
liberty
and
our
creedâ€”why
men
and
woman
and
child
of
every
race
and
every
faith
can
join
in
celebration
across
this
magnificent
mall
,
and
why
a
man
whose
father
le
than
sixty
year
ago
might
not
have
been
served
at
a
local
restaurant
can
now
stand
before
you
to
take
a
most
sacred
oath
.
