add
to
all
this
the
difference
in
the
administration
of
the
agency
.
while
the
same
duty
are
devolved
upon
all
,
the
disposition
of
the
agent
and
the
manner
of
their
contact
with
the
indian
have
much
to
do
with
their
condition
and
welfare
.
the
agent
who
perfunctorily
performs
his
duty
and
slothfully
neglect
all
opportunity
to
advance
their
moral
and
physical
improvement
and
fails
to
inspire
them
with
a
desire
for
better
thing
will
accomplish
nothing
in
the
direction
of
their
civilization
,
while
he
who
feel
the
burden
of
an
important
trust
and
ha
an
interest
in
his
work
will
,
by
consistent
example
,
firm
yet
considerate
treatment
,
and
well-directed
aid
and
encouragement
,
constantly
lead
those
under
his
charge
toward
the
light
of
their
enfranchisement
.
