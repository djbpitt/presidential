it
is
not
for
the
``
common
benefit
of
the
united
state
''
that
a
large
area
of
the
public
land
should
be
acquired
,
directly
or
through
fraud
,
in
the
hand
of
a
single
individual
.
the
nation
's
strength
is
in
the
people
.
the
nation
's
prosperity
is
in
their
prosperity
.
the
nation
's
glory
is
in
the
equality
of
her
justice
.
the
nation's
perpetuity
is
in
the
patriotism
of
all
her
people
.
hence
,
a
far
a
practicable
,
the
plan
adopted
in
the
disposal
of
the
public
land
should
have
in
view
the
original
policy
,
which
encouraged
many
purchase
of
these
land
for
home
and
discouraged
the
massing
of
large
area
.
exclusive
of
alaska
,
about
three-fifths
of
the
national
domain
ha
been
sold
or
subjected
to
contract
or
grant
.
of
the
remaining
two-fifths
a
considerable
portion
is
either
mountain
or
desert
.
a
rapidly
increasing
population
creates
a
growing
demand
for
home
,
and
the
accumulation
of
wealth
inspires
an
eager
competition
to
obtain
the
public
land
for
speculative
purpose
.
in
the
future
this
collision
of
interest
will
be
more
marked
than
in
the
past
,
and
the
execution
of
the
nation
's
trust
in
behalf
of
our
settler
will
be
more
difficult
.
i
therefore
commend
to
your
attention
the
recommendation
contained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
with
reference
to
the
repeal
and
modification
of
certain
of
our
land
law
.
