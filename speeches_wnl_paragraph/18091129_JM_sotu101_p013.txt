whatever
may
be
the
course
of
your
deliberation
on
the
subject
of
our
military
establishment
,
i
should
fail
in
my
duty
in
not
recommending
to
your
serious
attention
the
importance
of
giving
to
our
militia
,
the
great
bulwark
of
our
security
and
resource
of
our
power
,
an
organization
best
adapted
to
eventual
situation
for
which
the
united
state
ought
to
be
prepared
.
