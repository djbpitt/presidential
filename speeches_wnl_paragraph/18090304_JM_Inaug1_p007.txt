but
the
source
to
which
i
look
or
the
aid
which
alone
can
supply
my
deficiency
is
in
the
well-tried
intelligence
and
virtue
of
my
fellow-citizens
,
and
in
the
counsel
of
those
representing
them
in
the
other
department
associated
in
the
care
of
the
national
interest
.
in
these
my
confidence
will
under
every
difficulty
be
best
placed
,
next
to
that
which
we
have
all
been
encouraged
to
feel
in
the
guardianship
and
guidance
of
that
almighty
being
whose
power
regulates
the
destiny
of
nation
,
whose
blessing
have
been
so
conspicuously
dispensed
to
this
rising
republic
,
and
to
whom
we
are
bound
to
address
our
devout
gratitude
for
the
past
,
a
well
a
our
fervent
supplication
and
best
hope
for
the
future
.
