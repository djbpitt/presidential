for
a
much
a
government
can
do
and
must
do
,
it
is
ultimately
the
faith
and
determination
of
the
american
people
upon
which
this
nation
relies
.
it
is
the
kindness
to
take
in
a
stranger
when
the
levee
break
,
the
selflessness
of
worker
who
would
rather
cut
their
hour
than
see
a
friend
lose
their
job
which
see
u
through
our
darkest
hour
.
it
is
the
firefighter
's
courage
to
storm
a
stairway
filled
with
smoke
,
but
also
a
parent
's
willingness
to
nurture
a
child
,
that
finally
decides
our
fate
.
