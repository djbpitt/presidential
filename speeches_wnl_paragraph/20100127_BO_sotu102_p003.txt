it
's
tempting
to
look
back
on
these
moment
and
assume
that
our
progress
wa
inevitable
,
that
america
wa
always
destined
to
succeed
.
but
when
the
union
wa
turned
back
at
bull
run
and
the
ally
first
landed
at
omaha
beach
,
victory
wa
very
much
in
doubt
.
when
the
market
crashed
on
black
tuesday
and
civil
right
marcher
were
beaten
on
bloody
sunday
,
the
future
wa
anything
but
certain
.
these
were
the
time
that
tested
the
courage
of
our
conviction
and
the
strength
of
our
union
.
and
despite
all
our
division
and
disagreement
,
our
hesitation
and
our
fear
,
america
prevailed
because
we
chose
to
move
forward
a
one
nation
,
a
one
people
.
again
,
we
are
tested
.
and
again
,
we
must
answer
history
's
call
.
