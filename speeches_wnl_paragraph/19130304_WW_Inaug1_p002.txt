it
mean
much
more
than
the
mere
success
of
a
party
.
the
success
ofa
party
mean
little
except
when
the
nation
is
using
that
party
for
a
largeand
definite
purpose
.
no
one
can
mistake
the
purpose
for
which
the
nationnow
seek
to
use
the
democratic
party
.
it
seek
to
use
it
to
interpreta
change
in
it
own
plan
and
point
of
view
.
some
old
thing
with
whichwe
had
grown
familiar
,
and
which
had
begun
to
creep
into
the
very
habitof
our
thought
and
of
our
life
,
have
altered
their
aspect
a
we
have
latterlylooked
critically
upon
them
,
with
fresh
,
awakened
eye
;
have
dropped
theirdisguises
and
shown
themselves
alien
and
sinister
.
some
new
thing
,
aswe
look
frankly
upon
them
,
willing
to
comprehend
their
real
character
,
have
come
to
assume
the
aspect
of
thing
long
believed
in
and
familiar
,
stuff
of
our
own
conviction
.
we
have
been
refreshed
by
a
new
insight
intoour
own
life
.
