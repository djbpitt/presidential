so
tonight
i
'm
proposing
that
we
take
$
30
billion
of
the
money
wall
street
bank
have
repaid
and
use
it
to
help
community
bank
give
small
business
the
credit
they
need
to
stay
afloat
.
i
'm
also
proposing
a
new
small
business
tax
credit
,
one
that
will
go
to
over
1
million
small
business
who
hire
new
worker
or
raise
wage
.
while
we
're
at
it
,
let
's
also
eliminate
all
capital
gain
tax
on
small-business
investment
and
provide
a
tax
incentive
for
all
large
business
and
all
small
business
to
invest
in
new
plant
and
equipment
.
