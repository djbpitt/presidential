those
who
are
doing
most
of
the
complaining
are
not
deliberately
striving
to
sabotage
the
national
war
effort
.
they
are
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
time
is
past
when
we
must
make
prodigious
sacrifices-
that
the
war
is
already
won
and
we
can
begin
to
slacken
off
.
but
the
dangerous
folly
of
that
point
of
view
can
be
measured
by
the
distance
that
separate
our
troop
from
their
ultimate
objective
in
berlin
and
tokyoâ€”and
by
the
sum
of
all
the
peril
that
lie
along
the
way
.
