the
united
state
,
having
been
the
first
to
abolish
within
the
extent
of
their
authority
the
transportation
of
the
native
of
africa
into
slavery
,
by
prohibiting
the
introduction
of
slave
and
by
punishing
their
citizen
participating
in
the
traffic
,
can
not
but
be
gratified
at
the
progress
made
by
concurrent
effort
of
other
nation
toward
a
general
suppression
of
so
great
an
evil
.
they
must
feel
at
the
same
time
the
greater
solicitude
to
give
the
fullest
efficacy
to
their
own
regulation
.
with
that
view
,
the
interposition
of
congress
appears
to
be
required
by
the
violation
and
evasion
which
it
is
suggested
are
chargeable
on
unworthy
citizen
who
mingle
in
the
slave
trade
under
foreign
flag
and
with
foreign
port
,
and
by
collusive
importation
of
slave
into
the
united
state
through
adjoining
port
and
territory
.
i
present
the
subject
to
congress
with
a
full
assurance
of
their
disposition
to
apply
all
the
remedy
which
can
be
afforded
by
an
amendment
of
the
law
.
the
regulation
which
were
intended
to
guard
against
abuse
of
a
kindred
character
in
the
trade
between
the
several
state
ought
also
to
be
rendered
more
effectual
for
their
humane
object
.
