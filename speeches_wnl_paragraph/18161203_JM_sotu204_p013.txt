a
a
subject
of
the
highest
importance
to
the
national
welfare
,
i
must
again
earnestly
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
a
reorganization
of
the
militia
on
a
plan
which
will
form
it
into
class
according
to
the
period
of
life
more
or
le
adapted
to
military
service
.
an
efficient
militia
is
authorized
and
contemplated
by
the
constitution
and
required
by
the
spirit
and
safety
of
free
government
.
the
present
organization
of
our
militia
is
universally
regarded
a
le
efficient
than
it
ought
to
be
made
,
and
no
organization
can
be
better
calculated
to
give
to
it
it
due
force
than
a
classification
which
will
assign
the
foremost
place
in
the
defense
of
the
country
to
that
portion
of
it
citizen
whose
activity
and
animation
best
enable
them
to
rally
to
it
standard
.
besides
the
consideration
that
a
time
of
peace
is
the
time
when
the
change
can
be
made
with
most
convenience
and
equity
,
it
will
now
be
aided
by
the
experience
of
a
recent
war
in
which
the
militia
bore
so
interesting
a
part
.
