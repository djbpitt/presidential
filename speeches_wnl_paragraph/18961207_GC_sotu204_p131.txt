under
the
present
management
of
the
department
it
usefulness
ha
been
enhanced
in
every
direction
,
and
at
the
same
time
strict
economy
ha
been
enforced
to
the
utmost
extent
permitted
by
congressional
action
.
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
it
appears
that
through
careful
and
prudent
financial
management
he
ha
annually
saved
a
large
sum
from
his
appropriation
,
aggregating
during
his
incumbency
and
up
to
the
close
of
the
present
fiscal
year
nearly
one-fifth
of
the
entire
amount
appropriated
.
these
result
have
been
accomplished
by
a
conscientious
study
of
the
real
need
of
the
farmer
and
such
a
regard
for
economy
a
the
genuine
farmer
ought
to
appreciate
,
supplemented
by
a
rigid
adherence
to
civil-service
method
in
a
department
which
should
be
conducted
in
the
interest
of
agriculture
instead
of
partisan
politics
.
