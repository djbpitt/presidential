by
diffusing
through
the
mass
of
the
nation
the
element
of
military
discipline
and

by
augmenting
and
distributing
warlike
preparation
applicable
to
future
use
;
by
evincing
the
zeal
and
valor
with
which
they
will
be
employed
and
the
cheerfulness
with
which
every
necessary
burden
will
be
borne
,
a
greater
respect
for
our
right
and
a
longer
duration
of
our
future
peace
are
promised
than
could
be
expected
without
these
