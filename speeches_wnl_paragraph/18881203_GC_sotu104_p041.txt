the
ambition
which
lead
me
on
is
an
anxious
desire
and
a
fixed
determination
to
restore
to
the
people
unimpaired
the
sacred
trust
they
have
confided
to
my
charge
;
to
,
heal
the
wound
of
the
constitution
and
to
preserve
it
from
further
violation
;
to
persuade
my
countryman
,
so
far
a
i
may
,
that
it
is
not
in
a
splendid
government
supported
by
powerful
monopoly
and
aristocratical
establishment
that
they
will
find
happiness
or
their
liberty
protection
,
but
in
a
plain
system
,
void
of
pomp
,
protecting
all
and
granting
favor
to
none
,
dispensing
it
blessing
like
the
dew
of
heaven
,
unseen
and
unfelt
save
in
the
freshness
and
beauty
they
contribute
to
produce
.
it
is
such
a
government
that
the
genius
of
our
people
requires
--
such
an
one
only
under
which
our
state
may
remain
for
age
to
come
united
,
prosperous
,
and
free
.
