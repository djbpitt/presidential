while
none
of
our
citizen
in
turkey
have
thus
far
been
killed
or
wounded
,
though
often
in
the
midst
of
dreadful
scene
of
danger
,
their
safety
in
the
future
is
by
no
mean
assured
.
our
government
at
home
and
our
minister
at
constantinople
have
left
nothing
undone
to
protect
our
missionary
in
ottoman
territory
,
who
constitute
nearly
all
the
individual
residing
there
who
have
a
right
to
claim
our
protection
on
the
score
of
american
citizenship
.
our
effort
in
this
direction
will
not
be
relaxed
;
but
the
deep
feeling
and
sympathy
that
have
been
aroused
among
our
people
ought
not
to
so
far
blind
their
reason
and
judgment
a
to
lead
them
to
demand
impossible
thing
.
the
outbreak
of
the
blind
fury
which
lead
to
murder
and
pillage
in
turkey
occur
suddenly
and
without
notice
,
and
an
attempt
on
our
part
to
force
such
a
hostile
presence
there
a
might
be
effective
for
prevention
or
protection
would
not
only
be
resisted
by
the
ottoman
government
,
but
would
be
regarded
a
an
interruption
of
their
plan
by
the
great
nation
who
assert
their
exclusive
right
to
intervene
in
their
own
time
and
method
for
the
security
of
life
and
property
in
turkey
.
