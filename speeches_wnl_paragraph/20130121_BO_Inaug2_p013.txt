for
we
,
the
people
,
understand
that
our
country
can
not
succeed
when
a
shrinking
few
do
very
well
and
a
growing
many
barely
make
it
.
we
believe
that
america
's
prosperity
must
rest
upon
the
broad
shoulder
of
a
rising
middle
class
.
we
know
that
america
thrives
when
every
person
can
find
independence
and
pride
in
their
work
;
when
the
wage
of
honest
labor
liberate
family
from
the
brink
of
hardship
.
we
are
true
to
our
creed
when
a
little
girl
born
into
the
bleakest
poverty
know
that
she
ha
the
same
chance
to
succeed
a
anybody
else
,
because
she
is
an
american
;
she
is
free
and
she
is
equal
,
not
just
in
the
eye
of
god
,
but
also
in
our
own
.
