we
know
our
economy
is
stronger
when
we
reward
an
honest
day
's
work
with
honest
wage
.
but
today
,
a
full-time
worker
making
the
minimum
wage
earns
$
14,500
a
year
.
even
with
the
tax
relief
we
put
in
place
,
a
family
with
two
kid
that
earns
the
minimum
wage
still
life
below
the
poverty
line
.
that
's
wrong
.
that
's
why
,
since
the
last
time
this
congress
raised
the
minimum
wage
,
19
state
have
chosen
to
bump
theirs
even
higher
.
