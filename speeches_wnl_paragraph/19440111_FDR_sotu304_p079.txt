i
ask
the
congress
to
explore
the
mean
for
implementing
this
economic
bill
of
rights-
for
it
is
definitely
the
responsibility
of
the
congress
so
to
do
.
many
of
these
problem
are
already
before
committee
of
the
congress
in
the
form
of
proposed
legislation
.
i
shall
from
time
to
time
communicate
with
the
congress
with
respect
to
these
and
further
proposal
.
in
the
event
that
no
adequate
program
of
progress
is
evolved
,
i
am
certain
that
the
nation
will
be
conscious
of
the
fact
.
