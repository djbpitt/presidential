there
are
two
way
in
which
the
united
state
can
assist
to
accomplish
this
great
object
.
first
,
by
offering
the
example
within
her
own
border
of
the
will
and
power
of
democracy
to
make
and
enforce
law
which
are
unquestionably
just
and
which
are
equal
in
their
administration-laws
which
secure
it
full
right
to
labor
and
yet
at
the
same
time
safeguard
the
integrity
of
property
,
and
particularly
of
that
property
which
is
devoted
to
the
development
of
industry
and
the
increase
of
the
necessary
wealth
of
the
world
.
second
,
by
standing
for
right
and
justice
a
toward
individual
nation
.
the
law
of
democracy
is
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
,
and
the
influence
of
every
democracy
in
the
world
should
be
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
nation
,
the
nation
which
is
struggling
toward
it
right
and
toward
it
proper
recognition
and
privilege
in
the
family
of
nation
.
