nearly
all
of
u
recognize
that
a
intricacy
of
human
relationship
increase
,
so
power
to
govern
them
also
must
increase
power
to
stop
evil
;
power
to
do
good
.
the
essential
democracy
of
our
nation
and
the
safety
of
our
people
depend
not
upon
the
absence
of
power
,
but
upon
lodging
it
with
those
whom
the
people
can
change
or
continue
at
stated
interval
through
an
honest
and
free
system
of
election
.
the
constitution
of
1787
did
not
make
our
democracy
impotent
.
