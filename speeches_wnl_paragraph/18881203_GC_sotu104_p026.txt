it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
selfish
and
private
interest
which
are
so
persistently
heard
when
effort
are
made
to
deal
in
a
just
and
comprehensive
manner
with
our
tariff
law
are
related
to
,
if
they
are
not
responsible
for
,
the
sentiment
largely
prevailing
among
the
people
that
the
general
government
is
the
fountain
of
individual
and
private
aid
;
that
it
may
be
expected
to
relieve
with
paternal
care
the
distress
of
citizen
and
community
,
and
that
from
the
fullness
of
it
treasury
it
should
,
upon
the
slightest
possible
pretext
of
promoting
the
general
good
,
apply
public
fund
to
the
benefit
of
locality
and
individual
.
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
there
is
a
growing
assumption
that
,
a
against
the
government
and
in
favor
of
private
claim
and
interest
,
the
usual
rule
and
limitation
of
business
principle
and
just
dealing
should
be
waived
.
