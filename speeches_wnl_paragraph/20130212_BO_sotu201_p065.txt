today
,
the
organization
that
attacked
u
on
9/11
is
a
shadow
of
it
former
self
.
it's
true
,
different
al
qaida
affiliate
and
extremist
group
have
emerged
,
from
the
arabian
peninsula
to
africa
.
the
threat
these
group
pose
is
evolving
.
but
to
meet
this
threat
,
we
do
n't
need
to
send
ten
of
thousand
of
our
son
and
daughter
abroad
or
occupy
other
nation
.
instead
,
we
'll
need
to
help
country
like
yemen
and
libya
and
somalia
provide
for
their
own
security
and
help
ally
who
take
the
fight
to
terrorist
,
a
we
have
in
mali
.
and
where
necessary
,
through
a
range
of
capability
,
we
will
continue
to
take
direct
action
against
those
terrorist
who
pose
the
gravest
threat
to
american
.
