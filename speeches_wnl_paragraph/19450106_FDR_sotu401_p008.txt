the
high
tide
of
this
german
effort
wa
reached
two
day
after
christmas
.
since
then
we
have
reassumed
the
offensive
,
rescued
the
isolated
garrison
at
bastogne
,
and
forced
a
german
withdrawal
along
the
whole
line
of
the
salient
.
the
speed
with
which
we
recovered
from
this
savage
attack
wa
largely
possible
because
we
have
one
supreme
commander
in
complete
control
of
all
the
allied
army
in
france
.
general
eisenhower
ha
faced
this
period
of
trial
with
admirable
calm
and
resolution
and
with
steadily
increasing
success
.
he
ha
my
complete
confidence
.
