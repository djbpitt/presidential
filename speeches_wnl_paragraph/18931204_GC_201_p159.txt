the
continued
intelligent
execution
of
the
civil-service
law
and
the
increasing
approval
by
the
people
of
it
operation
are
most
gratifying
.
the
recent
extension
of
it
limitation
and
regulation
to
the
employee
at
free-delivery
post-offices
,
which
ha
been
honestly
and
promptly
accomplished
by
the
commission
,
with
the
hearty
cooperation
of
the
postmaster-general
,
is
an
immensely
important
advance
in
the
usefulness
of
the
system
.
