occurrence
having
taken
place
which
shew
that
the
statutory
provision
for
the
dispensation
of
criminal
justice
are
deficient
in
relation
both
to
place
and
to
person
under
the
exclusive
cognizance
of
the
national
authority
,
an
amendment
of
the
law
embracing
such
case
will
merit
the
earliest
attention
of
the
legislature
.
it
will
be
a
seasonable
occasion
also
for
inquiring
how
far
legislative
interposition
may
be
further
requisite
in
providing
penalty
for
offense
designated
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
statute
,
and
to
which
either
no
penalty
are
annexed
or
none
with
sufficient
certainty
.
and
i
submit
to
the
wisdom
of
congress
whether
a
more
enlarged
revisal
of
the
criminal
code
be
not
expedient
for
the
purpose
of
mitigating
in
certain
case
penalty
which
were
adopted
into
it
antecedent
to
experiment
and
example
which
justify
and
recommend
a
more
lenient
policy
.
