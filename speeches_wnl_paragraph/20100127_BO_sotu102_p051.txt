so
,
a
temperature
cool
,
i
want
everyone
to
take
another
look
at
the
plan
we've
proposed
.
there
's
a
reason
why
many
doctor
,
nurse
,
and
health
care
expert
who
know
our
system
best
consider
this
approach
a
vast
improvement
over
the
status
quo
.
but
if
anyone
from
either
party
ha
a
better
approach
that
will
bring
down
premium
,
bring
down
the
deficit
,
cover
the
uninsured
,
strengthen
medicare
for
senior
,
and
stop
insurance
company
abuse
,
let
me
know
.
let
me
know
.
let
me
know
.
i
'm
eager
to
see
it
.
