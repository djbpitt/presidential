recall
that
earlier
generation
faced
down
fascism
and
communism
not
just
with
missile
and
tank
,
but
with
sturdy
alliance
and
enduring
conviction
.
they
understood
that
our
power
alone
can
not
protect
u
,
nor
doe
it
entitle
u
to
do
a
we
please
.
instead
,
they
knew
that
our
power
grows
through
it
prudent
use
;
our
security
emanates
from
the
justness
of
our
cause
,
the
force
of
our
example
,
the
tempering
quality
of
humility
and
restraint
.
