that
is
why
today
i
offer
no
promise
of
a
purely
governmental
solution
for
every
problem
.
we
have
lived
too
long
with
that
false
promise
.
in
trusting
too
much
in
government
,
we
have
asked
of
it
more
than
it
can
deliver
.
this
lead
only
to
inflated
expectation
,
to
reduced
individual
effort
,
and
to
a
disappointment
and
frustration
that
erode
confidence
both
in
what
government
can
do
and
in
hat
people
can
do
.
