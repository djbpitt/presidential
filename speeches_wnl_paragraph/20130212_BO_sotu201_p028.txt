today
,
no
area
hold
more
promise
than
our
investment
in
american
energy
.
after
year
of
talking
about
it
,
we
're
finally
poised
to
control
our
own
energy
future
.
we
produce
more
oil
at
home
than
we
have
in
15
year
.
we
have
doubled
the
distance
our
car
will
go
on
a
gallon
of
gas
and
the
amount
of
renewable
energy
we
generate
from
source
like
wind
and
solar
,
with
ten
of
thousand
of
good
american
job
to
show
for
it
.
we
produce
more
natural
gas
than
ever
before
,
and
nearly
everyone
's
energy
bill
is
lower
because
of
it
.
and
over
the
last
4
year
,
our
emission
of
the
dangerous
carbon
pollution
that
threatens
our
planet
have
actually
fallen
.
