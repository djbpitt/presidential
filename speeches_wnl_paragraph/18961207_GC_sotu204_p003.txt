when
we
consider
these
incident
and
contemplate
the
peaceful
obedience
and
manly
submission
which
have
succeeded
a
heated
clash
of
political
opinion
,
we
discover
abundant
evidence
of
a
determination
on
the
part
of
our
countryman
to
abide
by
every
verdict
of
the
popular
will
and
to
be
controlled
at
all
time
by
an
abiding
faith
in
the
agency
established
for
the
direction
of
the
affair
of
their
government
.
