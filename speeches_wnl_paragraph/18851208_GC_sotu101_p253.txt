people
may
well
trust
the

execute

but
of
course
no
relaxation
of
the

no

experience
in

to
hope
that

to
the
system

a

doubt
may
well
be
entertained
whether
our
government
could
survive
the
strain
of
a
continuance
of
this
system
,
which
upon
every
change
of
administration
inspires
an
immense
army
of
claimant
for
office
to
lay
siege
to
the
patronage
of
government
,
engrossing
the
time
of
public
officer
with
their
importunity
,
spreading
abroad
the
contagion

their
disappointment

and
filling
the

discontent
