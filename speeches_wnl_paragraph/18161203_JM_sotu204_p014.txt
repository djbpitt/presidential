congress
will
call
to
mind
that
no
adequate
provision
ha
yet
been
made
for
the
uniformity
of
weight
and
measure
also
contemplated
by
the
constitution
.
the
great
utility
of
a
standard
fixed
in
it
nature
and
founded
on
the
easy
rule
of
decimal
proportion
is
sufficiently
obvious
.
it
led
the
government
at
an
early
stage
to
preparatory
step
for
introducing
it
,
and
a
completion
of
the
work
will
be
a
just
title
to
the
public
gratitude
.
