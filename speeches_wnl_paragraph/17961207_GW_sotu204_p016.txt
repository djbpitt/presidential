sort
,
commensurate
only
with
the
call
of
the
public
service
in

peace
,
will
in
time
of
war
easily
be
extended
in
proportion
to
the
exigency
of
the
government
,
and
may
even
perhaps
be
made
to
yield
a
surplus

the

of
our
citizen
at

,
so
a
to
mitigate
the
privation
from
the
interruption
of
their

the

ought
to
exclude
all
those

which
are
already

or
likely
soon
to
be

established
in
the

,
in

interference
with
pursuit
of
