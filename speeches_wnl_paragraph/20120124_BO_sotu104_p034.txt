teacher
matter
.
so
instead
of
bashing
them
or
defending
the
status
quo
,
let
's
offer
school
a
deal
.
give
them
the
resource
to
keep
good
teacher
on
the
job
and
reward
the
best
one
.
and
in
return
,
grant
school
flexibility
to
teach
with
creativity
and
passion
,
to
stop
teaching
to
the
test
,
and
to
replace
teacher
who
just
are
n't
helping
kid
learn
.
that
's
a
bargain
worth
making
.
