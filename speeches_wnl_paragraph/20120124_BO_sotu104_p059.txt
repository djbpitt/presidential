there
's
never
been
a
better
time
to
build
,
especially
since
the
construction
industry
wa
one
of
the
hardest
hit
when
the
housing
bubble
burst
.
of
course
,
construction
worker
were
n't
the
only
one
who
were
hurt
.
so
were
million
of
innocent
american
who
've
seen
their
home
value
decline
.
and
while
government
ca
n't
fix
the
problem
on
it
own
,
responsible
homeowner
should
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
for
the
housing
market
to
hit
bottom
to
get
some
relief
.
