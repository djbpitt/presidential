the
defining
issue
of
our
time
is
how
to
keep
that
promise
alive
.
no
challenge
is
more
urgent
.
no
debate
is
more
important
.
we
can
either
settle
for
a
country
where
a
shrinking
number
of
people
do
really
well
while
a
growing
number
of
american
barely
get
by
.
or
we
can
restore
an
economy
where
everyone
get
a
fair
shot
and
everyone
doe
their
fair
share
and
everyone
play
by
the
same
set
of
rule
.
what
's
at
stake
aren't
democratic
value
or
republican
value
,
but
american
value
.
and
we
have
to
reclaim
them
.
