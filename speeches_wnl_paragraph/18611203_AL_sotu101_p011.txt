i
deem
it
of
importance
that
the
loyal
region
of
east
tennessee
and
western
north
carolina
should
be
connected
with
kentucky
and
other
faithful
part
of
the
union
by
railroad
.
i
therefore
recommend
,
a
a
military
measure
,
that
congress
provide
for
the
construction
of
such
road
a
speedily
a
possible
.
kentucky
no
doubt
will
cooperate
,
and
through
her
legislature
make
the
most
judicious
selection
of
a
line
.
the
northern
terminus
must
connect
with
some
existing
railroad
,
and
whether
the
route
shall
be
from
lexington
or
nicholasville
to
the
cumberland
gap
,
or
from
lebanon
to
the
tennessee
line
,
in
the
direction
of
knoxville
,
or
on
some
still
different
line
,
can
easily
be
determined
.
kentucky
and
the
general
government
cooperating
,
the
work
can
be
completed
in
a
very
short
time
,
and
when
done
it
will
be
not
only
of
vast
present
usefulness
,
but
also
a
valuable
permanent
improvement
,
worth
it
cost
in
all
the
future
.
