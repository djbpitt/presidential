since
your
last
adjournment
lieutenant-general
scott
ha
retired
from
the
head
of
the
army
.
during
his
long
life
the
nation
ha
not
been
unmindful
of
his
merit
;
yet
on
calling
to
mind
how
faithfully
,
ably
,
and
brilliantly
he
ha
served
the
country
,
from
a
time
far
back
in
our
history
,
when
few
of
the
now
living
had
been
born
,
and
thenceforward
continually
,
i
can
not
but
think
we
are
still
his
debtor
.
i
submit
,
therefore
,
for
your
consideration
what
further
mark
of
recognition
is
due
to
him
,
and
to
ourselves
a
a
grateful
people
.
