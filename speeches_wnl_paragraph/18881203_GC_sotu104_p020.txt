when
to
the
selfishness
of
the
beneficiary
of
unjust
discrimination
under
our
law
there
shall
be
added
the
discontent
of
those
who
suffer
from
such
discrimination
,
we
will
realize
the
fact
that
the
beneficent
purpose
of
our
government
,
dependent
upon
the
patriotism
and
contentment
of
our
people
,
are
endangered
.
