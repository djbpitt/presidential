today
we
continue
a
never-ending
journey
to
bridge
the
meaning
of
those
word
with
the
reality
of
our
time
.
for
history
tell
u
that
while
these
truth
may
be
self-evident
,
they
've
never
been
self-executing
;
that
while
freedom
is
a
gift
from
god
,
it
must
be
secured
by
his
people
here
on
earth
.
the
patriot
of
1776
did
not
fight
to
replace
the
tyranny
of
a
king
with
the
privilege
of
a
few
or
the
rule
of
a
mob
.
they
gave
to
u
a
republic
,
a
government
of
and
by
and
for
the
people
,
entrusting
each
generation
to
keep
safe
our
founding
creed
.
