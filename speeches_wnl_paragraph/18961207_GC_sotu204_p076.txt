an
effective
cooperation
between
the
auditor
's
office
and
the
post-office
department
and
the
making
and
enforcement
of
order
by
the
department
requiring
immediate
notification
to
their
surety
of
all
delinquency
on
the
part
of
postmaster
,
and
compelling
such
postmaster
to
make
more
frequent
deposit
of
postal
fund
,
have
resulted
in
a
prompter
auditing
of
their
account
and
much
le
default
to
the
