in
the
interest
of
good
neighborhood
and
of
the
commercial
intercourse
of
adjacent
community
,
the
question
of
the
north
american
fishery
is
one
of
much
importance
.
following
out
the
intimation
given
by
me
when
the
extensory
arrangement
above
described
wa
negotiated
,
i
recommend
that
the
congress
provide
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
in
which
the
government
of
the
united
state
and
great
britain
shall
be
respectively
represented
,
charged
with
the
consideration
and
settlement
,
upon
a
just
,
equitable
,
and
honorable
basis
,
of
the
entire
question
of
the
fishing
right
of
the
two
government
and
their
respective
citizen
on
the
coast
of
the
united
state
and
british
north
america
.
the
fishing
interest
being
intimately
related
to
other
general
question
dependent
upon
contiguity
and
intercourse
,
consideration
thereof
in
all
their
equity
might
also
properly
come
within
the
purview
of
such
a
commission
,
and
the
fullest
latitude
of
expression
on
both
side
should
be
permitted
.
