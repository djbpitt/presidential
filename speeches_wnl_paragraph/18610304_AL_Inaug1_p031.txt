physically
speaking
,
we
can
not
separate
.
we
can
not
remove
our
respective
section
from
each
other
,
nor
build
an
impassable
wall
between
them
.
a
husband
and
wife
may
be
divorced
,
and
go
out
of
the
presence
and
beyond
the
reach
of
each
other
;
but
the
different
part
of
our
country
can
not
do
this
.
they
can
not
but
remain
face
to
face
,
and
intercourse
,
either
amicable
or
hostile
,
must
continue
between
them
.
is
it
possible
,
then
,
to
make
that
intercourse
more
advantageous
or
more
satisfactory
after
separation
than
before
?
can
alien
make
treaty
easier
than
friend
can
make
law
?
can
treaty
be
more
faithfully
enforced
between
alien
than
law
can
among
friend
?
suppose
you
go
to
war
,
you
can
not
fight
always
;
and
when
,
after
much
loss
on
both
side
,
and
no
gain
on
either
,
you
cease
fighting
,
the
identical
old
question
a
to
term
of
intercourse
are
again
upon
you
.
