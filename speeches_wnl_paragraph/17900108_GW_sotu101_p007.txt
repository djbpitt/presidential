there
wa
reason
to
hope
that
the
pacific
measure
adopted
with
regard
to
certain
hostile
tribe
of
indian
would
have
relieved
the
inhabitant
of
our
southern
and
western
frontier
from
their
depredation
,
but
you
will
perceive
from
the
information
contained
in
the
paper
which
i
shall
direct
to
be
laid
before
you
(
comprehending
a
communication
from
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
)
that
we
ought
to
be
prepared
to
afford
protection
to
those
part
of
the
union
,
and
,
if
necessary
,
to
punish
aggressor
.
