during
the
past
year
there
ha
been
a
growing
belief
that
there
is
little
fault
to
be
found
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
a
it
stand
today
.
the
vital
need
is
not
an
alteration
of
our
fundamental
law
,
but
an
increasingly
enlightened
view
with
reference
to
it
.
difficulty
have
grown
out
of
it
interpretation
;
but
rightly
considered
,
it
can
be
used
a
an
instrument
of
progress
,
and
not
a
a
device
for
prevention
of
action
.
