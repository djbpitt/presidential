i
solicit
your
authority
to
furnish
to
the
republic
a
gunboat
at
moderate
cost
,
to
be
reimbursed
to
the
united
state
by
installment
.
such
a
vessel
is
needed
for
the
safety
of
that
state
against
the
native
african
race
,
and
in
liberian
hand
it
would
be
more
effective
in
arresting
the
african
slave
trade
than
a
squadron
in
our
own
hand
.
the
possession
of
the
least
organized
naval
force
would
stimulate
a
generous
ambition
in
the
republic
,
and
the
confidence
which
we
should
manifest
by
furnishing
it
would
win
forbearance
and
favor
toward
the
colony
from
all
civilized
nation
.
