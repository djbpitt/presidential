the
agricultural
interest
of
the
country
demand
just
recognition
and
liberal
encouragement
.
it
sustains
with
certainty
and
unfailing
strength
our
nation
's
prosperity
by
the
product
of
it
steady
toil
,
and
bear
it
full
share
of
the
burden
of
taxation
without
complaint
.
our
agriculturist
have
but
slight
personal
representation
in
the
council
of
the
nation
,
and
are
generally
content
with
the
humbler
duty
of
citizenship
and
willing
to
trust
to
the
bounty
of
nature
for
a
reward
of
their
labor
.
but
the
magnitude
and
value
of
this
industry
are
appreciated
when
the
statement
is
made
that
of
our
total
annual
export
more
than
three-fourths
are
the
product
of
agriculture
,
and
of
our
total
population
nearly
one-half
are
exclusively
engaged
in
that
occupation
.
