i
can
not
dismiss
the
subject
of
indian
affair
without
again
recommending
to
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
more
adequate
provision
for
giving
energy
to
the
law
throughout
our
interior
frontier
and
for
restraining
the
commission
of
outrage
upon
the
indian
,
without
which
all
pacific
plan
must
prove
nugatory
.
to
enable
,
by
competent
reward
,
the
employment
of
qualified
and
trusty
person
to
reside
among
them
a
agent
would
also
contribute
to
the
preservation
of
peace
and
good
neighborhood
.
if
in
addition
to
these
expedient
an
eligible
plan
could
be
devised
for
promoting
civilization
among
the
friendly
tribe
and
for
carrying
on
trade
with
them
upon
a
scale
equal
to
their
want
and
under
regulation
calculated
to
protect
them
from
imposition
and
extortion
,
it
influence
in
cementing
their
interest
with
ours
could
not
but
be
considerable
.
