on
the
day
i
took
office
,
our
auto
industry
wa
on
the
verge
of
collapse
.
some
even
said
we
should
let
it
die
.
with
a
million
job
at
stake
,
i
refused
to
let
that
happen
.
in
exchange
for
help
,
we
demanded
responsibility
.
we
got
worker
and
automaker
to
settle
their
difference
.
we
got
the
industry
to
retool
and
restructure
.
today
,
general
motor
is
back
on
top
a
the
world
's
number-one
automaker
.
chrysler
ha
grown
faster
in
the
u.s.
than
any
major
car
company
.
ford
is
investing
billion
in
u.s.
plant
and
factory
.
and
together
,
the
entire
industry
added
nearly
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
job
.
