the
inability
to
get
the
needed
nurse
for
the
army
is
not
due
to
any
shortage
of
nurse
;
280,000
registered
nurse
are
now
practicing
in
this
country
.
it
ha
been
estimated
by
the
war
manpower
commission
that
27,000
additional
nurse
could
be
made
available
to
the
armed
force
without
interfering
too
seriously
with
the
need
of
the
civilian
population
for
nurse
.
