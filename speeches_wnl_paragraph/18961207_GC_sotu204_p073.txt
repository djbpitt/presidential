it
appears
that
since
the
transfer
of
the
fort
leavenworth
military
prison
to
it
new
us
the
work
previously
done
by
prisoner
confined
there
,
and
for
which
expensive
machinery
ha
been
provided
,
ha
been
discontinued
.
this
work
consisted
of
the
manufacture
of
article
for
army
use
,
now
done
elsewhere
.
on
all
ground
it
is
exceedingly
desirable
that
the
convict
confined
in
this
penitentiary
be
allowed
to
resume
work
of
this
description
.
