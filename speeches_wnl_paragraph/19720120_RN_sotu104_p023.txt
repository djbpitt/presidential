a
we
look
to
the
future
,
we
find
encouraging
progress
in
our
negotiation
with
the
soviet
union
on
limitation
of
strategic
arm
.
and
looking
further
into
the
future
,
we
hope
there
can
eventually
be
agreement
on
the
mutual
reduction
of
arm
.
but
until
there
is
such
a
mutual
agreement
,
we
must
maintain
the
strength
necessary
to
deter
war
.
