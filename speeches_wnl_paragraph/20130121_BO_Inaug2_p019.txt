we
,
the
people
,
still
believe
that
enduring
security
and
lasting
peace
do
not
require
perpetual
war
.
our
brave
men
and
woman
in
uniform
,
tempered
by
the
flame
of
battle
,
are
unmatched
in
skill
and
courage
.
our
citizen
,
seared
by
the
memory
of
those
we
have
lost
,
know
too
well
the
price
that
is
paid
for
liberty
.
the
knowledge
of
their
sacrifice
will
keep
u
forever
vigilant
against
those
who
would
do
u
harm
.
but
we
are
also
heir
to
those
who
won
the
peace
and
not
just
the
war
;
who
turned
sworn
enemy
into
the
surest
of
friendsâ€”and
we
must
carry
those
lesson
into
this
time
a
well
.
