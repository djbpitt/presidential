recovery
from
the
disturbing
and
sometimes
disastrous
effect
of
the
late
war
ha
been
exceedingly
slow
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
,
and
ha
given
promise
,
i
venture-to
say
,
of
early
completion
only
in
our
own
fortunate
country
;
but
even
with
u
the
recovery
halt
and
is
impeded
at
time
,
and
there
are
immediately
serviceable
act
of
legislation
which
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
attempt
,
to
assist
that
recovery
and
prove
the
indestructible
recuperative
force
of
a
great
government
of
the
people
.
one
of
these
is
to
prove
that
a
great
democracy
can
keep
house
a
successfully
and
in
a
business-like
a
fashion
a
any
other
government
.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
step
toward
providing
this
is
to
supply
ourselves
with
a
systematic
method
of
handling
our
estimate
and
expenditure
and
bringing
them
to
the
point
where
they
will
not
be
an
unnecessary
strain
upon
our
income
or
necessitate
unreasonable
taxation
;
in
other
word
,
a
workable
budget
system
.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
two
element
are
essential
to
such
a
system-namely
,
not
only
that
the
proposal
of
appropriation
should
be
in
the
hand
of
a
single
body
,
such
a
a
single
appropriation
committee
in
each
house
of
the
congress
,
but
also
that
this
body
should
be
brought
into
such
cooperation
with
the
department
of
the
government
and
with
the
treasury
of
the
united
state
a
would
enable
it
to
act
upon
a
complete
conspectus
of
the
need
of
the
government
and
the
resource
from
which
it
must
draw
it
income
.
