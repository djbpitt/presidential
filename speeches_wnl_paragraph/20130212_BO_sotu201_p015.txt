but
we
ca
n't
ask
senior
citizen
and
working
family
to
shoulder
the
entire
burden
of
deficit
reduction
while
asking
nothing
more
from
the
wealthiest
and
the
most
powerful
.
we
wo
n't
grow
the
middle
class
simply
by
shifting
the
cost
of
health
care
or
college
onto
family
that
are
already
struggling
or
by
forcing
community
to
lay
off
more
teacher
and
more
cop
and
more
firefighter
.
most
americans—democrats
,
republican
,
and
independents—understand
that
we
ca
n't
just
cut
our
way
to
prosperity
.
they
know
that
broad-based
economic
growth
requires
a
balanced
approach
to
deficit
reduction
,
with
spending
cut
and
revenue
and
with
everybody
doing
their
fair
share
.
and
that
's
the
approach
i
offer
tonight
.
