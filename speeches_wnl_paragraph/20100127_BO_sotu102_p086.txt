unfortunately
,
too
many
of
our
citizen
have
lost
faith
that
our
biggest
institutions—our
corporation
,
our
medium
,
and
,
yes
,
our
government—still
reflect
these
same
value
.
each
of
these
institution
are
full
of
honorable
men
and
woman
doing
important
work
that
help
our
country
prosper
.
but
each
time
a
ceo
reward
himself
for
failure
or
a
banker
put
the
rest
of
u
at
risk
for
his
own
selfish
gain
,
people
's
doubt
grow
.
each
time
lobbyist
game
the
system
or
politician
tear
each
other
down
instead
of
lifting
this
country
up
,
we
lose
faith
.
the
more
that
tv
pundit
reduce
serious
debate
to
silly
argument
,
big
issue
into
sound
bite
,
our
citizen
turn
away
.
no
wonder
there
's
so
much
cynicism
out
there
.
no
wonder
there
's
so
much
disappointment
.
