it
is
scarcely
questioned
that
this
provision
wa
intended
by
those
who
made
it
for
the
reclaiming
of
what
we
call
fugitive
slave
;
and
the
intention
of
the
lawgiver
is
the
law
.
all
member
of
congress
swear
their
support
to
the
whole
constitutionâ€”to
this
provision
a
much
a
to
any
other
.
to
the
proposition
,
then
,
that
slave
whose
case
come
within
the
term
of
this
clause
``
shall
be
delivered
up
,
''
their
oath
are
unanimous
.
now
,
if
they
would
make
the
effort
in
good
temper
,
could
they
not
with
nearly
equal
unanimity
frame
and
pas
a
law
by
mean
of
which
to
keep
good
that
unanimous
oath
?
