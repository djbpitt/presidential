to
democrat
,
i
would
remind
you
that
we
still
have
the
largest
majority
in
decade
and
the
people
expect
u
to
solve
problem
,
not
run
for
the
hill
.
and
if
the
republican
leadership
is
going
to
insist
that
60
vote
in
the
senate
are
required
to
do
any
business
at
all
in
this
town—a
supermajority—then
the
responsibility
to
govern
is
now
yours
a
well
.
just
saying
no
to
everything
may
be
good
short-term
politics
,
but
it's
not
leadership
.
we
were
sent
here
to
serve
our
citizen
,
not
our
ambition
.
so
let's
show
the
american
people
that
we
can
do
it
together
.
