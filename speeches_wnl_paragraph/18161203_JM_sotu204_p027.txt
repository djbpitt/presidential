happily
,
i
shall
carry
with
me
from
the
public
theater
other
source
,
which
those
who
love
their
country
most
will
best
appreciate
.
i
shall
behold
it
blessed
with
tranquillity
and
prosperity
at
home
and
with
peace
and
respect
abroad
.
i
can
indulge
the
proud
reflection
that
the
american
people
have
reached
in
safety
and
success
their
40th
year
a
an
independent
nation
;
that
for
nearly
an
entire
generation
they
have
had
experience
of
their
present
constitution
,
the
off-spring
of
their
undisturbed
deliberation
and
of
their
free
choice
;
that
they
have
found
it
to
bear
the
trial
of
adverse
a
well
a
prosperous
circumstance
;
to
contain
in
it
combination
of
the
federate
and
elective
principle
a
reconcilement
of
public
strength
with
individual
liberty
,
of
national
power
for
the
defense
of
national
right
with
a
security
against
war
of
injustice
,
of
ambition
,
and
vain-glory
in
the
fundamental
provision
which
subject
all
question
of
war
to
the
will
of
the
nation
itself
,
which
is
to
pay
it
cost
and
feel
it
calamity
.
nor
is
it
le
a
peculiar
felicity
of
this
constitution
,
so
dear
to
u
all
,
that
it
is
found
to
be
capable
,
without
losing
it
vital
energy
,
of
expanding
itself
over
a
spacious
territory
with
the
increase
and
expansion
of
the
community
for
whose
benefit
it
wa
established
.
