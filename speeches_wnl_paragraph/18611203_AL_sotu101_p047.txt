the
present
insurrection
show
,
i
think
,
that
the
extension
of
this
district
across
the
potomac
river
at
the
time
of
establishing
the
capital
here
wa
eminently
wise
,
and
consequently
that
the
relinquishment
of
that
portion
of
it
which
lie
within
the
state
of
virginia
wa
unwise
and
dangerous
.
i
submit
for
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
regaining
that
part
of
the
district
and
the
restoration
of
the
original
boundary
thereof
through
negotiation
with
the
state
of
virginia
.
