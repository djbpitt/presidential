we
,
the
people
,
still
believe
that
every
citizen
deserves
a
basic
measure
of
security
and
dignity
.
we
must
make
the
hard
choice
to
reduce
the
cost
of
health
care
and
the
size
of
our
deficit
.
but
we
reject
the
belief
that
america
must
choose
between
caring
for
the
generation
that
built
this
country
and
investing
in
the
generation
that
will
build
it
future
.
for
we
remember
the
lesson
of
our
past
,
when
twilight
year
were
spent
in
poverty
and
parent
of
a
child
with
a
disability
had
nowhere
to
turn
.
