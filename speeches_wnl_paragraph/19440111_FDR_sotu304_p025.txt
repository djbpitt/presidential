if
we
analyze
american
history
impartially
,
we
can
not
escape
the
fact
that
in
our
past
we
have
not
always
forgotten
individual
and
selfish
and
partisan
interest
in
time
of
warâ€”we
have
not
always
been
united
in
purpose
and
direction
.
we
can
not
overlook
the
serious
dissension
and
the
lack
of
unity
in
our
war
of
the
revolution
,
in
our
war
of
1812
,
or
in
our
war
between
the
state
,
when
the
survival
of
the
union
itself
wa
at
stake
.
