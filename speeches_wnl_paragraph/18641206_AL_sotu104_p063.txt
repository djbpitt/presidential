the
national
resource
,
then
,
are
unexhausted
,
and
,
a
we
believe
,
inexhaustible
.
the
public
purpose
to
reestablish
and
maintain
the
national
authority
is
unchanged
,
and
,
a
we
believe
,
unchangeable
.
the
manner
of
continuing
the
effort
remains
to
choose
.
on
careful
consideration
of
all
the
evidence
accessible
it
seems
to
me
that
no
attempt
at
negotiation
with
the
insurgent
leader
could
result
in
any
good
.
he
would
accept
nothing
short
of
severance
of
the
union
,
precisely
what
we
will
not
and
can
not
give
.
his
declaration
to
this
effect
are
explicit
and
oft
repeated
.
he
doe
not
attempt
to
deceive
u
.
he
affords
u
no
excuse
to
deceive
ourselves
.
he
can
not
voluntarily
reaccept
the
union
;
we
can
not
voluntarily
yield
it
.
between
him
and
u
the
issue
is
distinct
,
simple
,
and
inflexible
.
it
is
an
issue
which
can
only
be
tried
by
war
and
decided
by
victory
.
if
we
yield
,
we
are
beaten
;
if
the
southern
people
fail
him
,
he
is
beaten
.
either
way
it
would
be
the
victory
and
defeat
following
war
.
what
is
true
,
however
,
of
him
who
head
the
insurgent
cause
is
not
necessarily
true
of
those
who
follow
.
although
he
can
not
reaccept
the
union
,
they
can
.
some
of
them
,
we
know
,
already
desire
peace
and
reunion
.
the
number
of
such
may
increase
.
they
can
at
any
moment
have
peace
simply
by
laying
down
their
arm
and
submitting
to
the
national
authority
under
the
constitution
.
alter
so
much
the
government
could
not
,
if
it
would
,
maintain
war
against
them
.
the
loyal
people
would
not
sustain
or
allow
it
.
if
question
should
remain
,
we
would
adjust
them
by
the
peaceful
mean
of
legislation
,
conference
,
court
,
and
vote
,
operating
only
in
constitutional
and
lawful
channel
.
some
certain
,
and
other
possible
,
question
are
and
would
be
beyond
the
executive
power
to
adjust
;
a
,
for
instance
,
the
admission
of
member
into
congress
and
whatever
might
require
the
appropriation
of
money
.
the
executive
power
itself
would
be
greatly
diminished
by
the
cessation
of
actual
war
.
pardon
and
remission
of
forfeiture
,
however
,
would
still
be
within
executive
control
.
in
what
spirit
and
temper
this
control
would
be
exercised
can
be
fairly
judged
of
by
the
past
.
