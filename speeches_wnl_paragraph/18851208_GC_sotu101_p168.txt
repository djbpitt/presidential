the
acting
judge-advocate-general
report
that
the
number
of
trial
by
general
courts-martial
during
the
year
wa
2,328
,
and
that
11,851
trial
took
place
before
garrison
and
regimental
courts-martial
.
the
suggestion
that
probably
more
than
half
the
army
have
been
tried
for
offense
,
great
and
small
,
in
one
year
may
well
arrest
attention
.
of
course
many
of
these
trial
before
garrison
and
regimental
courts-martial
were
for
offense
almost
frivolous
,
and
there
should
,
i
think
,
be
a
way
devised
to
dispose
of
these
in
a
more
summary
and
le
inconvenient
manner
than
by
court-martial
.
