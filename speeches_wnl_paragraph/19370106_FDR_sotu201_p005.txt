it
wa
not
only
that
the
visible
mechanism
of
economic
life
had
broken
down
.
more
disturbing
wa
the
fact
that
long
neglect
of
the
need
of
the
underprivileged
had
brought
too
many
of
our
people
to
the
verge
of
doubt
a
to
the
successful
adaptation
of
our
historic
tradition
to
the
complex
modern
world
.
in
that
lay
a
challenge
to
our
democratic
form
of
government
itself
.
