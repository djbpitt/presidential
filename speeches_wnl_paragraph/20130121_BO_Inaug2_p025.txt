decision
are
upon
u
and
we
can
not
afford
delay
.
we
can
not
mistake
absolutism
for
principle
or
substitute
spectacle
for
politics
or
treat
name-calling
a
reasoned
debate
.
we
must
act
,
knowing
that
our
work
will
be
imperfect
.
we
must
act
,
we
must
act
knowing
that
today
's
victory
will
be
only
partial
and
that
it
will
be
up
to
those
who
stand
here
in
4

and
40
year
and
400
year
hence
to
advance
the
timeless
spirit
