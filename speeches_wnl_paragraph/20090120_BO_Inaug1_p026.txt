a
we
consider
the
road
that
unfolds
before
u
,
we
remember
with
humble
gratitude
those
brave
american
who
,
at
this
very
hour
,
patrol
far-off
desert
and
distant
mountain
.
they
have
something
to
tell
u
today
,
just
a
the
fallen
hero
who
lie
in
arlington
whisper
through
the
age
.
we
honor
them
not
only
because
they
are
guardian
of
our
liberty
,
but
because
they
embody
the
spirit
of
service
;
a
willingness
to
find
meaning
in
something
greater
than
themselves
.
and
yet
,
at
this
moment—a
moment
that
will
define
a
generation—it
is
precisely
this
spirit
that
must
inhabit
u
all
.
