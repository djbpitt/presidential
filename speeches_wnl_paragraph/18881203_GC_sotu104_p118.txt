at
first
sight
this
would
seem
to
be
a
profitable
and
sensible
transaction
on
the
part
of
the
government
,
but
,
a
suggested
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
,
the
surplus
thus
expended
for
the
purchase
of
bond
wa
money
drawn
from
the
people
in
excess
of
any
actual
need
of
the
government
and
wa
so
expended
rather
than
allow
it
to
remain
idle
in
the
treasury
.
if
this
surplus
,
under
the
operation
of
just
and
equitable
law
,
had
been
left
in
the
hand
of
the
people
,
it
would
have
been
worth
in
their
business
at
least
6
per
cent
per
annum
.
deducting
from
the
amount
of
interest
upon
the
principal
and
premium
of
these
bond
for
the
time
they
had
to
run
at
the
rate
of
6
per
cent
the
saving
of
2
per
cent
made
for
the
people
by
the
purchase
of
such
bond
,
the
loss
will
appear
to
be
$
55,760,000
.
