therefore
,
a
your
president
,
performing
my
constitutional
duty
to
``
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
,
''
i
find
it
,
unhappily
,
necessary
to
report
that
the
future
and
the
safety
of
our
country
and
of
our
democracy
are
overwhelmingly
involved
in
event
far
beyond
our
border
