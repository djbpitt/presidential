with
the
retirement
of
general
scott
came
the
executive
duty
of
appointing
in
his
stead
a
general
in
chief
of
the
army
.
it
is
a
fortunate
circumstance
that
neither
in
council
nor
country
wa
there
,
so
far
a
i
know
,
any
difference
of
opinion
a
to
the
proper
person
to
be
selected
.
the
retiring
chief
repeatedly
expressed
his
judgment
in
favor
of
general
mcclellan
for
the
position
,
and
in
this
the
nation
seemed
to
give
a
unanimous
concurrence
.
the
designation
of
general
mcclellan
is
therefore
in
considerable
degree
the
selection
of
the
country
a
well
a
of
the
executive
,
and
hence
there
is
better
reason
to
hope
there
will
be
given
him
the
confidence
and
cordial
support
thus
by
fair
implication
promised
,
and
without
which
he
can
not
with
so
full
efficiency
serve
the
country
.
