the
abundant
natural
resource
of
these
territory
,
with
the
security
and
protection
afforded
by
organized
government
,
will
doubtless
invite
to
them
a
large
immigration
when
peace
shall
restore
the
business
of
the
country
to
it
accustomed
channel
.
i
submit
the
resolution
of
the
legislature
of
colorado
,
which
evidence
the
patriotic
spirit
of
the
people
of
the
territory
.
so
far
the
authority
of
the
united
state
ha
been
upheld
in
all
the
territory
,
a
it
is
hoped
it
will
be
in
the
future
.
i
commend
their
interest
and
defense
to
the
enlightened
and
generous
care
of
congress
.
