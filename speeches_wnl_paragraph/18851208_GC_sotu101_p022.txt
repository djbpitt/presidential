whatever
highway
may
be
constructed
across
the
barrier
dividing
the
two
greatest
maritime
area
of
the
world
must
be
for
the
world
's
benefit
--
a
trust
for
mankind
,
to
be
removed
from
the
chance
of
domination
by
any
single
power
,
nor
become
a
point
of
invitation
for
hostility
or
a
prize
for
warlike
ambition
.
an
engagement
combining
the
construction
,
ownership
,
and
operation
of
such
a
work
by
this
government
,
with
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
for
it
protection
,
with
the
foreign
state
whose
responsibility
and
right
we
would
share
is
,
in
my
judgment
,
inconsistent
with
such
dedication
to
universal
and
neutral
use
,
and
would
,
moreover
,
entail
measure
for
it
realization
beyond
the
scope
of
our
national
polity
or
present
mean
.
