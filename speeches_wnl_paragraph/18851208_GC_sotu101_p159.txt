so
far
a
a
further
survey
of
our
coast
is
concerned
,
there
seems
to
be
a
propriety
in
transferring
that
work
to
the
navy
department
.
the
other
duty
now
in
charge
of
this
establishment
,
if
they
can
not
be
profitably
attached
to
some
existing
department
or
other
bureau
,
should
be
prosecuted
under
a
law
exactly
defining
their
scope
and
purpose
,
and
with
a
careful
discrimination
between
the
scientific
inquiry
which
may
properly
be
assumed
by
the
government
and
those
which
should
be
undertaken
by
state
authority
or
by
individual
enterprise
.
