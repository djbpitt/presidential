we
should
always
keep
in
mind
that
of
all
form
of
military
preparation
coast
defense
alone
is
essentially
pacific
in
it
nature
.
while
it
give
the
sense
of
security
due
to
a
consciousness
of
strength
,
it
is
neither
the
purpose
nor
the
effect
of
such
permanent
fortification
to
involve
u
in
foreign
complication
,
but
rather
to
guarantee
u
against
them
.
they
are
not
temptation
to
war
,
but
security
against
it
.
thus
they
are
thoroughly
in
accord
with
all
the
tradition
of
our
national
diplomacy
.
