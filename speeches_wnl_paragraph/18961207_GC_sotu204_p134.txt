in
my
opinion
the
gratuitous
distribution
of
seed
by
the
department
a
at
present
conducted
ought
to
be
discontinued
.
no
one
can
read
the
statement
of
the
secretary
on
this
subject
and
doubt
the
extravagance
and
questionable
result
of
this
practice
.
the
professed
friend
of
the
farmer
,
and
certainly
the
farmer
themselves
,
are
naturally
expected
to
be
willing
to
rid
a
department
devoted
to
the
promotion
of
farming
interest
of
a
feature
which
tends
so
much
to
it
discredit
.
