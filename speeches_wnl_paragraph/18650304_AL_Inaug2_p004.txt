one-eighth
of
the
whole
population
were
colored
slave
,
not
distributed
generally
over
the
union
.
but
localized
in
the
southern
part
of
it
.
these
slave
constituted
a
peculiar
and
powerful
interest
.
all
knew
that
this
interest
wa
somehow
the
cause
of
the
war
.
to
strengthen
,
perpetuate
,
and
extend
this
interest
wa
the
object
for
which
the
insurgent
would
rend
the
union
even
by
war
,
while
the
government
claimed
no
right
to
do
more
than
to
restrict
the
territorial
enlargement
of
it
.
neither
party
expected
for
the
war
the
magnitude
or
the
duration
which
it
ha
already
attained
.
neither
anticipated
that
the
cause
of
the
conflict
might
cease
with
or
even
before
the
conflict
itself
should
cease
.
each
looked
for
an
easier
triumph
,
and
a
result
le
fundamental
and
astounding
.
both
read
the
same
bible
and
pray
to
the
same
god
,
and
each
invokes
his
aid
against
the
other
.
it
may
seem
strange
that
any
men
should
dare
to
ask
a
just
god
's
assistance
in
wringing
their
bread
from
the
sweat
of
other
men
's
face
,
but
let
u
judge
not
,
that
we
be
not
judged
.
the
prayer
of
both
could
not
be
answered
.
that
of
neither
ha
been
answered
fully
.
the
almighty
ha
his
own
purpose
.
``
woe
unto
the
world
because
of
offense
;
for
it
must
need
be
that
offense
come
,
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offense
cometh
.
''
if
we
shall
suppose
that
american
slavery
is
one
of
those
offense
which
,
in
the
providence
of
god
,
must
need
come
,
but
which
,
having
continued
through
his
appointed
time
,
he
now
will
to
remove
,
and
that
he
give
to
both
north
and
south
this
terrible
war
a
the
woe
due
to
those
by
whom
the
offense
came
,
shall
we
discern
therein
any
departure
from
those
divine
attribute
which
the
believer
in
a
living
god
always
ascribe
to
him
?
fondly
do
we
hope
,
fervently
do
we
pray
,
that
this
mighty
scourge
of
war
may
speedily
pas
away
.
yet
,
if
god
will
that
it
continue
until
all
the
wealth
piled
by
the
bondsman
's
two
hundred
and
fifty
year
of
unrequited
toil
shall
be
sunk
,
and
until
every
drop
of
blood
drawn
with
the
lash
shall
be
paid
by
another
drawn
with
the
sword
,
a
wa
said
three
thousand
year
ago
,
so
still
it
must
be
said
``
the
judgment
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether
.
