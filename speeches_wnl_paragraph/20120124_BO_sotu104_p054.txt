we
can
also
spur
energy
innovation
with
new
incentive
.
the
difference
in
this
chamber
may
be
too
deep
right
now
to
pas
a
comprehensive
plan
to
fight
climate
change
.
but
there
's
no
reason
why
congress
should
n't
at
least
set
a
clean
energy
standard
that
creates
a
market
for
innovation
.
so
far
,
you
have
n't
acted
.
well
,
tonight
i
will
.
i'm
directing
my
administration
to
allow
the
development
of
clean
energy
on
enough
public
land
to
power
3
million
home
.
and
i
'm
proud
to
announce
that
the
department
of
defense
,
working
with
u
,
the
world
's
largest
consumer
of
energy
,
will
make
one
of
the
largest
commitment
to
clean
energy
in
history
,
with
the
navy
purchasing
enough
capacity
to
power
a
quarter
of
a
million
home
a
year
.
