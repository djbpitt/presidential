the
organization
and
admission
of
the
state
of
nevada
ha
been
completed
in
conformity
with
law
,
and
thus
our
excellent
system
is
firmly
established
in
the
mountain
,
which
once
seemed
a
barren
and
uninhabitable
waste
between
the
atlantic
state
and
those
which
have
grown
up
on
the
coast
of
the
pacific
ocean
.
