at
the
outset
of
a
reference
to
the
more
important
matter
affecting
our
relation
with
foreign
power
it
would
afford
me
satisfaction
if
i
could
assure
the
congress
that
the
disturbed
condition
in
asiatic
turkey
had
during
the
past
year
assumed
a
le
hideous
and
bloody
aspect
and
that
,
either
a
a
consequence
of
the
awakening
of
the
turkish
government
to
the
demand
of
humane
civilization
or
a
the
result
of
decisive
action
on
the
part
of
the
great
nation
having
the
right
by
treaty
to
interfere
for
the
protection
of
those
exposed
to
the
rage
of
mad
bigotry
and
cruel
fanaticism
,
the
shocking
feature
of
the
situation
had
been
mitigated
.
instead
,
however
,
of
welcoming
a
softened
disposition
or
protective
intervention
,
we
have
been
afflicted
by
continued
and
not
unfrequent
report
of
the
wanton
destruction
of
home
and
the
bloody
butchery
of
men
,
woman
,
and
child
,
made
martyr
to
their
profession
of
christian
faith
.
