i
realize
that
tax
reform
and
entitlement
reform
will
not
be
easy
.
the
politics
will
be
hard
for
both
side
.
none
of
u
will
get
a
hundred
percent
of
what
we
want
.
but
the
alternative
will
cost
u
job
,
hurt
our
economy
,
visit
hardship
on
million
of
hard-working
american
.
so
let
's
set
party
interest
aside
and
work
to
pas
a
budget
that
replaces
reckless
cut
with
smart
saving
and
wise
investment
in
our
future
.
and
let
's
do
it
without
the
brinksmanship
that
stress
consumer
and
scare
off
investor
.
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
can
not
keep
conducting
it
business
by
drifting
from
one
manufactured
crisis
to
the
next
.
we
ca
n't
do
it
.
