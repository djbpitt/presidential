why
should
there
not
be
a
patient
confidence
in
the
ultimate
justice
of
the
people
?
is
there
any
better
or
equal
hope
in
the
world
?
in
our
present
difference
is
either
party
without
faith
of
being
in
the
right
?
if
the
almighty
ruler
of
nation
,
with
his
eternal
truth
and
justice
,
be
on
your
side
of
the
north
,
or
on
yours
of
the
south
,
that
truth
and
that
justice
will
surely
prevail
by
the
judgment
of
this
great
tribunal
of
the
american
people
.
