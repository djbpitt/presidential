it
wa
hoped
that
the
treaty
of
holston
,
made
with
the
cherokee
nation
in
july
,
1791
,
would
have
prevented
a
repetition
of
such
depredation
;
but
the
event
ha
not
answered
this
hope
.
the
chickamauga
,
aided
by
some
bandit
of
another
tribe
in
their
vicinity
,
have
recently
perpetrated
wanton
and
unprovoked
hostility
upon
the
citizen
of
the
united
state
in
that
quarter
.
the
information
which
ha
been
received
on
this
subject
will
be
laid
before
you
.
hitherto
defensive
precaution
only
have
been
strictly
enjoined
and
observed
.
