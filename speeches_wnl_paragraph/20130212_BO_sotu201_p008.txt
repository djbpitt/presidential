the
american
people
do
n't
expect
government
to
solve
every
problem
.
they
do
n't
expect
those
of
u
in
this
chamber
to
agree
on
every
issue
.
but
they
do
expect
u
to
put
the
nation
's
interest
before
party
.
they
do
expect
u
to
forge
reasonable
compromise
where
we
can
.
for
they
know
that
america
move
forward
only
when
we
do
so
together
and
that
the
responsibility
of
improving
this
union
remains
the
task
of
u
all
.
