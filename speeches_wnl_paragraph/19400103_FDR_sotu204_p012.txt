the
identical
principle
extends
to
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
.
but
there
are
those
who
wishfully
insist
,
in
innocence
or
ignorance
or
both
,
that
the
united
state
of
america
a
a
self-contained
unit
can
live
happily
and
prosperously
,
it
future
secure
,
inside
a
high
wall
of
isolation
while
,
outside
,
the
rest
of
civilization
and
the
commerce
and
culture
of
mankind
are
shattered
.
