some
of
what
's
broken
ha
to
do
with
the
way
congress
doe
it
business
these
day
.
a
simple
majority
is
no
longer
enough
to
get
anything—even
routine
business—passed
through
the
senate
.
neither
party
ha
been
blameless
in
these
tactic
.
now
both
party
should
put
an
end
to
it
.
for
starter
,
i
ask
the
senate
to
pas
a
simple
rule
that
all
judicial
and
public
service
nomination
receive
a
simple
up-or-down
vote
within
90
day
.
