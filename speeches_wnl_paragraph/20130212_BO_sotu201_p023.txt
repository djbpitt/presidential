now
,
a
year
and
a
half
ago
,
i
put
forward
an
american
job
act
that
independent
economist
said
would
create
more
than
1
million
new
job
.
and
i
thank
the
last
congress
for
passing
some
of
that
agenda
.
i
urge
this
congress
to
pas
the
rest
.
but
tonight
i'll
lay
out
additional
proposal
that
are
fully
paid
for
and
fully
consistent
with
the
budget
framework
both
party
agreed
to
just
18
month
ago
.
let
me
repeat
:
nothing
i'm
proposing
tonight
should
increase
our
deficit
by
a
single
dime
.
it
is
not
a
bigger
government
we
need
,
but
a
smarter
government
that
set
priority
and
invests
in
broad-based
growth
.
that
's
what
we
should
be
looking
for
.
