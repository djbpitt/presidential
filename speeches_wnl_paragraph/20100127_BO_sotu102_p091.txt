now
,
our
administration
ha
had
some
political
setback
this
year
,
and
some
of
them
were
deserved
.
but
i
wake
up
every
day
knowing
that
they
are
nothing
compared
to
the
setback
that
family
all
across
this
country
have
faced
this
year
.
and
what
keep
me
going
,
what
keep
me
fighting
,
is
that
despite
all
these
setback
,
that
spirit
of
determination
and
optimism
,
that
fundamental
decency
that
ha
always
been
at
the
core
of
the
american
people
,
that
life
on
.
