in
response
to
what
i
believe
to
be
the
impulse
of
sympathy
and
opinion
throughout
the
united
state
,
i
earnestly
suggest
that
the
congress
authorize
the
treasury
of
the
united
state
to
make
to
the
struggling
government
of
armenia
such
a
loan
a
wa
made
to
several
of
the
allied
government
during
the
war
,
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
provide
in
the
legislation
itself
that
the
expenditure
of
the
money
thus
loaned
should
be
under
the
supervision
of
a
commission
,
or
at
least
a
commissioner
,
from
the
united
state
in
order
that
revolutionary
tendency
within
armenia
itself
might
not
be
afforded
by
the
loan
a
further
tempting
opportunity
.
