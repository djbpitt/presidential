in
previous
message
to
the
congress
i
have
repeatedly
warned
that
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
the
daily
life
of
american
citizen
will
,
of
necessity
,
feel
the
shock
of
event
on
other
continent
.
this
is
no
longer
mere
theory
;
because
it
ha
been
definitely
proved
to
u
by
the
fact
of
yesterday
and
today
.
