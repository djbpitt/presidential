in
doing
this
there
need
to
be
no
bloodshed
or
violence
;
and
there
shall
be
none
,
unless
it
be
forced
upon
the
national
authority
.
the
power
confided
to
me
will
be
used
to
hold
,
occupy
,
and
posse
the
property
and
place
belonging
to
the
government
,
and
to
collect
the
duty
and
impost
;
but
beyond
what
may
be
necessary
for
these
object
,
there
will
be
no
invasion
,
no
using
of
force
against
or
among
the
people
anywhere
.
where
hostility
to
the
united
state
,
in
any
interior
locality
,
shall
be
so
great
and
universal
a
to
prevent
competent
resident
citizen
from
holding
the
federal
office
,
there
will
be
no
attempt
to
force
obnoxious
stranger
among
the
people
for
that
object
.
while
the
strict
legal
right
may
exist
in
the
government
to
enforce
the
exercise
of
these
office
,
the
attempt
to
do
so
would
be
so
irritating
,
and
so
nearly
impracticable
withal
,
that
i
deem
it
better
to
forego
for
the
time
the
us
of
such
office
.
