the
american
people
will
reject
the
doctrine
of
fear
,
confident
that
in
the
'thirties
we
have
been
building
soundly
a
new
order
of
thing
,
different
from
the
order
of
the
'twenties
.
in
this
dawn
of
the
decade
of
the
'forties
,
with
our
program
of
social
improvement
started
,
we
will
continue
to
carry
on
the
process
of
recovery
,
so
a
to
preserve
our
gain
and
provide
job
at
living
wage
.
