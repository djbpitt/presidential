i
repeat
,
with
the
same
faith
and
the
same
determination
,
my
word
of
march
4
,
1933
:
``
we
face
the
arduous
day
that
lie
before
u
in
the
warm
courage
of
national
unity
;
with
a
clear
consciousness
of
seeking
old
and
precious
moral
value
;
with
a
clean
satisfaction
that
come
from
the
stern
performance
of
duty
by
old
and
young
alike
.
we
aim
at
the
assurance
of
a
rounded
and
permanent
national
life
.
we
do
not
distrust
the
future
of
essential
democracy
.
