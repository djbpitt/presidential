the
condition
in
which
our
treasury
may
be
placed
by
a
persistence
in
our
present
course
is
a
matter
of
concern
to
every
patriotic
citizen
who
doe
not
desire
his
government
to
pay
in
silver
such
of
it
obligation
a
should
be
paid
in
gold
.
nor
should
our
condition
be
such
a
to
oblige
u
,
in
a
prudent
management
of
our
affair
,
to
discontinue
the
calling
in
and
payment
of
interest-bearing
obligation
which
we
have
the
right
now
to
discharge
,
and
thus
avoid
the
payment
of
further
interest
thereon
.
