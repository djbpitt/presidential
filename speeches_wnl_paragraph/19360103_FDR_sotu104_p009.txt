within
those
other
nationsâ€”those
which
today
must
bear
the
primary
,
definite
responsibility
for
jeopardizing
world
peace
-what
hope
lie
?
to
say
the
least
,
there
are
ground
for
pessimism
.
it
is
idle
for
u
or
for
others
to
preach
that
the
mass
of
the
people
who
constitute
those
nation
which
are
dominated
by
the
twin
spirit
of
autocracy
and
aggression
,
are
out
of
sympathy
with
their
ruler
,
that
they
are
allowed
no
opportunity
to
express
themselves
,
that
they
would
change
thing
if
they
could
.
