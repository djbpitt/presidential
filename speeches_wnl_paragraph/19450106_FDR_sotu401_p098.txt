in
adopting
such
legislation
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
discard
the
voluntary
and
cooperative
process
which
have
prevailed
up
to
this
time
.
this
cooperation
ha
already
produced
great
result
.
the
contribution
of
our
worker
to
the
war
effort
ha
been
beyond
measure
.
we
must
build
on
the
foundation
that
have
already
been
laid
and
supplement
the
measure
now
in
operation
,
in
order
to
guarantee
the
production
that
may
be
necessary
in
the
critical
period
that
lie
ahead
.
