this
generation
of
american
ha
been
tested
by
crisis
that
steeled
our
resolve
and
proved
our
resilience
.
a
decade
of
war
is
now
ending
.
an
economic
recovery
ha
begun
.
america
's
possibility
are
limitless
,
for
we
posse
all
the
quality
that
this
world
without
boundary
demand
:
youth
and
drive
;
diversity
and
openness
;
an
endless
capacity
for
risk
and
a
gift
for
reinvention
.
my
fellow
american
,
we
are
made
for
this
moment
and
we
will
seize
itâ€”so
long
a
we
seize
it
together
.
