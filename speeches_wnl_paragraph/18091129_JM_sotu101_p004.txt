these
consideration
not
having
restrained
the
british
government
from
disavowing
the
arrangement
by
virtue
of
which
it
order
in
council
were
to
be
revoked
,
and
the
event
authorizing
the
renewal
of
commercial
intercourse
having
thus
not
taken
place
,
it
necessarily
became
a
question
of
equal
urgency
and
importance
whether
the
act
prohibiting
that
intercourse
wa
not
to
be
considered
a
remaining
in
legal
force
.
this
question
being
,
after
due
deliberation
,
determined
in
the
affirmative
,
a
proclamation
to
that
effect
wa
issued
.
it
could
not
but
happen
,
however
,
that
a
return
to
this
state
of
thing
from
that
which
had
followed
an
execution
of
the
arrangement
by
the
united
state
would
involve
difficulty
.
with
a
view
to
diminish
these
a
much
a
possible
,
the
instruction
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
now
laid
before
you
were
transmitted
to
the
collector
of
the
several
port
.
if
in
permitting
british
vessel
to
depart
without
giving
bond
not
to
proceed
to
their
own
port
it
should
appear
that
the
tenor
of
legal
authority
ha
not
been
strictly
pursued
,
it
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
anxious
desire
which
wa
felt
that
no
individual
should
be
injured
by
so
unforeseen
an
occurrence
;
and
i
rely
on
the
regard
of
congress
for
the
equitable
interest
of
our
own
citizen
to
adopt
whatever
further
provision
may
be
found
requisite
for
a
general
remission
of
penalty
involuntarily
incurred
.
