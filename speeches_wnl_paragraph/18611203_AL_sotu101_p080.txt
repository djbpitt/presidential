from
the
first
taking
of
our
national

great
a
it
wa
at
the
beginning
.
the
increase
of
those
other
thing
which
men
deem
desirable
ha
been
even
greater

one
view
what
the
popular

applied
to
government
through
the
machiney
,
of
the
state
and
the
union
,
ha
produced
in
a
given
time
,
and
also
what
if
firmly
maintained
it
promise
for
the
future
.
there
are
already
among
u
those
who
if
the
union
be
preserved
will
live
to
see
it
contain
250,000,000

the
struggle
of
to-day
is
not
altogether
for
to-day
;
it
is
for
a
vast
future
also
.
with
a
reliance
on

all
the
more
firm
and
earnest
