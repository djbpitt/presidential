our
destiny
offer
,
not
the
cup
of
despair
,
but
the
chalice
of
opportunity
.
so
let
u
seize
it
,
not
in
fear
,
but
in
gladness
--
and
,
``
rider
on
the
earth
together
,
''
let
u
go
forward
,
firm
in
our
faith
,
steadfast
in
our
purpose
,
cautious
of
the
danger
;
but
sustained
by
our
confidence
in
the
will
of
god
and
the
promise
of
man
.
