the
fourth
recommendation
i
do
not
deem
it
necessary
to
renew
.
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
grant
an
increase
of
rate
on
the
ground
referred
to
is
indisputably
clear
and
a
recommendation
by
the
congress
with
regard
to
such
a
matter
might
seem
to
draw
in
question
the
scope
of
the
commission
's
authority
or
it
inclination
to
do
justice
when
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
either
.
