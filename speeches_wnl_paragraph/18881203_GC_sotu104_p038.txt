this
devotion
will
lead
u
to
strongly
resist
all
impatience
of
constitutional
limitation
of
federal
power
and
to
persistently
check
the
increasing
tendency
to
extend
the
scope
of
federal
legislation
into
the
domain
of
state
and
local
jurisdiction
upon
the
plea
of
subserving
the
public
welfare
.
the
preservation
of
the
partition
between
proper
subject
of
federal
and
local
care
and
regulation
is
of
such
importance
under
the
constitution
,
which
is
the
law
of
our
very
existence
,
that
no
consideration
of
expediency
or
sentiment
should
tempt
u
to
enter
upon
doubtful
ground
.
we
have
undertaken
to
discover
and
proclaim
the
richest
blessing
of
a
free
government
,
with
the
constitution
a
our
guide
.
let
u
follow
the
way
it
point
out
;
it
will
not
mislead
u
.
and
surely
no
one
who
ha
taken
upon
himself
the
solemn
obligation
to
support
and
preserve
the
constitution
can
find
justification
or
solace
for
disloyalty
in
the
excuse
that
he
wandered
and
disobeyed
in
search
of
a
better
way
to
reach
the
public
welfare
than
the
constitution
offer
.
