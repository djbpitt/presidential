and
our
attitude
and
purpose
with
regard
to
germany
herself
are
of
a
like
kind
.
we
intend
no
wrong
against
the
german
empire
,
no
interference
with
her
internal
affair
.
we
should
deem
either
the
one
or
the
other
absolutely
unjustifiable
,
absolutely
contrary
to
the
principle
we
have
professed
to
live
by
and
to
hold
most
sacred
throughout
our
life
a
a
nation
.
