and
may
i
not
be
allowed
to
add
to
this
gratifying
spectacle
that
i
shall
read
in
the
character
of
the
american
people
,
in
their
devotion
to
true
liberty
and
to
the
constitution
which
is
it
palladium
,
sure
presage
that
the
destined
career
of
my
country
will
exhibit
a
government
pursuing
the
public
good
a
it
sole
object
,
and
regulating
it
mean
by
the
great
principle
consecrated
in
it
charger
and
by
those
moral
principle
to
which
they
are
so
well
allied
;
a
government
which
watch
over
the
purity
of
election
,
the
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
,
the
trial
by
jury
,
and
the
equal
interdict
against
encroachment
and
compact
between
religion
and
the
state
;
which
maintains
inviolably
the
maxim
of
public
faith
,
the
security
of
person
and
property
,
and
encourages
in
every
authorized
mode
the
general
diffusion
of
knowledge
which
guarantee
to
public
liberty
it
permanency
and
to
those
who
posse
the
blessing
the
true
enjoyment
of
it
;
a
government
which
avoids
intrusion
on
the
internal
repose
of
other
nation
,
and
repels
them
from
it
own
;
which
doe
justice
to
all
nation
with
a
readiness
equal
to
the
firmness
with
which
it
requires
justice
from
them
;
and
which
,
whilst
it
refines
it
domestic
code
from
every
ingredient
not
congenial
with
the
precept
of
an
enlightened
age
and
the
sentiment
of
a
virtuous
people
,
seek
by
appeal
to
reason
and
by
it
liberal
example
to
infuse
into
the
law
which
governs
the
civilized
world
a
spirit
which
may
diminish
the
frequency
or
circumscribe
the
calamity
of
war
,
and
meliorate
the
social
and
beneficent
relation
of
peace
;
a
government
,
in
a
word
,
whose
conduct
within
and
without
may
bespeak
the
most
noble
of
ambition
-
that
of
promoting
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
man
.
