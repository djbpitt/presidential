we
and
our
ally
have
declared
that
it
is
our
purpose
to
respect
the
right
of
all
people
to
choose
the
form
of
government
under
which
they
will
live
and
to
see
sovereign
right
and
self-government
restored
to
those
who
have
been
forcibly
deprived
of
them
.
but
with
internal
dissension
,
with
many
citizen
of
liberated
country
still
prisoner
of
war
or
forced
to
labor
in
germany
,
it
is
difficult
to
guess
the
kind
of
self-government
the
people
really
want
.
