in
connection
with
this
subject
i
desire
to
suggest
the
advisability
,
if
it
be
found
not
obnoxious
to
constitutional
objection
,
of
investing
united
state
commissioner
with
the
power
to
try
and
determine
certain
violation
of
law
within
the
grade
of
misdemeanor
.
such
trial
might
be
made
to
depend
upon
the
option
of
the
accused
.
the
multiplication
of
small
and
technical
offense
,
especially
under
the
provision
of
our
internal-revenue
law
,
render
some
change
in
our
present
system
very
desirable
in
the
interest
of
humanity
a
well
a
economy
.
the
district
court
are
now
crowded
with
petty
prosecution
,
involving
a
punishment
in
case
of
conviction
,
of
only
a
slight
fine
,
while
the
party
accused
are
harassed
by
an
enforced
attendance
upon
court
held
hundred
of
mile
from
their
home
.
if
poor
and
friendless
,
they
are
obliged
to
remain
in
jail
during
month
,
perhaps
,
that
elapse
before
a
session
of
the
court
is
held
,
and
are
finally
brought
to
trial
surrounded
by
stranger
and
with
but
little
real
opportunity
for
defense
.
in
the
meantime
frequently
the
marshal
ha
charged
against
the
government
his
fee
for
an
arrest
,
the
transportation
of
the
accused
and
the
expense
of
the
same
,
and
for
summoning
witness
before
a
commissioner
,
a
grand
jury
,
and
a
court
;
the
witness
have
been
paid
from
the
public
fund
large
fee
and
traveling
expense
,
and
the
commissioner
and
district
attorney
have
also
made
their
charge
against
the
government
.
