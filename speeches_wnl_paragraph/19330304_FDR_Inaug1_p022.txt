but
in
the
event
that
the
congress
shall
fail
to
take
one
of
these
two
course
,
and
in
the
event
that
the
national
emergency
is
still
critical
,
i
shall
not
evade
the
clear
course
of
duty
that
will
then
confront
me
.
i
shall
ask
the
congress
for
the
one
remaining
instrument
to
meet
the
crisisâ€”broad
executive
power
to
wage
a
war
against
the
emergency
,
a
great
a
the
power
that
would
be
given
to
me
if
we
were
in
fact
invaded
by
a
foreign
foe
.
