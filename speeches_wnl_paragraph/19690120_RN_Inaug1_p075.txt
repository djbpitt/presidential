in
that
moment
of
surpassing
technological
triumph
,
men
turned
their
thought
toward
home
and
humanity
--
seeing
in
that
far
perspective
that
man
's
destiny
on
earth
is
not
divisible
;
telling
u
that
however
far
we
reach
into
the
cosmos
,
our
destiny
lie
not
in
the
star
but
on
earth
itself
,
in
our
own
hand
,
in
our
own
heart
.
