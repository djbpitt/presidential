we
are
justified
in
our
present
confidence
.
restoration
of
national
income
,
which
show
continuing
gain
for
the
third
successive
year
,
support
the
normal
and
logical
policy
under
which
agriculture
and
industry
are
returning
to
full
activity
.
under
these
policy
we
approach
a
balance
of
the
national
budget
.
national
income
increase
;
tax
receipt
,
based
on
that
income
,
increase
without
the
levying
of
new
tax
.
that
is
why
i
am
able
to
say
to
this
,
the
second
session
of
the
74th
congress
,
that
it
is
my
belief
based
on
existing
law
that
no
new
tax
,
over
and
above
the
present
tax
,
are
either
advisable
or
necessary
.
