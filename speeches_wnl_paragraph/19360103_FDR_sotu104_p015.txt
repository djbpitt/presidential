that
is
equally
true
today
,
and
it
is
even
more
true
today
that
world
peace
and
world
good-will
are
blocked
by
only
10
or
15
percent
of
the
world
's
population
.
that
is
why
effort
to
reduce
army
have
thus
far
not
only
failed
,
but
have
been
met
by
vastly
increased
armament
on
land
and
in
the
air
.
that
is
why
even
effort
to
continue
the
existing
limit
on
naval
armament
into
the
year
to
come
show
such
little
current
success
.
