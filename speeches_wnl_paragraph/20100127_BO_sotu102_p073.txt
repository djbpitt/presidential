now
,
throughout
our
history
,
no
issue
ha
united
this
country
more
than
our
security
.
sadly
,
some
of
the
unity
we
felt
after
9/11
ha
dissipated
.
and
we
can
argue
all
we
want
about
who
's
to
blame
for
this
,
but
i
'm
not
interested
in
relitigating
the
past
.
i
know
that
all
of
u
love
this
country
.
all
of
u
are
committed
to
it
defense
.
so
let
's
put
aside
the
schoolyard
taunt
about
who
's
tough
.
let
's
reject
the
false
choice
between
protecting
our
people
and
upholding
our
value
.
let
's
leave
behind
the
fear
and
division
and
do
what
it
take
to
defend
our
nation
and
forge
a
more
hopeful
future
for
america
and
for
the
world
.
