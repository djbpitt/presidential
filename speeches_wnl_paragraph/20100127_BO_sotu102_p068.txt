of
course
,
none
of
these
reform
will
even
happen
if
we
do
n't
also
reform
how
we
work
with
one
another
.
now
,
i
'm
not
naive
.
i
never
thought
that
the
mere
fact
of
my
election
would
usher
in
peace
and
harmony
andâ€”some
postpartisan
era
.
i
knew
that
both
party
have
fed
division
that
are
deeply
entrenched
.
and
on
some
issue
,
there
are
simply
philosophical
difference
that
will
always
cause
u
to
part
way
.
these
disagreement
,
about
the
role
of
government
in
our
life
,
about
our
national
priority
and
our
national
security
,
they
've
been
taking
place
for
over
200
year
.
they
're
the
very
essence
of
our
democracy
.
