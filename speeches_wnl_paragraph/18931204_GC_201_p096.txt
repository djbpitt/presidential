the
business
of
the
mail
indicates
with
absolute
certainty
the
condition
of
the
business
of
the
country
,
and
depression
in
financial
affair
inevitably
and
quickly
reduces
the
postal
revenue
.
therefore
a
larger
discrepancy
than
usual
between
the
post-office
receipt
and
expenditure
is
the
expected
and
unavoidable
result
of
the
distressing
stringency
which
ha
prevailed
throughout
the
country
during
much
of
the
time
covered
by
the
postmaster-general
's
report
.
at
a
date
when
better
time
were
anticipated
it
wa
estimated
by
his
predecessor
that
the
deficiency
on
the
30th
day
of
june
,
1893
,
would
be
but
a
little
over
a
million
and
a
half
dollar
.
it
amounted
,
however
,
to
more
than
five
million
.
at
the
same
time
and
under
the
influence
of
like
anticipation
estimate
were
made
for
the
current
fiscal
year
,
ending
june
30
,
1894
,
which
exhibited
a
surplus
of
revenue
over
expenditure
of
$
872,245.71
;
but
now
,
in
view
of
the
actual
receipt
and
expenditure
during
that
part
of
the
current
fiscal
year
already
expired
,
the
present
postmaster-general
estimate
that
at
it
close
instead
of
a
surplus
there
will
be
a
deficiency
of
nearly
$
8,000,000
.
