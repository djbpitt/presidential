the
equal
and
exact
justice
of
which
we
boast
a
the
underlying
principle
of
our
institution
should
not
be
confined
to
the
relation
of
our
citizen
to
each
other
.
the
government
itself
is
under
bond
to
the
american
people
that
in
the
exercise
of
it
function
and
power
it
will
deal
with
the
body
of
our
citizen
in
a
manner
scrupulously
honest
and
fair
and
absolutely
just
.
it
ha
agreed
that
american
citizenship
shall
be
the
only
credential
necessary
to
justify
the
claim
of
equality
before
the
law
,
and
that
no
condition
in
life
shall
give
rise
to
discrimination
in
the
treatment
of
the
people
by
their
government
.
