overconfidence
and
complacency
are
among
our
deadliest
enemy
.
last
spring—after
notable
victory
at
stalingrad
and
in
tunisia
and
against
the
u-boat
on
the
high
seas—overconfidence
became
so
pronounced
that
war
production
fell
off
.
in
two
month
,
june
and
july
,
1943
,
more
than
a
thousand
airplane
that
could
have
been
made
and
should
have
been
made
were
not
made
.
those
who
failed
to
make
them
were
not
on
strike
.
they
were
merely
saying
,
``
the
war
's
in
the
bag-
so
let
's
relax
.
