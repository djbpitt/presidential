the
interpretation
of
our
existing
treaty
of
naturalization
by
germany
during
the
past
year
ha
attracted
attention
by
reason
of
an
apparent
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
imperial
government
to
extend
the
scope
of
the
residential
restriction
to
which
returning
naturalized
citizen
of
german
origin
are
asserted
to
be
liable
under
the
law
of
the
empire
.
the
temperate
and
just
attitude
taken
by
this
government
with
regard
to
this
class
of
question
will
doubtless
lead
to
a
satisfactory
understanding
.
