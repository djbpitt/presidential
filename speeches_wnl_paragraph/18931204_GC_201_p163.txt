it
seems
to
me
to
be
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
this
reform
,
a
well
a
with
it
best
enforcement
,
to
oblige
the
commission
to
rely
for
clerical
assistance
upon
clerk
detailed
from
other
department
.
there
ought
not
to
be
such
a
condition
in
any
department
that
clerk
hired
to
do
work
there
can
be
spared
to
habitually
work
at
another
place
,
and
it
doe
not
accord
with
a
sensible
view
of
civil-service
reform
that
person
should
be
employed
on
the
theory
that
their
labor
is
necessary
in
one
department
when
in
point
of
fact
their
service
are
devoted
to
entirely
different
work
in
another
department
.
