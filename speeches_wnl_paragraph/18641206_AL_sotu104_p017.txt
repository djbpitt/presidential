owing
to
the
peculiar
situation
of
japan
and
the
anomalous
form
of
it
government
,
the
action
of
that
empire
in
performing
treaty
stipulation
is
inconstant
and
capricious
.
nevertheless
,
good
progress
ha
been
effected
by
the
western
power
,
moving
with
enlightened
concert
.
our
own
pecuniary
claim
have
been
allowed
or
put
in
course
of
settlement
,
and
the
inland
sea
ha
been
reopened
to
commerce
.
there
is
reason
also
to
believe
that
these
proceeding
have
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
friendship
of
japan
toward
the
united
state
.
