although
this
matter
,
in
the
stage
referred
to
,
concern
only
the
concurrent
treaty-making
power
of
one
branch
of
congress
,
i
advert
to
it
in
view
of
the
interest
repeatedly
and
conspicuously
shown
by
you
in
your
legislative
capacity
in
favor
of
a
speedy
and
equitable
adjustment
of
the
question
growing
out
of
the
discredited
judgment
of
the
previous
mixed
commission
of
caracas
.
with
every
desire
to
do
justice
to
the
representation
of
venezuela
in
this
regard
,
the
time
seems
to
have
come
to
end
this
matter
,
and
i
trust
the
prompt
confirmation
by
both
party
of
the
supplementary
action
referred
to
will
avert
the
need
of
legislative
or
other
action
to
prevent
the
longer
withholding
of
such
right
of
actual
claimant
a
may
be
shown
to
exist
.
