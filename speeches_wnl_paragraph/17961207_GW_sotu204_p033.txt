a
reenforcement
of
the
existing
provision
for
discharging
our
public
debt
wa
mentioned
in
my
address
at
the
opening
of
the
last
session
.
some
preliminary
step
were
taken
toward
it
,
the
maturing
of
which
will
no
doubt
engage
your
zealous
attention
during
the
present
.
i
will
only
add
that
it
will
afford
me
a
heart-felt
satisfaction
to
concur
in
such
further
measure
a
will
ascertain
to
our
country
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
extinguishment
of
the
debt
.
posterity
may
have
cause
to
regret
if
from
any
motive
interval
of
tranquillity
are
left
unimproved
for
accelerating
this
valuable
end
.
