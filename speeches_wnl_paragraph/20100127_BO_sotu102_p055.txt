nowâ€”just
stating
the
fact
.
now
,
if
we
had
taken
office
in
ordinary
time
,
i
would
have
liked
nothing
more
than
to
start
bringing
down
the
deficit
.
but
we
took
office
amid
a
crisis
.
and
our
effort
to
prevent
a
second
depression
have
added
another
$
1
trillion
to
our
national
debt
.
that
too
is
a
fact
.
