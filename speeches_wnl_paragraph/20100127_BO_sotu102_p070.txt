washington
may
think
that
saying
anything
about
the
other
side
,
no
matter
how
false
,
no
matter
how
malicious
,
is
just
part
of
the
game
.
but
it
's
precisely
such
politics
that
ha
stopped
either
party
from
helping
the
american
people
.
worse
yet
,
it
's
sowing
further
division
among
our
citizen
,
further
distrust
in
our
government
.
so
,
no
,
i
will
not
give
up
on
trying
to
change
the
tone
of
our
politics
.
i
know
it
's
an
election
year
.
and
after
last
week
,
it
's
clear
that
campaign
fever
ha
come
even
earlier
than
usual
.
but
we
still
need
to
govern
.
