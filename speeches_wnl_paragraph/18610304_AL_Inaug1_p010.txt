there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
whether
this
clause
should
be
enforced
by
national
or
by
state
authority
;
but
surely
that
difference
is
not
a
very
material
one
.
if
the
slave
is
to
be
surrendered
,
it
can
be
of
but
little
consequence
to
him
or
to
others
by
which
authority
it
is
done
.
and
should
anyone
in
any
case
be
content
that
his
oath
shall
go
unkept
on
a
merely
unsubstantial
controversy
a
to
how
it
shall
be
kept
?
