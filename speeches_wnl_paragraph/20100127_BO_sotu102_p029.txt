we
ca
n't
afford
another
so-called
economic
``
expansion
''
like
the
one
from
the
last
decade
,
what
some
call
the
``
lost
decade
,
''
where
job
grew
more
slowly
than
during
any
prior
expansion
,
where
the
income
of
the
average
american
household
declined
while
the
cost
of
health
care
and
tuition
reached
record
high
,
where
prosperity
wa
built
on
a
housing
bubble
and
financial
speculation
.
