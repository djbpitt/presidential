we
understand
that
outworn
program
are
inadequate
to
the
need
of
our
time
.
so
we
must
harness
new
idea
and
technology
to
remake
our
government
,
revamp
our
tax
code
,
reform
our
school
,
and
empower
our
citizen
with
the
skill
they
need
to
work
harder
,
learn
more
,
reach
higher
.
but
while
the
mean
will
change
,
our
purpose
endures
:
a
nation
that
reward
the
effort
and
determination
of
every
single
american
.
that
is
what
this
moment
requires
.
that
is
what
will
give
real
meaning
to
our
creed
.
