it
appears
that
the
number
of
desertion
ha
diminished
,
but
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
they
numbered
2,927
;
and
one
instance
is
given
by
the
lieutenant-general
of
six
desertion
by
the
same
recruit
.
i
am
convinced
that
this
number
of
desertion
can
be
much
diminished
by
better
discipline
and
treatment
;
but
the
punishment
should
be
increased
for
repeated
offense
.
