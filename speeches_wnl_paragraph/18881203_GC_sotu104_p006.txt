the
citizen
of
our
republic
in
it
early
day
rigidly
insisted
upon
full
compliance
with
the
letter
of
this
bond
,
and
saw
stretching
out
before
him
a
clear
field
for
individual
endeavor
.
his
tribute
to
the
support
of
his
government
wa
measured
by
the
cost
of
it
economical
maintenance
,
and
he
wa
secure
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
remaining
recompense
of
his
steady
and
contented
toil
.
in
those
day
the
frugality
of
the
people
wa
stamped
upon
their
government
,
and
wa
enforced
by
the
free
,
thoughtful
,
and
intelligent
suffrage
of
the
citizen
.

,
monopoly
,
and
aggregation
of
capital
were
either
avoided
or
sternly
regulated
and
restrained
.
the
pomp
and
glitter
of
government
le
free
offered
no
temptation
and
presented
no
delusion
to
the
plain
people
who
,
side
by
side
,
in
friendly
competition
,
wrought
for
the
ennoblement
and
dignity
of
man
,
for
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
free
government
,
and
for
the
achievement
of
the
grand
destiny
awaiting
the
land
which
