now
,
that
's
what
i
came
to
washington
to
do
.
that
's
why
,
for
the
first
time
in
history
,
my
administration
post
onâ€”our
white
house
visitor
online
.
that
's
why
we
've
excluded
lobbyist
from
policymaking
job
or
seat
on
federal
board
and
commission
.
but
we
ca
n't
stop
there
.
it
's
time
to
require
lobbyist
to
disclose
each
contact
they
make
on
behalf
of
a
client
,
with
my
administration
or
with
congress
.
it
's
time
to
put
strict
limit
on
the
contribution
that
lobbyist
give
to
candidate
for
federal
office
.
