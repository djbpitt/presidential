under
these
circumstance
i
have
been
urgently
solicited
to
establish
by
military
power
court
to
administer
summary
justice
in
such
case
i
have
thus
far
declined
to
do
it
,
not
because
i
had
any
doubt
that
the
end
proposed
--
the
collection
of
the
debt
--
wa
just
and
right
in
itself
,
but
because
i
have
been
unwilling
to
go
beyond
the
pressure
of
necessity
in
the
unusual
exercise
of
power
.
but
the
power
of
congress
,
i
suppose
,
are
equal
to
the
anomalous
occasion
,
and
therefore
i
refer
the
whole
matter
to
congress
,
with
the
hope
that
a
plan
may
be
devised
for
the
administration
of
justice
in
all
such
part
of
the
insurgent
state
and
territory
a
may
be
under
the
control
of
this
government
,
whether
by
a
voluntary
return
to
allegiance
and
order
or
by
the
power
of
our
arm
;
this
,
however
,
not
to
be
a
permanent
institution
,
but
a
temporary
substitute
,
and
to
cease
a
soon
a
the
ordinay
court
can
be
reestablished
in
peace
.
