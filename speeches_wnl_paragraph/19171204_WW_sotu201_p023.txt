recent
experience
ha
convinced
me
that
the
congress
must
go
further
in
authorizing
the
government
to
set
limit
to
price
.
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
,
i
am
sorry
to
say
,
ha
been
replaced
by
the
law
of
unrestrained
selfishness
.
while
we
have
eliminated
profiteering
in
several
branch
of
industry
it
still
run
impudently
rampant
in
others
.
the
farmer
,
for
example
,
complain
with
a
great
deal
of
justice
that
,
while
the
regulation
of
food
price
restricts
their
income
,
no
restraint
are
placed
upon
the
price
of
most
of
the
thing
they
must
themselves
purchase
;
and
similar
inequity
obtain
on
all
side
.
