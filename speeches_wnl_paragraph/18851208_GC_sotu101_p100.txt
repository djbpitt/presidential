past
congress
have
had
under
consideration
the
advisability
of
abolishing
the
discrimination
made
by
the
tariff
law
in
favor
of
the
work
of
american
artist
.
the
odium
of
the
policy
which
subject
to
a
high
rate
of
duty
the
painting
of
foreign
artist
and
exempts
the
production
of
american
artist
residing
abroad
,
and
who
receive
gratuitously
advantage
and
instruction
,
is
visited
upon
our
citizen
engaged
in
art
culture
in
europe
,
and
ha
caused
them
with
practical
unanimity
to
favor
the
abolition
of
such
an
ungracious
distinction
;
and
in
their
interest
,
and
for
other
obvious
reason
,
i
strongly
recommend
it
.
