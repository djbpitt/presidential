it
is
argued
that
we
have
passed
the
stage
in
the
war
where
national
service
is
necessary
.
but
our
soldier
and
sailor
know
that
this
is
not
true
.
we
are
going
forward
on
a
long
,
rough
road-
and
,
in
all
journey
,
the
last
mile
are
the
hardest
.
and
it
is
for
that
final
effortâ€”for
the
total
defeat
of
our
enemies-that
we
must
mobilize
our
total
resource
.
the
national
war
program
call
for
the
employment
of
more
people
in
1944
than
in
1943
.
