our
progress
out
of
the
depression
is
obvious
.
but
that
is
not
all
that
you
and
i
mean
by
the
new
order
of
thing
.
our
pledge
wa
not
merely
to
do
a
patchwork
job
with
second-hand
material
.
by
using
the
new
material
of
social
justice
we
have
undertaken
to
erect
on
the
old
foundation
a
more
enduring
structure
for
the
better
use
of
future
generation
.
