but
here
i
can
not
forbear
to
recommend
a
repeal
of
the
tax
on
the
transportation
of
public
print
.
there
is
no
resource
so
firm
for
the
government
of
the
united
state
a
the
affection
of
the
people
,
guided
by
an
enlightened
policy
;
and
to
this
primary
good
nothing
can
conduce
more
than
a
faithful
representation
of
public
proceeding
,
diffused
without
restraint
throughout
the
united
state
.
