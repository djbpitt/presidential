to
the
preceeding
observation
i
have
one
to
add
,
which
will
be
most
properly
addressed
to
the
house
of
representative
.
it
concern
myself
,
and
will
therefore
be
a
brief
a
possible
.
when
i
wa
first
honoured
with
a
call
into
the
service
of
my
country
,
then
on
the
eve
of
an
arduous
struggle
for
it
liberty
,
the
light
in
which
i
contemplated
my
duty
required
that
i
should
renounce
every
pecuniary
compensation
.
from
this
resolution
i
have
in
no
instance
departed
.
and
being
still
under
the
impression
which
produced
it
,
i
must
decline
a
inapplicable
to
myself
,
any
share
in
the
personal
emolument
,
which
may
be
indispensably
included
in
a
permanent
provision
for
the
executive
department
;
and
must
accordingly
pray
that
the
pecuniary
estimate
for
the
station
in
which
i
am
placed
,
may
,
during
my
continuance
in
it
,
be
limited
to
such
actual
expenditure
a
the
public
good
may
be
thought
to
require
.
