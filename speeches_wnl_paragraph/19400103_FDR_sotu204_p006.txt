you
are
well
aware
that
dictatorships—and
the
philosophy
of
force
that
justifies
and
accompanies
dictatorships—have
originated
in
almost
every
case
in
the
necessity
for
drastic
action
to
improve
internal
condition
in
place
where
democratic
action
for
one
reason
or
another
ha
failed
to
respond
to
modern
need
and
modern
demand
.
