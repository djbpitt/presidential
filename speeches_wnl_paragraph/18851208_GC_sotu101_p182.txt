inspired
,
a
i
am
,
by
the
hope
,
shared
by
all
patriotic
citizen
,
that
the
day
is
not
very
far
distant
when
our
navy
will
be
such
a
befits
our
standing
among
the
nation
of
the
earth
,
and
rejoiced
at
every
step
that
lead
in
the
direction
of
such
a
consummation
,
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
especially
direct
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
close
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
,
in
which
the
humiliating
weakness
of
the
present
organization
of
his
department
is
exhibited
and
the
startling
abuse
and
waste
of
it
present
method
are
exposed
.
the
conviction
is
forced
upon
u
with
the
certainty
of
mathematical
demonstration
that
before
we
proceed
further
in
the
restoration
of
a
navy
we
need
a
thoroughly
reorganized
navy
department
.
the
fact
that
within
seventeen
year
more
than
$
75,000,000
have
been
spent
in
the
construction
,
repair
,
equipment
,
and
armament
of
vessel
,
and
the
further
fact
that
instead
of
an
effective
and
creditable
fleet
we
have
only
the
discontent
and
apprehension
of
a
nation
undefended
by
war
vessel
,
added
to
the
disclosure
now
made
,
do
not
permit
u
to
doubt
that
every
attempt
to
revive
our
navy
ha
thus
far
for
the
most
part
been
misdirected
,
and
all
our
effort
in
that
direction
have
been
little
better
than
blind
gropings
and
expensive
,
aimless
folly
.
