in
my
great
desire
for
the
success
of
this
measure
i
can
not
restrain
the
suggestion
that
it
success
can
only
be
attained
by
mean
of
unselfish
counsel
on
the
part
of
the
friend
of
tariff
reform
and
a
a
result
of
their
willingness
to
subordinate
personal
desire
and
ambition
to
the
general
good
.
the
local
interest
affected
by
the
proposed
reform
are
so
numerous
and
so
varied
that
if
all
are
insisted
upon
the
legislation
embodying
the
reform
must
inevitably
fail
.
