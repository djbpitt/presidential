i
should
not
be
frank
if
i
did
not
admit
concern
about
many
situationsâ€”the
greek
and
polish
for
example
.
but
those
situation
are
not
a
easy
or
a
simple
to
deal
with
a
some
spokesman
,
whose
sincerity
i
do
not
question
,
would
have
u
believe
.
we
have
obligation
,
not
necessarily
legal
,
to
the
exiled
government
,
to
the
underground
leader
,
and
to
our
major
ally
who
came
much
nearer
the
shadow
than
we
did
.
