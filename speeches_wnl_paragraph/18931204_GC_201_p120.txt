although
the
law
of
1890
permit
pension
for
disability
not
related
to
military
service
,
yet
a
a
requisite
to
it
benefit
a
disability
must
exist
incapacitating
applicant
``
from
the
performance
of
manual
labor
to
such
a
degree
a
to
render
them
unable
to
earn
a
support

''
the
execution
of
this
law
in
it
early
stage
doe
not
seem
to
have
been
in
accord
with
it
true
intention
,
but
toward
the
close
of
the
last
administration
an
authoritative
construction
wa
given
to
the
statute
,
and
since
that
time
this
construction
ha
been
followed
.
this
ha
had
the
effect
of
limiting
the
operation
of
the
law
to
it
intended
purpose
.
the
discovery
having
been
made
that
many
name
had
been
put
upon
the
pension
roll
by
mean
of
wholesale
and
gigantic
fraud
,
the
commissioner
suspended
payment
upon
a
number
of
pension
which
seemed
to
be
fraudulent
or
unauthorized
pending
a
complete
examination
,
giving
notice
to
the
pensioner
,
in
order
that
they
might
have
an
opportunity
to
establish
,
if
possible
,
the
justice
of
their
claim
notwithstanding
apparent
invalidity
.
