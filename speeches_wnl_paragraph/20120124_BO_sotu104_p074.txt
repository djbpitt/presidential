tax
reform
should
follow
the
buffett
rule
.
if
you
make
more
than
a
million
dollar
a
year
,
you
should
not
pay
le
than
30
percent
in
tax
.
and
my
republican
friend
tom
coburn
is
right
:
washington
should
stop
subsidizing
millionaire
.
in
fact
,
if
you're
earning
a
million
dollar
a
year
,
you
should
n't
get
special
tax
subsidy
or
deduction
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
you
make
under
$
250,000
a
year
,
like
98
percent
of
american
family
,
your
tax
should
n't
go
up
.
you
're
the
one
struggling
with
rising
cost
and
stagnant
wage
.
you
're
the
one
who
need
relief
.
