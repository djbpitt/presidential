one
of
the
most
heartening
event
of
the
year
in
the
international
field
ha
been
the
renaissance
of
the
french
people
and
the
return
of
the
french
nation
to
the
rank
of
the
united
nation
.
far
from
having
been
crushed
by
the
terror
of
nazi
domination
,
the
french
people
have
emerged
with
stronger
faith
than
ever
in
the
destiny
of
their
country
and
in
the
soundness
of
the
democratic
ideal
to
which
the
french
nation
ha
traditionally
contributed
so
greatly
.
