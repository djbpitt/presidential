immediate
passage
of
the
bill
to
regulate
the
expenditure
of
money
in

may
seem
to
be
le
necessary
than
the
immediate
enactment
of
the
other
measure
to
which

refer
,
because
at

two
year
will
elapse
before
another
election
in
which

office
are
to

it
would
greatly
relieve
the
public

if
this

matter
were
dealt
with

under

the
method

be
frankly
studied
in
