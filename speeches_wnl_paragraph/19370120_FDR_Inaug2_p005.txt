this
year
mark
the
one
hundred
and
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
constitutional
convention
which
made
u
a
nation
.
at
that
convention
our
forefather
found
the
way
out
of
the
chaos
which
followed
the
revolutionary
war
;
they
created
a
strong
government
with
power
of
united
action
sufficient
then
and
now
to
solve
problem
utterly
beyond
individual
or
local
solution
.
a
century
and
a
half
ago
they
established
the
federal
government
in
order
to
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessing
of
liberty
to
the
american
people
.
