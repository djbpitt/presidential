a
the
present
statute
when
enacted
wa
in
the
nature
of
the
case
more
or
le
tentative
and
experimental
,
it
wa
hardly
expected
to
supply
a
complete
and
adequate
system
.
while
it
wholesome
effect
are
manifest
and
have
amply
justified
it
enactment
,
it
is
evident
that
all
desired
reform
in
transportation
method
have
not
been
fully
accomplished
.
in
view
of
the
judicial
interpretation
which
some
provision
of
this
statute
have
received
and
the
defect
disclosed
by
the
effort
made
for
it
enforcement
,
it
revision
and
amendment
appear
to
be
essential
,
to
the
end
that
it
may
more
effectually
reach
the
evil
designed
to
be
corrected
.
i
hope
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
upon
this
subject
will
be
promptly
and
favorably
considered
by
the
congress
.
