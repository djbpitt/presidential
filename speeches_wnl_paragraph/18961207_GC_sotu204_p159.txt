in
considering
project
for
the
retirement
of
united
state
note
and
treasury
note
issued
under
the
law
of
1890
,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
we
have
placed
too
much
stress
upon
the
danger
of
contracting
the
currency
and
have
calculated
too
little
upon
the
gold
that
would
be
added
to
our
circulation
if
invited
to
u
by
better
and
safer
financial
method
.
it
is
not
so
much
a
contraction
of
our
currency
that
should
be
avoided
a
it
unequal
distribution
.
