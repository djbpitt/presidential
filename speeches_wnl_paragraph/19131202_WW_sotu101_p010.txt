department

seeking
to
assist
a
never
before

make
farming
an
efficient
business
,
of
wide
co-operative
effort
,
in
quick
touch
with
the
market
for
foodstuff
.
the
farmer
and
the
government
will
henceforth
work
together
a
real
partner
in
this
field
,
where
we
now
begin
to
see
our
way
very
clearly
and
where
many
intelligent
plan
are
already
being
put
into
execution
.
the
treasury
of
the
united
state
ha
,
by
a
timely
and
well-considered
distribution
of
it
deposit
,
facilitated
the
moving
of
the
crop
in
the
present
season
and
prevented
the
scarcity
of
available
fund
too
often
experienced
at
such
time
.
but
we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
depend
upon
extraordinary
expedient
.
we
must
add
the
mean
by
which
the
,
farmer
may
make
his
credit
constantly
and
easily
available
and
command
when
he
will
the
capital
by
which
to
support
and
expand
his
business

behind
many
other
great

of
the
modern
world
in
attempting
to
do

developed
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
while
we
left
our
farmer
to
shift
for
themselves
in
the
ordinary
money
market
.
you
have
but
to
look
about
you
in
any
rural
district
to
see
the
result
,
the
handicap
and
embarrassment
which
