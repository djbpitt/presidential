we
refuse
the
european
solution
of
using
the
unemployed
to
build
up
excessive
armament
which
eventually
result
in
dictatorship
and
war
.
we
encourage
an
american
wayâ€”through
an
increase
of
national
income
which
is
the
only
way
we
can
be
sure
will
take
up
the
slack
.
much
progress
ha
been
made
;
much
remains
to
be
done
.
