now
,
the
good
news
is
we
can
make
meaningful
progress
on
this
issue
while
driving
strong
economic
growth
.
i
urge
this
congress
to
get
together
,
pursue
a
bipartisan
,
market-based
solution
to
climate
change
,
like
the
one
john
mccain
and
joe
lieberman
worked
on
together
a
few
year
ago
.
but
if
congress
wo
n't
act
soon
to
protect
future
generation
,
i
will
.
i
will
direct
my
cabinet
to
come
up
with
executive
action
we
can
take
,
now
and
in
the
future
,
to
reduce
pollution
,
prepare
our
community
for
the
consequence
of
climate
change
,
and
speed
the
transition
to
more
sustainable
source
of
energy
.
