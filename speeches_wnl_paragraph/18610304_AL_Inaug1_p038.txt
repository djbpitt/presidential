my
countryman
,
one
and
all
,
think
calmly
and
well
upon
this
whole
subject
.
nothing
valuable
can
be
lost
by
taking
time
.
if
there
be
an
object
to
hurry
any
of
you
in
hot
haste
to
a
step
which
you
would
never
take
deliberately
,
that
object
will
be
frustrated
by
taking
time
;
but
no
good
object
can
be
frustrated
by
it
.
such
of
you
a
are
now
dissatisfied
,
still
have
the
old
constitution
unimpaired
,
and
,
on
the
sensitive
point
,
the
law
of
your
own
framing
under
it
;
while
the
new
administration
will
have
no
immediate
power
,
if
it
would
,
to
change
either
.
if
it
were
admitted
that
you
who
are
dissatisfied
hold
the
right
side
in
the
dispute
,
there
still
is
no
single
good
reason
for
precipitate
action
.
intelligence
,
patriotism
,
christianity
,
and
a
firm
reliance
on
him
who
ha
never
yet
forsaken
this
favored
land
,
are
still
competent
to
adjust
in
the
best
way
all
our
present
difficulty
.
