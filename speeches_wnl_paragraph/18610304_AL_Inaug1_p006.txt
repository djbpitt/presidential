i
now
reiterate
these
sentiment
;
and
,
in
doing
so
,
i
only
press
upon
the
public
attention
the
most
conclusive
evidence
of
which
the
case
is
susceptible
,
that
the
property
,
peace
,
and
security
of
no
section
are
to
be
in
any
wise
endangered
by
the
now
incoming
administration
.
i
add
,
too
,
that
all
the
protection
which
,
consistently
with
the
constitution
and
the
law
,
can
be
given
,
will
be
cheerfully
given
to
all
the
state
when
lawfully
demanded
,
for
whatever
causeâ€”as
cheerfully
to
one
section
a
to
another
.
