it
is
important
that
some
more
convenient
mean
should
be
provided
,
if
possible
,
for
the
adjustment
of
claim
against
the
government
,
especially
in
view
of
their
increased
number
by
reason
of
the
war
.
it
is
a
much
the
duty
of
government
to
render
prompt
justice
against
itself
in
favor
of
citizen
a
it
is
to
administer
the
same
between
private
individual
.
the
investigation
and
adjudication
of
claim
in
their
nature
belong
to
the
judicial
department
.
besides
,
it
is
apparent
that
the
attention
of
congress
will
be
more
than
usually
engaged
for
some
time
to
come
with
great
national
question
.
it
wa
intended
by
the
organization
of
the
court
of
claim
mainly
to
remove
this
branch
of
business
from
the
hall
of
congress
:
but
while
the
court
ha
proved
to
be
an
effective
and
valuable
mean
of
investigation
,
it
in
great
degree
fails
to
effect
the
object
of
it
creation
for
want
of
power
to
make
it
judgment
final
.
