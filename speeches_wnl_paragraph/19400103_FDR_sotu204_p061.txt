these
words-
''
national
unity
''
-must
not
be
allowed
to
be
come
merely
a
high-sounding
phrase
,
a
vague
generality
,
a
pious
hope
,
to
which
everyone
can
give
lip-service
.
they
must
be
made
to
have
real
meaning
in
term
of
the
daily
thought
and
act
of
every
man
,
woman
and
child
in
our
land
during
the
coming
year
and
during
the
year
that
lie
ahead
.
