i
remember
that
my
old
schoolmaster
,
dr.
peabody
,
said
in
day
that
seemed
to
u
then
to
be
secure
and
untroubled
,
``
thing
in
life
will
not
always
run
smoothly
.
sometimes
we
will
be
rising
toward
the
heightsâ€”then
all
will
seem
to
reverse
itself
and
start
downward
.
the
great
fact
to
remember
is
that
the
trend
of
civilization
itself
is
forever
upward
;
that
a
line
drawn
through
the
middle
of
the
peak
and
the
valley
of
the
century
always
ha
an
upward
trend
.
