if
there
is
anything
in
the
theory
of
a
representation
in
public
place
of
the
people
and
their
desire
,
if
public
officer
are
really
the
servant
of
the
people
,
and
if
political
promise
and
profession
have
any
binding
force
,
our
failure
to
give
the
relief
so
long
awaited
will
be
sheer
recreancy
.
nothing
should
intervene
to
distract
our
attention
or
disturb
our
effort
until
this
reform
is
accomplished
by
wise
and
careful
legislation
.
