acting
under
the
authority
conferred
upon
the
president
by
congress
,
i
have
already
accorded
the
people
of
the
island
a
majority
in
both
house
of
their
legislative
body
by
appointing
five
instead
of
four
native
citizen
to
the
membership
of
the
commission
.
i
believe
that
in
this
way
we
shall
make
proof
of
their
capacity
in
counsel
and
their
sense
of
responsibility
in
the
exercise
of
political
power
,
and
that
the
success
of
this
step
will
be
sure
to
clear
our
view
for
the
step
which
are
to
follow
.
step
by
step
we
should
extend
and
perfect
the
system
of
self-government
in
the
island
,
making
test
of
them
and
modifying
them
a
experience
discloses
their
success
and
their
failure
;
that
we
should
more
and
more
put
under
the
control
of
the
native
citizen
of
the
archipelago
the
essential
instrument
of
their
life
,
their
local
instrumentality
of
government
,
their
school
,
all
the
common
interest
of
their
community
,
and
so
by
counsel
and
experience
set
tip
a
government
which
all
the
world
will
see
to
be
suitable
to
a
people
whose
affair
are
under
their
own
control
.
at
last
,
i
hope
and
believe
,
we
are
beginning
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
filipino
people
.
by
their
counsel
and
experience
,
rather
than
by
our
own
,
we
shall
learn
how
best
to
serve
them
and
how
soon
it
will
be
possible
and
wise
to
withdraw
our
supervision
.
let
u
once
find
the
path
and
set
out
with
firm
and
confident
tread
upon
it
and
we
shall
not
wander
from
it
or
linger
upon
it
.
