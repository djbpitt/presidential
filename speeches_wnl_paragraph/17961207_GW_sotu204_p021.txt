true
it
is
that
our
country
,
much
to
it
honor
,
contains
many
seminary
of
learning
highly
repeatable
and
useful
;
but
the
fund
upon
which
they
rest
are
too
narrow
to
command
the
ablest
professor
in
the
different
department
of
liberal
knowledge
for
the
institution
contemplated
,
though
they
would
be
excellent
auxiliary
.
