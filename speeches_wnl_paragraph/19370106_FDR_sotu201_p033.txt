i
have
recently
visited
three
of
our
sister
republic
in
south
america
.
the
very
cordial
reception
with
which
i
wa
greeted
were
in
tribute
to
democracy
.
to
me
the
outstanding
observation
of
that
visit
wa
that
the
mass
of
the
people
of
all
the
america
are
convinced
that
the
democratic
form
of
government
can
be
made
to
succeed
and
do
not
wish
to
substitute
for
it
any
other
form
of
government
.
they
believe
that
democracy
are
best
able
to
cope
with
the
changing
problem
of
modern
civilization
within
themselves
,
and
that
democracy
are
best
able
to
maintain
peace
among
themselves
.
