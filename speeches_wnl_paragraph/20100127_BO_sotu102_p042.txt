to
make
college
more
affordable
,
this
bill
will
finally
end
the
unwarranted
taxpayer
subsidy
that
go
to
bank
for
student
loan
.
instead
,
let
's
take
that
money
and
give
family
a
$
10,000
tax
credit
for
4
year
of
college
and
increase
pell
grant
.
and
let's
tell
another
1
million
student
that
when
they
graduate
,
they
will
be
required
to
pay
only
10
percent
of
their
income
on
student
loan
and
all
of
their
debt
will
be
forgiven
after
20
yearsâ€”and
forgiven
after
10
year
if
they
choose
a
career
in
public
service
,
because
in
the
united
state
of
america
,
no
one
should
go
broke
because
they
chose
to
go
to
college
.
and
by
the
way
,
it
's
time
for
college
and
university
to
get
serious
about
cutting
their
own
cost
,
because
they
too
have
a
responsibility
to
help
solve
this
problem
.
