just
and
sensible
revision

the
relief
of
those
of
our
countryman
who
suffer
under

condition
.

a
revision
should
receive
the
support

justice
and
equality
due

american
citizenship
;
of
all

;
of
all
who
believe
that
the
contented
competence
and
comfort
of
many
accord
better
with
the

colossal
fortune
unfairly
gathered
in
the
hand
of
a
few
;
of
all

are
the
surest
guaranty
