you
will
remember
that
on
that
fourth
of
march
,
1933
,
the
world
picture
wa
an
image
of
substantial
peace
.
international
consultation
and
widespread
hope
for
the
bettering
of
relation
between
the
nation
gave
to
all
of
u
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
barrier
to
mutual
confidence
,
to
increased
trade
,
and
to
the
peaceful
settlement
of
dispute
could
be
progressively
removed
.
in
fact
,
my
only
reference
to
the
field
of
world
policy
in
that
address
wa
in
these
word
:
``
i
would
dedicate
this
nation
to
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor—the
neighbor
who
resolutely
respect
himself
and
,
because
he
doe
so
,
respect
the
right
of
others—a
neighbor
who
respect
his
obligation
and
respect
the
sanctity
of
his
agreement
in
and
with
a
world
of
neighbor
.
