the
period
of
my
retiring
from
the
public
service
being
at
little
distance
,
i
shall
find
no
occasion
more
proper
than
the
present
for
expressing
to
my
fellow
citizen
my
deep
sense
of
the
continued
confidence
and
kind
support
which
i
have
received
from
them
.
my
grateful
recollection
of
these
distinguished
mark
of
their
favorable
regard
can
never
cease
,
and
with
the
consciousness
that
,
if
i
have
not
served
my
country
with
greater
ability
,
i
have
served
it
with
a
sincere
devotion
will
accompany
me
a
a
source
of
unfailing
gratification
.
