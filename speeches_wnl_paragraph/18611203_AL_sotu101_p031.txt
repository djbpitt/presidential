there
are
three
vacancy
on
the
bench
of
the
supreme
court
--
two
by
the
decease
of
justice
daniel
and
mclean
and
one
by
the
resignation
of
justice
campbell
.
i
have
so
far
forborne
making
nomination
to
fill
these
vacancy
for
reason
which
i
will
now
state
.
two
of
the
outgoing
judge
resided
within
the
state
now
overrun
by
revolt
,
so
that
if
successor
were
appointed
in
the
same
locality
they
could
not
now
serve
upon
their
circuit
;
and
many
of
the
most
competent
men
there
probably
would
not
take
the
personal
hazard
of
accepting
to
serve
,
even
here
,
upon
the
supreme
bench
.
i
have
been
unwilling
to
throw
all
the
appointment
northward
,
thus
disabling
myself
from
doing
justice
to
the
south
on
the
return
of
peace
;
although
i
may
remark
that
to
transfer
to
the
north
one
which
ha
heretofore
been
in
the
south
would
not
,
with
reference
to
territory
and
population
,
be
unjust
.
