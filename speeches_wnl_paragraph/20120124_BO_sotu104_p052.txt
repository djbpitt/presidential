our
experience
with
shale
gas
,
our
experience
with
natural
gas
,
show
u
that
the
payoff
on
these
public
investment
do
n't
always
come
right
away
.
some
technology
do
n't
pan
out
,
some
company
fail
.
but
i
will
not
walk
away
from
the
promise
of
clean
energy
.
i
will
not
walk
away
from
worker
like
bryan
.
i
will
not
cede
the
wind
or
solar
or
battery
industry
to
china
or
germany
because
we
refuse
to
make
the
same
commitment
here
.
