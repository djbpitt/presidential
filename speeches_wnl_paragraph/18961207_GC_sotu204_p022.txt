it
would
seem
that
if
spain
should
offer
to
cuba
genuine
autonomy
--
a
measure
of
home
rule
which
,
while
preserving
the
sovereignty
of
spain
,
would
satisfy
all
rational
requirement
of
her
spanish
subject
--
there
should
be
no
just
reason
why
the
pacification
of
the
island
might
not
be
effected
on
that
basis
.
such
a
result
would
appear
to
be
in
the
true
interest
of
all
concerned
.
it
would
at
once
stop
the
conflict
which
is
now
consuming
the
resource
of
the
island
and
making
it
worthless
for
whichever
party
may
ultimately
prevail
.
it
would
keep
intact
the
possession
of
spain
without
touching
her
honor
,
which
will
be
consulted
rather
than
impugned
by
the
adequate
redress
of
admitted
grievance
.
it
would
put
the
prosperity
of
the
island
and
the
fortune
of
it
inhabitant
within
their
own
control
without
severing
the
natural
and
ancient
tie
which
bind
them
to
the
mother
country
,
and
would
yet
enable
them
to
test
their
capacity
for
self-government
under
the
most
favorable
condition
.
it
ha
been
objected
on
the
one
side
that
spain
should
not
promise
autonomy
until
her
insurgent
subject
lay
down
their
arm
;
on
the
other
side
,
that
promised
autonomy
,
however
liberal
,
is
insufficient
,
because
without
assurance
of
the
promise
being
fulfilled
.
