during
the
past
year
the
work
of
constructing
permanent
infantry
and
cavalry
post
ha
been
continued
at
the
place
heretofore
designated
.
the
secretary
of
war
repeat
his
recommendation
that
appropriation
for
barrack
and
quarter
should
more
strictly
conform
to
the
need
of
the
service
a
judged
by
the
department
rather
than
respond
to
the
wish
and
importunity
of
locality
.
it
is
imperative
that
much
of
the
money
provided
for
such
construction
should
now
be
allotted
to
the
erection
of
necessary
quarter
for
the
garrison
assigned
to
the
coast
defense
,
where
many
men
will
be
needed
to
properly
care
for
and
operate
modern
gun
.
it
is
essential
,
too
,
that
early
provision
be
made
to
supply
the
necessary
force
of
artillery
to
meet
the
demand
of
this
service
.
