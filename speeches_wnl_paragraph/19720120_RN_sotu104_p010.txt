i
am
not
presenting
proposal
which
have
attractive
label
but
no
hope
of
passage
.
i
am
presenting
only
vital
program
which
are
within
the
capacity
of
this
congress
to
enact
,
within
the
capacity
of
the
budget
to
finance
,
and
which
i
believe
should
be
above
partisanship
--
program
which
deal
with
urgent
priority
for
the
nation
,
which
should
and
must
be
the
subject
of
bipartisan
action
by
this
congress
in
the
interest
of
the
country
in
1972
.
