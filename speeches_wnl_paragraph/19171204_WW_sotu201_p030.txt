it
is
because
it
is
for
u
a
war
of
high
,
disinterested
purpose
,
in
which
all
the
free
people
of
the
world
are
banded
together
for
the
vindication
of
right
,
a
war
for
the
preservation
of
our
nation
and
of
all
that
it
ha
held
dear
of
principle
and
of
purpose
,
that
we
feel
ourselves
doubly
constrained
to
propose
for
it
outcome
only
that
which
is
righteous
and
of
irreproachable
intention
,
for
our
foe
a
well
a
for
our
friend
.
the
cause
being
just
and
holy
,
the
settlement
must
be
of
like
motive
and
quality
.
for
this
we
can
fight
,
but
for
nothing
le
noble
or
le
worthy
of
our
tradition
.
for
this
cause
we
entered
the
war
and
for
this
cause
will
we
battle
until
the
last
gun
is
fired
.
