the
old
condition
of
world
trade
made
for
no
enduring
peace
;
and
when
the
time
come
,
the
united
state
must
use
it
influence
to
open
up
the
trade
channel
of
the
world
,
in
all
nation
,
in
order
that
no
one
nation
need
feel
compelled
in
later
day
to
seek
by
force
of
arm
what
it
can
well
gain
by
peaceful
conference
.
for
that
purpose
,
too
,
we
need
the
trade
agreement
act
even
more
today
than
when
it
wa
passed
.
