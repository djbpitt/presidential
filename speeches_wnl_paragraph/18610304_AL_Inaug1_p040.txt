i
am
loath
to
close
.
we
are
not
enemy
,
but
friend
.
we
must
not
be
enemy
.
though
passion
may
have
strained
,
it
must
not
break
our
bond
of
affection
.
the
mystic
chord
of
memory
,
stretching
from
every
battle-field
and
patriot
grave
to
every
living
heart
and
hearthstone
all
over
this
broad
land
,
will
yet
swell
the
chorus
of
the
union
when
again
touched
,
a
surely
they
will
be
,
by
the
better
angel
of
our
nature
.
