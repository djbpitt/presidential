the
easy
and
unguarded
manner
in
which
certificate
of
american
citizenship
can
now
be
obtained
ha
induced
a
class
,
unfortunately
large
,
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
become
absolved
from
allegiance
to
their
native
land
,
and
yet
by
a
foreign
residence
to
escape
any
just
duty
and
contribution
of
service
to
the
country
of
their
proposed
adoption
.
thus
,
while
evading
the
duty
of
citizenship
to
the
united
state
,

may
make
prompt
claim
for
it
national
protection
and
demand
it
intervention
in
their
behalf
.
international
complication
of
a
serious
nature
arise
,
and
the
correspondence
of
the
state
department
discloses
the
great
number
and
complexity
of
the
question
which
have
been
raised
.
