the
condition
of
business
in
the
court
of
the
united
state
is
such
that
there
seems
to
be
an
imperative
necessity
for
remedial
legislation
on
the
subject
.
some
of
these
court
are
so
overburdened
with
pending
cause
that
the
delay
in
determining
litigation
amount
often
to
a
denial
of
justice
.
among
the
plan
suggested
for
relief
is
one
submitted
by
the
attorney-general
.
it
main
feature
are
:
the
transfer
of
all
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
court
to
the
district
court
and
an
increase
of
judge
for
the
latter
where
necessary
;
an
addition
of
judge
to
the
circuit
court
,
and
constituting
them
exclusively
court
of
appeal
,
and
reasonably
limiting
appeal
thereto
;
further
restriction
of
the
right
to
remove
cause
from
the
state
to
federal
court
;
permitting
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
from
the
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territory
only
in
the
same
case
a
they
are
allowed
from
state
court
,
and
guarding
against
an
unnecessary
number
of
appeal
from
the
circuit
court
.
