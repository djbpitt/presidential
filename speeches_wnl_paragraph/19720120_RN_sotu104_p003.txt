i
shall
never
forget
that
moment
.
the
senate
,
the
diplomatic
corp
,
the
supreme
court
,
the
cabinet
entered
the
chamber
,
and
then
the
president
of
the
united
state
.
a
all
of
you
are
aware
,
i
had
some
difference
with
president
truman
.
he
had
some
with
me
.
but
i
remember
that
on
that
day
--
the
day
he
addressed
that
joint
session
of
the
newly
elected
republican
80th
congress
,
he
spoke
not
a
a
partisan
,
but
a
president
of
all
the
people-calling
upon
the
congress
to
put
aside
partisan
consideration
in
the
national
interest
.
