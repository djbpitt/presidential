in
the
state
which
ha
been
presented
of
our
affair
with
the
great
party
to
a
disastrous
and
protracted
war
,
carried
on
in
a
mode
equally
injurious
and
unjust
to
the
united
state
a
a
neutral
nation
,
the
wisdom
of
the
national
legislature
will
be
again
summoned
to
the
important
decision
on
the
alternative
before
them
.
that
these
will
be
met
in
a
spirit
worthy
the
council
of
a
nation
conscious
both
of
it
rectitude
and
of
it
right
,
and
careful
a
well
of
it
honor
a
of
it
peace
,
i
have
an
entire
confidence
;
and
that
the
result
will
be
stamped
by
a
unanimity
becoming
the
occasion
,
and
be
supported
by
every
portion
of
our
citizen
with
a
patriotism
enlightened
and
invigorated
by
experience
,
ought
a
little
to
be
doubted
.
