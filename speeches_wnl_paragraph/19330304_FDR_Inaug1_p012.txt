finally
,
in
our
progress
toward
a
resumption
of
work
we
require
two
safeguard
against
a
return
of
the
evil
of
the
old
order
:
there
must
be
a
strict
supervision
of
all
banking
and
credit
and
investment
,
so
that
there
will
be
an
end
to
speculation
with
other
people
's
money
;
and
there
must
be
provision
for
an
adequate
but
sound
currency
.
