important
movement
have
also
occurred
during
the
year
to
the
effect
of
molding
society
for
durability
in
the
union
.
although
short
of
complete
success
,
it
is
much
in
the
fight
direction
that
12,000
citizen
in
each
of
the
state
of
arkansas
and
louisiana
have
organized
loyal
state
government
,
with
free
constitution
,
and
are
earnestly
struggling
to
maintain
and
administer
them
.
the
movement
in
the
same
direction
,
more
extensive
though
le
definite
,
in
missouri
,
kentucky
,
and
tennessee
should
not
be
overlooked
.
but
maryland
present
the
example
of
complete
success
.
maryland
is
secure
to
liberty
and
union
for
all
the
future
.
the
genius
of
rebellion
will
no
more
claim
maryland
.
like
another
foul
spirit
being
driven
out
,
it
may
seek
to
tear
her
,
but
it
will
woo
her
no-more
.
