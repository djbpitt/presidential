the
demand
upon
the
pension
office
will
be
largely
increased
by
the
insurrection
.
numerous
application
for
pension
,
based
upon
the
casualty
of
the
existing
war
,
have
already
been
made
.
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
many
who
are
now
upon
the
pension
roll
and
in
receipt
of
the
bounty
of
the
government
are
in
the
rank
of
the
insurgent
army
or
giving
them
aid
and
comfort
.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
ha
directed
a
suspension
of
the
payment
of
the
pension
of
such
person
upon
proof
of
their
disloyalty
.
i
recommend
that
congress
authorize
that
officer
to
cause
the
name
of
such
person
to
be
stricken
from
the
pension
roll
.
