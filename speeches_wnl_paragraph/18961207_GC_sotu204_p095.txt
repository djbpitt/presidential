the
construction
of
vessel
for
our
new
navy
ha
been
energetically
prosecuted
by
the
present
administration
upon
the
general
line
previously
adopted
,
the
department
having
seen
no
necessity
for
radical
change
in
prior
method
,
under
which
the
work
wa
found
to
be
progressing
in
a
manner
highly
satisfactory
.
it
ha
been
decided
,
however
,
to
provide
in
every
shipbuilding
contract
that
the
builder
should
pay
all
trial
expense
,
and
it
ha
also
been
determined
to
pay
no
speed
premium
in
future
contract
.
the
premium
recently
earned
and
some
yet
to
be
decided
are
feature
of
the
contract
made
before
this
conclusion
wa
reached
.
