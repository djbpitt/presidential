several
alleged
reason
have
prevented
the
enactment
of
legislation
which
would
preserve
for
our
soldier
and
sailor
and
marine
the
fundamental
prerogative
of
citizenshipâ€”the
right
to
vote
.
no
amount
of
legalistic
argument
can
becloud
this
issue
in
the
eye
of
these
ten
million
american
citizen
.
surely
the
signer
of
the
constitution
did
not
intend
a
document
which
,
even
in
wartime
,
would
be
construed
to
take
away
the
franchise
of
any
of
those
who
are
fighting
to
preserve
the
constitution
itself
.
