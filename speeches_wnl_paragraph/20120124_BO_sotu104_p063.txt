there
's
no
question
that
some
regulation
are
outdated
,
unnecessary
,
or
too
costly
.
in
fact
,
i
've
approved
fewer
regulation
in
the
first
3
year
of
my
presidency
than
my
republican
predecessor
did
in
his
.
i
've
ordered
every
federal
agency
to
eliminate
rule
that
do
n't
make
sense
.
we
've
already
announced
over
500
reform
,
and
just
a
fraction
of
them
will
save
business
and
citizen
more
than
$
10
billion
over
the
next
5
year
.
we
got
rid
of
one
rule
from
40
year
ago
that
could
have
forced
some
dairy
farmer
to
spend
$
10,000
a
year
proving
that
they
could
contain
a
spill
,
because
milk
wa
somehow
classified
a
an
oil
.
with
a
rule
like
that
,
i
guess
it
wa
worth
cry
over
spilled
milk
.
