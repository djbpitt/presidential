but
from
another
point
of
view
i
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
say
plainly
what
we
here
at
the
seat
of
action
consider
the
war
to
be
for
and
what
part
we
mean
to
play
in
the
settlement
of
it
searching
issue
.
we
are
the
spokesman
of
the
american
people
and
they
have
a
right
to
know
whether
their
purpose
is
ours
.
they
desire
peace
by
the
overcoming
of
evil
,
by
the
defeat
once
for
all
of
the
sinister
force
that
interrupt
peace
and
render
it
impossible
,
and
they
wish
to
know
how
closely
our
thought
run
with
theirs
and
what
action
we
propose
.
they
are
impatient
with
those
who
desire
peace
by
any
sort
of
compromise
--
deeply
and
indignantly
impatient
--
but
they
will
be
equally
impatient
with
u
if
we
do
not
make
it
plain
to
them
what
our
objective
are
and
what
we
are
planning
for
in
seeking
to
make
conquest
of
peace
by
arm
.
