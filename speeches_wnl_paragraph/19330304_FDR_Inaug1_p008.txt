happiness
lie
not
in
the
mere
possession
of
money
;
it
lie
in
the
joy
of
achievement
,
in
the
thrill
of
creative
effort
.
the
joy
and
moral
stimulation
of
work
no
longer
must
be
forgotten
in
the
mad
chase
of
evanescent
profit
.
these
dark
day
will
be
worth
all
they
cost
u
if
they
teach
u
that
our
true
destiny
is
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
to
ourselves
and
to
our
fellow
men
.
