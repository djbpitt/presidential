it
will
not
be
disputed
that
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
cause
the
circulation
of
silver
dollar
worth
80
cent
side
by
side
with
gold
dollar
worth
100
cent
,
even
within
the
limit
that
legislation
doe
not
run
counter
to
the
law
of
trade
,
to
be
successful
must
be
seconded
by
the
confidence
of
the
people
that
both
coin
will
retain
the
same
purchasing
power
and
be
interchangeable
at
will
.
a
special
effort
ha
been
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
increase
the
amount
of
our
silver
coin
in
circulation
;
but
the
fact
that
a
large
share
of
the
limited
amount
thus
put
out
ha
soon
returned
to
the
public
treasury
in
payment
of
duty
lead
to
the
belief
that
the
people
do
not
now
desire
to
keep
it
in
hand
,
and
this
,
with
the
evident
disposition
to
hoard
gold
,
give
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
there
already
exists
a
lack
of
confidence
among
the
people
touching
our
financial
process
.
there
is
certainly
not
enough
silver
now
in
circulation
to
cause
uneasiness
,
and
the
whole
amount
coined
and
now
on
hand
might
after
a
time
be
absorbed
by
the
people
without
apprehension
;
but
it
is
the
ceaseless
stream
that
threatens
to
overflow
the
land
which
cause
fear
and
uncertainty
.
