for
myself
,
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
power
and
duty
of
the
executive
,
under
the
law
of
nation
,
to
exclude
enemy
of
the
human
race
from
an
asylum
in
the
united
state
.
if
congress
should
think
that
proceeding
in
such
case
lack
the
authority
of
law
,
or
ought
to
be
further
regulated
by
it
,
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
effectually
preventing
foreign
slave
trader
from
acquiring
domicile
and
facility
for
their
criminal
occupation
in
our
country
.
