above
all
,
we
have
the
inestimable
consolation
of
knowing
that
the
war
in
which
we
are
actually
engaged
is
a
war
neither
of
ambition
nor
of
vain
glory
;
that
it
is
waged
not
in
violation
of
the
right
of
others
,
but
in
the
maintenance
of
our
own
;
that
it
wa
preceded
by
a
patience
without
example
under
wrong
accumulating
without
end
,
and
that
it
wa
finally
not
declared
until
every
hope
of
averting
it
wa
extinguished
by
the
transfer
of
the
british
scepter
into
new
hand
clinging
to
former
council
,
and
until
declaration
were
reiterated
to
the
last
hour
,
through
the
british
envoy
here
,
that
the
hostile
edict
against
our
commercial
right
and
our
maritime
independence
would
not
be
revoked
;
nay
,
that
they
could
not
be
revoked
without
violating
the
obligation
of
great
britain
to
other
power
,
a
well
a
to
her
own
interest
.
