having
thus
imparted
to
you
my
sentiment
,
a
they
have
been
awakened
by
the
occasion
which
brings
u
together
,
i
shall
take
my
present
leave
;
but
not
without
resorting
once
more
to
the
benign
parent
of
the
human
race
,
in
humble
supplication
that
since
he
ha
been
pleased
to
favour
the
american
people
,
with
opportunity
for
deliberating
in
perfect
tranquility
,
and
disposition
for
deciding
with
unparellelled
unanimity
on
a
form
of
government
,
for
the
security
of
their
union
,
and
the
advancement
of
their
happiness
;
so
his
divine
blessing
may
be
equally
conspicuous
in
the
enlarged
view
,
the
temperate
consultation
,
and
the
wise
measure
on
which
the
success
of
this
government
must
depend
.
