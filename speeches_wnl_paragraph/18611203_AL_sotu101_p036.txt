it
seems
to
me
very
important
that
the
statute
law
should
be
made
a
plain
and
intelligible
a
possible
,
and
be
reduced
to
a
small
a
compass
a
may
consist
with
the
fullness
and
precision
of
the
will
of
the
legislature
and
the
perspicuity
of
it
language
.
this
well
done
would
,
i
think
,
greatly
facilitate
the
labor
of
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
assist
in
the
administration
of
the
law
,
and
would
be
a
lasting
benefit
to
the
people
,
by
placing
before
them
in
a
more
accessible
and
intelligible
form
the
law
which
so
deeply
concern
their
interest
and
their
duty
.
