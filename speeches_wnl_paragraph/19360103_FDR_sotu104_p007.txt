were
i
today
to
deliver
an
inaugural
address
to
the
people
of
the
united
state
,
i
could
not
limit
my
comment
on
world
affair
to
one
paragraph
.
with
much
regret
i
should
be
compelled
to
devote
the
greater
part
to
world
affair
.
since
the
summer
of
that
same
year
of
1933
,
the
temper
and
the
purpose
of
the
ruler
of
many
of
the
great
population
in
europe
and
in
asia
have
not
pointed
the
way
either
to
peace
or
to
good-will
among
men
.
not
only
have
peace
and
good-will
among
men
grown
more
remote
in
those
area
of
the
earth
during
this
period
,
but
a
point
ha
been
reached
where
the
people
of
the
america
must
take
cognizance
of
growing
ill-will
,
of
marked
trend
toward
aggression
,
of
increasing
armament
,
of
shortening
tempersâ€”a
situation
which
ha
in
it
many
of
the
element
that
lead
to
the
tragedy
of
general
war
.
