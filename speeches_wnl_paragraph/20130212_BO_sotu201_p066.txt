now
,
a
we
do
,
we
must
enlist
our
value
in
the
fight
.
that
's
why
my
administration
ha
worked
tirelessly
to
forge
a
durable
legal
and
policy
framework
to
guide
our
counterterrorism
effort
.
throughout
,
we
have
kept
congress
fully
informed
of
our
effort
.
i
recognize
that
in
our
democracy
,
no
one
should
just
take
my
word
for
it
that
we
're
doing
thing
the
right
way
.
so
,
in
the
month
ahead
,
i
will
continue
to
engage
congress
to
ensure
not
only
that
our
targeting
,
detention
,
and
prosecution
of
terrorist
remains
consistent
with
our
law
and
system
of
check
and
balance
,
but
that
our
effort
are
even
more
transparent
to
the
american
people
and
to
the
world
.
