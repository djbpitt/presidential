though
congress
ha
attempted
to
deal
with
this
matter
by
legislation
,
the
law
passed
for
that
purpose
thus
far
have
proved
ineffective
,
not
because
of
any
lack
of
disposition
or
attempt
to
enforce
them
,
but
simply
because
the
law
themselves
a
interpreted
by
the
court
do
not
reach
the
difficulty
.
if
the
insufficiency
of
existing
law
can
be
remedied
by
further
legislation
,
it
should
be
done
.
the
fact
must
be
recognized
,
however
,
that
all
federal
legislation
on
this
subject
may
fall
short
of
it
purpose
because
of
inherent
obstacle
and
also
because
of
the
complex
character
of
our
governmental
system
,
which
,
while
making
the
federal
authority
supreme
within
it
sphere
,
ha
carefully
limited
that
sphere
by
mete
and
bound
that
can
not
be
transgressed
.
the
decision
of
our
highest
court
on
this
precise
question
render
it
quite
doubtful
whether
the
evil
of
trust
and
monopoly
can
be
adequately
treated
through
federal
action
unless
they
seek
directly
and
purposely
to
include
in
their
object
transportation
or
intercourse
between
state
or
between
the
united
state
and
foreign
country
.
