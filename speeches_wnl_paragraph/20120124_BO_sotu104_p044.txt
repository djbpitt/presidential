after
all
,
innovation
is
what
america
ha
always
been
about
.
most
new
job
are
created
in
startup
and
small
business
.
so
let
's
pas
an
agenda
that
help
them
succeed
.
tear
down
regulation
that
prevent
aspiring
entrepreneur
from
getting
the
financing
to
grow
.
expand
tax
relief
to
small
business
that
are
raising
wage
and
creating
good
job
.
both
party
agree
on
these
idea
.
so
put
them
in
a
bill
and
get
it
on
my
desk
this
year
.
