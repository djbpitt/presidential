a
bill
proposed
by
the
postmaster-general
wa
introduced
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
by
which
a
uniform
standard
in
the
amount
of
gross
receipt
would
fix
the
right
of
a
community
to
a
public
building
to
be
erected
by
the
government
for
post-office
purpose
.
it
wa
demonstrated
that
,
aside
from
the
public
convenience
and
the
promotion
of
harmony
among
citizen
,
invariably
disturbed
by
change
of
leasings
and
of
site
,
it
wa
a
measure
of
the
highest
economy
and
of
sound
business
judgment
.
it
wa
found
that
the
government
wa
paying
in
rent
at
the
rate
of
from
7
to
10
per
cent
per
annum
on
what
the
cost
of
such
public
building
would
be
.
a
very
great
advantage
resulting
from
such
a
law
would
be
the
prevention
of
a
large
number
of
bill
constantly
introduced
for
the
erection
of
public
building
at
place
,
and
involving
expenditure
not
justified
by
public
necessity
.
i
trust
that
this
measure
will
become
a
law
at
the
present
session
of
congress
.
