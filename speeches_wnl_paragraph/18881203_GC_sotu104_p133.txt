i
earnestly
request
that
the
recommendation
contained
in
the
secretary
's
report
,
all
of
which
are
,
in
my
opinion
,
calculated
to
increase
the
usefulness
and
discipline
of
the
army
,
may
receive
the
consideration
of
the
congress
.
among
these
the
proposal
that
there
should
be
provided
a
plan
for
the
examination
of
officer
to
test
their
fitness
for
promotion
is
of
the
utmost
importance
.
this
reform
ha
been
before
recommended
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
,
and
it
expediency
is
so
fully
demonstrated
by
the
argument
he
present
in
it
favor
that
it
adoption
should
no
longer
be
neglected
.
