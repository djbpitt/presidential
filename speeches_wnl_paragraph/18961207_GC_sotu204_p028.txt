a
contemplation
of
emergency
that
may
arise
should
plainly
lead
u
to
avoid
their
creation
,
either
through
a
careless
disregard
of
present
duty
or
even
an
undue
stimulation
and
ill-timed
expression
of
feeling
.
but
i
have
deemed
it
not
amiss
to
remind
the
congress
that
a
time
may
arrive
when
a
correct
policy
and
care
for
our
interest
,
a
well
a
a
regard
for
the
interest
of
other
nation
and
their
citizen
,
joined
by
consideration
of
humanity
and
a
desire
to
see
a
rich
and
fertile
country
intimately
related
to
u
saved
from
complete
devastation
,
will
constrain
our
government
to
such
action
a
will
subserve
the
interest
thus
involved
and
at
the
same
time
promise
to
cuba
and
it
inhabitant
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
blessing
of
peace
.
