i
desire
also
to
earnestly
suggest
the
wisdom
of
amending
the
existing
statute
in
regard
to
the
issuance
of
government
bond
.
the
authority
now
vested
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
issue
bond
is
not
a
clear
a
it
should
be
,
and
the
bond
authorized
are
disadvantageous
to
the
government
both
a
to
the
time
of
their
maturity
and
rate
of
interest
.
