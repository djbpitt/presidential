now
,
i
know
that
some
in
my
own
party
will
argue
that
we
ca
n't
address
the
deficit
or
freeze
government
spending
when
so
many
are
still
hurting
.
and
i
agree
,
which
is
why
this
freeze
wo
n't
take
effect
until
next
year
,
when
the
economy
is
stronger
.
that
's
how
budgeting
work
.
but
understand
,
if
we
do
n't
take
meaningful
step
to
rein
in
our
debt
,
it
could
damage
our
market
,
increase
the
cost
of
borrowing
,
and
jeopardize
our
recovery
,
all
of
which
would
have
an
even
worse
effect
on
our
job
growth
and
family
income
.
