the
public
debt
on
the
1st
day
of
july
last
,
a
appears
by
the
book
of
the
treasury
,
amounted
to
$
1,740,690,489.49
.
probably
,
should
the
war
continue
for
another
year
,
that
amount
may
be
increased
by
not
far
from
five
hundred
million
.
held
,
a
it
is
,
for
the
most
part
by
our
own
people
,
it
ha
become
a
substantial
branch
of
national
,
though
private
,
property
.
for
obvious
reason
the
more
nearly
this
property
can
be
distributed
among
all
the
people
the
better
.
to
favor
such
general
distribution
,
greater
inducement
to
become
owner
might
,
perhaps
,
with
good
effect
and
without
injury
be
presented
to
person
of
limited
mean
.
with
this
view
i
suggest
whether
it
might
not
be
both
competent
and
expedient
for
congress
to
provide
that
a
limited
amount
of
some
future
issue
of
public
security
might
be
held
by
any
bona
fide
purchaser
exempt
from
taxation
and
from
seizure
for
debt
,
under
such
restriction
and
limitation
a
might
be
necessary
to
guard
against
abuse
of
so
important
a
privilege
.
this
would
enable
every
prudent
person
to
set
aside
a
small
annuity
against
a
possible
day
of
want
.
