we
also
know
that
when
student
do
n't
walk
away
from
their
education
,
more
of
them
walk
the
stage
to
get
their
diploma
.
when
student
are
not
allowed
to
drop
out
,
they
do
better
.
so
tonight
i
am
proposing
that
every
state—every
state—requires
that
all
student
stay
in
high
school
until
they
graduate
or
turn
18
.
