while
in
our
external
relation
some
serious
inconvenience
and
embarrassment
have
been
overcome
and
others
lessened
,
it
is
with
much
pain
and
deep
regret
i
mention
that
circumstance
of
a
very
unwelcome
nature
have
lately
occurred
.
our
trade
ha
suffered
and
is
suffering
extensive
injury
in
the
west
indie
from
the
cruiser
and
agent
of
the
french
republic
,
and
communication
have
been
received
from
it
minister
here
which
indicate
the
danger
of
a
further
disturbance
of
our
commerce
by
it
authority
,
and
which
are
in
other
respect
far
from
agreeable
.
