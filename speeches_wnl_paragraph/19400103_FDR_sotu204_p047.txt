behind
the
army
and
navy
,
of
course
,
lie
our
ultimate
line
of
defense—
''
the
general
welfare
''
of
our
people
.
we
can
not
report
,
despite
all
the
progress
that
we
have
made
in
our
domestic
problems—despite
the
fact
that
production
is
back
to
1929
levels—that
all
our
problem
are
solved
.
the
fact
of
unemployment
of
million
of
men
and
woman
remains
a
symptom
of
a
number
of
difficulty
in
our
economic
system
not
yet
adjusted
.
