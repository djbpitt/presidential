for
example
,
many
million
of
american
still
live
in
habitation
which
not
only
fail
to
provide
the
physical

of
modern
civilization
but
breed

and
impair
the
health
of
future
generation

menace
exists
not
only
in
the
slum
area
of
the
very
large
city
,
but
in
many
smaller
city
a
well
.
it
exists
on
ten
of
thousand
of
farm
,
in
varying
degree
,
in
every
part
of
the
country
.
