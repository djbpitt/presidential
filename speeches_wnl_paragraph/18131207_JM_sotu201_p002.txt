in
meeting
you
at
the
present
interesting
conjuncture
it
would
have
been
highly
satisfactory
if
i
could
have
communicated
a
favorable
result
to
the
mission
charged
with
negotiation
for
restoring
peace
.
it
wa
a
just
expectation
,
from
the
respect
due
to
the
distinguished
sovereign
who
had
invited
them
by
his
offer
of
mediation
,
from
the
readiness
with
which
the
invitation
wa
accepted
on
the
part
of
the
united
state
,
and
from
the
pledge
to
be
found
in
an
act
of
their
legislature
for
the
liberality
which
their
plenipotentiary
would
carry
into
the
negotiation
,
that
no
time
would
be
lost
by
the
british
government
in
embracing
the
experiment
for
hastening
a
stop
to
the
effusion
of
blood
.
a
prompt
and
cordial
acceptance
of
the
mediation
on
that
side
wa
the
le
to
be
doubted
,
a
it
wa
of
a
nature
not
to
submit
right
or
pretension
on
either
side
to
the
decision
of
an
umpire
,
but
to
afford
merely
an
opportunity
,
honorable
and
desirable
to
both
,
for
discussing
and
,
if
possible
,
adjusting
them
for
the
interest
of
both
.
