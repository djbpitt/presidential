for
these
american
and
so
many
others
,
change
ha
not
come
fast
enough
.
some
are
frustrated
,
some
are
angry
.
they
do
n't
understand
why
it
seems
like
bad
behavior
on
wall
street
is
rewarded
,
but
hard
work
on
main
street
is
n't
,
or
why
washington
ha
been
unable
or
unwilling
to
solve
any
of
our
problem
.
they
're
tired
of
the
partisanship
and
the
shouting
and
the
pettiness
.
they
know
we
ca
n't
afford
it
.
not
now
.
