it
is
our
duty
now
to
begin
to
lay
the
plan
and
determine
the
strategy
for
the
winning
of
a
lasting
peace
and
the
establishment
of
an
american
standard
of
living
higher
than
ever
before
known
.
we
can
not
be
content
,
no
matter
how
high
that
general
standard
of
living
may
be
,
if
some
fraction
of
our
peopleâ€”whether
it
be
one-third
or
one-fifth
or
one-tenth-
is
ill-fed
,
ill-clothed
,
ill
housed
,
and
insecure
.
