i
turn
to
a
subject
which
i
hope
can
be
handled
promptly
and
without
serious
controversy
of
any
kind
.
i
mean
the
method
of
selecting
nominee
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
state
.
i
feel
confident
that
i
do
not
misinterpret
the
wish
or
the
expectation
of
the
country
when
i
urge
the
prompt
enactment
of
legislation
which
will
provide
for
primary
election
throughout
the
country
at
which
the
voter
of
the
several
party
may
choose
their
nominee
for
the
presidency
without
the
intervention
of
nominating
convention
.
i
venture
the
suggestion
that
this
legislation
should
provide
for
the
retention
of
party
convention
,
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
declaring
and
accepting
the
verdict
of
the
primary
and
formulating
the
platform
of
the
party
;
and
i
suggest
that
these
convention
should
consist
not
of
delegate
chosen
for
this
single
purpose
,
but
of
the
nominee
for
congress
,
the
nominee
for
vacant
seat
in
the
senate
of
the
united
state
,
the
senator
whose
term
have
not
yet
closed
,
the
national
committee
,
and
the
candidate
for
the
presidency
themselves
,
in
order
that
platform
may
be
framed
by
those
responsible
to
the
people
for
carrying
them
into
effect
.
