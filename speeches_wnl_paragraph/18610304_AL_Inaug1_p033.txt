i
will
venture
to
add
that
to
me
the
convention
mode
seems
preferable
,
in
that
it
allows
amendment
to
originate
with
the
people
themselves
,
instead
of
only
permitting
them
to
take
or
reject
proposition
originated
by
others
not
especially
chosen
for
the
purpose
,
and
which
might
not
be
precisely
such
a
they
would
wish
to
either
accept
or
refuse
.
i
understand
a
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution—which
amendment
,
however
,
i
have
not
seen—has
passed
congress
,
to
the
effect
that
the
federal
government
shall
never
interfere
with
the
domestic
institution
of
the
state
,
including
that
of
person
held
to
service
.
to
avoid
misconstruction
of
what
i
have
said
,
i
depart
from
my
purpose
not
to
speak
of
particular
amendment
so
far
a
to
say
that
,
holding
such
a
provision
to
now
be
implied
constitutional
law
,
i
have
no
objection
to
it
being
made
express
and
irrevocable
.
