the
adoption
of
battalion
formation
for
infantry
regiment
,
the
strengthening
of
the
artillery
force
,
the
abandonment
of
smaller
and
unnecessary
post
,
and
the
massing
of
the
troop
at
important
and
accessible
station
all
promise
to
promote
the
usefulness
of
the
army
.
in
the
judgment
of
army
officer
,
with
but
few
exception
,
the
operation
of
the
law
forbidding
the
reenlistment
of
men
after
ten
year
'
service
ha
not
proved
it
wisdom
,
and
while
the
argument
that
led
to
it
adoption
were
not
without
merit
the
experience
of
the
year
constrains
me
to
join
in
the
recommendation
for
it
repeal
.
