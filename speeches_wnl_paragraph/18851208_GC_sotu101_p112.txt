the
fact
that
our
revenue
are
in
excess
of
the
actual
need
of
all
economical
administration
of
the
government
justifies
a
reduction
in
the
amount
exacted
from
the
people
for
it
support
.
our
government
is
but
the
mean
established
by
the
will
of
a
free
people
by
which
certain
principle
are
applied
which
they
have
adopted
for
their
benefit
and
protection
;
and
it
is
never
better
administered
and
it
true
spirit
is
never
better
observed
than
when
the
people
's
taxation
for
it
support
is
scrupulously
limited
to
the
actual
necessity
of
expenditure
and
distributed
according
to
a
just
and
equitable
plan
.
