it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
state
that
the
question
arising
from
our
relation
with
hawaii
have
caused
serious
embarrassment
.
just
prior
to
the
installation
of
the
present
administration
the
existing
government
of
hawaii
had
been
suddenly
overthrown
and
a
treaty
of
annexation
had
been
negotiated
between
the
provisional
government
of
the
island
and
the
united
state
and
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
.
this
treaty
i
withdrew
for
examination
and
dispatched
hon
.
james
h.
blount
,
of
georgia
,
to
honolulu
a
a
special
commissioner
to
make
an
impartial
investigation
of
the
circumstance
attending
the
change
of
government
and
of
all
the
condition
bearing
upon
the
subject
of
the
treaty
.
after
a
thorough
and
exhaustive
examination
mr.
blount
submitted
to
me
his
report
,
showing
beyond
all
question
that
the
constitutional
government
of
hawaii
had
been
subverted
with
the
active
aid
of
our
representative
to
that
government
and
through
the
intimidation
caused
by
the
presence
of
an
armed
naval
force
of
the
united
state
,
which
wa
landed
for
that
purpose
at
the
instance
of
our
minister
.
upon
the
fact
developed
it
seemed
to
me
the
only
honorable
course
for
our
government
to
pursue
wa
to
undo
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
by
those
representing
u
and
to
restore
a
far
a
practicable
the
status
existing
at
the
time
of
our
forcible
intervention
.
with
a
view
of
accomplishing
this
result
within
the
constitutional
limit
of
executive
power
,
and
recognizing
all
our
obligation
and
responsibility
growing
out
of
any
changed
condition
brought
about
by
our
unjustifiable
interference
,
our
present
minister
at
honolulu
ha
received
appropriate
instruction
to
that
end
.
thus
far
no
information
of
the
accomplishment
of
any
definite
result
ha
been
received
from
him
.
