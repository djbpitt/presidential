a
disloyal
portion
of
the
american
people
have
during
the
whole
year
been
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
divide
and
destroy
the
union
.
a
nation
which
endures
factious
domestic
division
is
exposed
to
disrespect
abroad
,
and
one
party
,
if
not
both
,
is
sure
sooner
or
later
to
invoke
foreign
intervention
.
