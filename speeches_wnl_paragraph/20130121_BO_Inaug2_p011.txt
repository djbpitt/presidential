but
we
have
always
understood
that
when
time
change
,
so
must
we
;
that
fidelity
to
our
founding
principle
requires
new
response
to
new
challenge
;
that
preserving
our
individual
freedom
ultimately
requires
collective
action
.
for
the
american
people
can
no
more
meet
the
demand
of
today
's
world
by
acting
alone
than
american
soldier
could
have
met
the
force
of
fascism
or
communism
with
musket
and
militia
.
no
single
person
can
train
all
the
math
and
science
teacher
we
'll
need
to
equip
our
child
for
the
future
,
or
build
the
road
and
network
and
research
lab
that
will
bring
new
job
and
business
to
our
shore
.
now
more
than
ever
,
we
must
do
these
thing
together
,
a
one
nation
and
one
people
.
