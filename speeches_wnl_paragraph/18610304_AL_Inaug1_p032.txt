this
country
,
with
it
institution
,
belongs
to
the
people
who
inhabit
it
.
whenever
they
shall
grow
weary
of
the
existing
government
,
they
can
exercise
their
constitutional
right
of
amending
it
,
or
their
revolutionary
right
to
dismember
or
overthrow
it
.
i
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
many
worthy
and
patriotic
citizen
are
desirous
of
having
the
national
constitution
amended
.
while
i
make
no
recommendation
of
amendment
,
i
fully
recognize
the
rightful
authority
of
the
people
over
the
whole
subject
,
to
be
exercised
in
either
of
the
mode
prescribed
in
the
instrument
itself
;
and
i
should
,
under
existing
circumstance
,
favor
rather
than
oppose
a
fair
opportunity
being
afforded
the
people
to
act
upon
it
.
