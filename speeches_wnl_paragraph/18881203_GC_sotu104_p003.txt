our
survival
for
one
hundred
year
is
not
sufficient
to
assure
u
that
we
no
longer
have
danger
to
fear
in
the
maintenance
,
with
all
it
promised
blessing
,
of
a
government
rounded
upon
the
freedom
of
the
people
.
the
time
rather
admonishes
u
to
soberly
inquire
whether
in
the
past
we
have
always
closely
kept
in
the
course
of
safety
,
and
whether
we
have
before
u
a
way
plain
and
clear
which
lead
to
happiness
and
perpetuity
.
