forty-four
american
have
now
taken
the
presidential
oath
.
the
word
have
been
spoken
during
rising
tide
of
prosperity
and
the
still
water
of
peace
.
yet
,
every
so
often
the
oath
is
taken
amidst
gathering
cloud
and
raging
storm
.
at
these
moment
,
america
ha
carried
on
not
simply
because
of
the
skill
or
vision
of
those
in
high
office
,
but
because
we
the
people
have
remained
faithful
to
the
ideal
of
our
forbearers
,
and
true
to
our
founding
document
.
