the
election
ha
exhibited
another
tact
not
le
valuable
to
be
known
--
the
fact
that
we
do
not
approach
exhaustion
in
the
most
important
branch
of
national
resource
,
that
of
living
men
.
while
it
is
melancholy
to
reflect
that
the
war
ha
filled
so
many
graf
and
carried
mourning
to
so
many
heart
,
it
is
some
relief
to
know
that
,
compared
with
the
surviving
,
the
fallen
have
been
so
few
.
while
corp
and
division
and
brigade
and
regiment
have
formed
and
fought
and
dwindled
and
gone
out
of
existence
,
a
great
majority
of
the
men
who
composed
them
are
still
living
.
the
same
is
true
of
the
naval
service
.
the

return
prove
this

so
many

could
not
else

showing
an
aggregate
now
of

to
this
is
to
be
added
33,762
cast
now
in
the
new
state
of
kansa
and
nevada
,
which
state
did
not
vote
in

,
thus
swelling
the
aggregate
to
4,015,773
and
the
net
increase
during
the
three
year

a
half
of
war
to
145,551
.
a
table
is
appended
showing
particular
.
to
this
again
should
be
added
the
number
of

from

who
by
the
law

not

,
and
which
number
can
not
be

than

nor
yet
is
this
all
.
the
number
in

is

,
while

white
and
black

press
back
the
insurgent
line
.
so
much
is
shown
,
affirmatively
and
negatively
,
by
the
election
.
it
is
not
material
to
inquire
how
the
increase
ha
been
produced
or
to
show
that
it
would
have
been
greater
but
for
the
war
,
which
is
probably
true
.
the
important
fact
remains
demonstrated
that
we
have
more
men
now
than
we
had
when
the
war
began
;
that
we
are
not
exhausted
nor
in

of

;
that

are
gaining

if
