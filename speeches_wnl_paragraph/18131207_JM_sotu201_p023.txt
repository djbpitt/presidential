the
view
of
the
french
government
on
the
subject
which
have
been
so
long
committed
to
negotiation
have
received
no
elucidation
since
the
close
of
your
late
session
.
the
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
state
at
paris
had
not
been
enabled
by
proper
opportunity
to
press
the
object
of
his
mission
a
prescribed
by
his
instruction
.
