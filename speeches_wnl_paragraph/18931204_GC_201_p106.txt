the
railway
mail
service
not
only
add
to
the
promptness
of
mail
delivery
at
all
office
,
but
it
is
the
especial
instrumentality
which
put
the
smaller
and
way
place
in
the
service
on
an
equality
in
that
regard
with
the
larger
and
terminal
office
.
this
branch
of
the
postal
service
ha
therefore
received
much
attention
from
the
postmaster-general
,
and
though
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
it
is
in
a
condition
of
high
efficiency
and
great
usefulness
,
i
am
led
to
agree
with
the
postmaster-general
that
there
is
room
for
it
further
improvement
.
