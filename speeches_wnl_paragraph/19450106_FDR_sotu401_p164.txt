the
provision
of
a
decent
home
for
every
family
is
a
national
necessity
,
if
this
country
is
to
be
worthy
of
it
greatnessâ€”and
that
task
will
itself
create
great
employment
opportunity
.
most
of
our
city
need
extensive
rebuilding
.
much
of
our
farm
plant
is
in
a
state
of
disrepair
.
to
make
a
frontal
attack
on
the
problem
of
housing
and
urban
reconstruction
will
require
thoroughgoing
cooperation
between
industry
and
labor
,
and
the
federal
,
state
,
and
local
government
.
