tonight
let
's
also
recognize
that
there
are
community
in
this
country
where
no
matter
how
hard
you
work
,
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
get
ahead
:
factory
town
decimated
from
year
of
plant
packing
up
;
inescapable
pocket
of
poverty
,
urban
and
rural
,
where
young
adult
are
still
fighting
for
their
first
job
.
america
is
not
a
place
where
the
chance
of
birth
or
circumstance
should
decide
our
destiny
.
and
that
's
why
we
need
to
build
new
ladder
of
opportunity
into
the
middle
class
for
all
who
are
willing
to
climb
them
.
