these
consideration
invite
the
united
state
to
look
to
the
mean
,
and
to
set
about
the
gradual
creation
of
a
navy
.
the
increasing
progress
of
their
navigation
promise
them
at
no
distant
period
the
requisite
supply
of
sea-men
,
and
their
mean
in
other
respect
favor
the
undertaking
.
it
is
an
encouragement
,
likewise
,
that
their
particular
situation
will
give
weight
and
influence
to
a
moderate
naval
force
in
their
hand
.
will
it
not
,
then
,
be
advisable
to
begin
without
delay
to
provide
and
lay
up
the
material
for
the
building
and
equipping
of
ship
of
war
,
and
to
proceed
in
the
work
by
degree
,
in
proportion
a
our
resource
shall
render
it
practicable
without
inconvenience
,
so
that
a
future
war
of
europe
may
not
find
our
commerce
in
the
same
unprotected
state
in
which
it
wa
found
by
the
present
?
