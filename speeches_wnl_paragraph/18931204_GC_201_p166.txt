at
this
time
,
when
a
depleted
public
treasury
confronts
u
,
when
many
of
our
people
are
engaged
in
a
hard
struggle
for
the
necessary
of
life
,
and
when
enforced
economy
is
pressing
upon
the
great
mass
of
our
countryman
,
i
desire
to
urge
with
all
the
earnestness
at
my
command
that
congressional
legislation
be
so
limited
by
strict
economy
a
to
exhibit
an
appreciation
of
the
condition
of
the
treasury
and
a
sympathy
with
the
straitened
circumstance
of
our
fellow-citizens
.
