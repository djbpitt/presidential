now
,
one
place
to
start
is
serious
financial
reform
.
look
,
i
am
not
interested
in
punishing
bank
.
i
'm
interested
in
protecting
our
economy
.
a
strong
,
healthy
financial
market
make
it
possible
for
business
to
access
credit
and
create
new
job
.
it
channel
the
saving
of
family
into
investment
that
raise
income
.
but
that
can
only
happen
if
we
guard
against
the
same
recklessness
that
nearly
brought
down
our
entire
economy
.
