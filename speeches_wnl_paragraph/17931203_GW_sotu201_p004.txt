in
this
posture
of
affair
,
both
new
and
delicate
,
i
resolved
to
adopt
general
rule
which
should
conform
to
the
treaty
and
assert
the
privilege
of
the
united
state
.
these
were
reduced
into
a
system
,
which
will
be
communicated
to
you
.
although
i
have
not
thought
of
myself
at
liberty
to
forbid
the
sale
of
the
prize
permitted
by
our
treaty
of
commerce
with
france
to
be
brought
into
our
port
,
i
have
not
refused
to
cause
them
to
be
restored
when
they
were
taken
within
the
protection
of
our
territory
,
or
by
vessel
commissioned
or
equipped
in
a
warlike
form
within
the
limit
of
the
united
state
.
