i
earnestly
urge
that
congress
recast
the
appropriation
for
the
maintenance
of
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
on
a
footing
commensurate
with
the
importance
of
our
national
interest
.
at
every
post
where
a
representative
is
necessary
the
salary
should
be
so
graded
a
to
permit
him
to
live
with
comfort
.
with
the
assignment
of
adequate
salary
the
so-called
notarial
extra
official
fee
,
which
our
officer
abroad
are
now
permitted
to
treat
a
personal
perquisite
,
should
be
done
away
with
.
every
act
requiring
the
certification
and
seal
of
the
officer
should
be
taxable
at
schedule
rate
and
the
fee
therefor
returned
to
the
treasury
.
by
restoring
these
revenue
to
the
public
use
the
consular
service
would
be
self-supporting
,
even
with
a
liberal
increase
of
the
present
low
salary
.
