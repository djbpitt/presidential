so
it
is
with
america
.
each
time
i
look
at
that
flag
,
i
'm
reminded
that
our
destiny
is
stitched
together
like
those
50
star
and
those
13
stripe
.
no
one
built
this
country
on
their
own
.
this
nation
is
great
because
we
built
it
together
.
this
nation
is
great
because
we
worked
a
a
team
.
this
nation
is
great
because
we
get
each
other
's
back
.
and
if
we
hold
fast
to
that
truth
,
in
this
moment
of
trial
,
there
is
no
challenge
too
great
,
no
mission
too
hard
.
a
long
a
we
are
joined
in
common
purpose
,
a
long
a
we
maintain
our
common
resolve
,
our
journey
move
forward
,
and
our
future
is
hopeful
,
and
the
state
of
our
union
will
always
be
strong
.
