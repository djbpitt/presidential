the
canal
company
ha
unfortunately
become
financially
seriously
embarrassed
,
but
a
generous
treatment
had
been
extended
to
it
by
the
government
of
nicaragua
.
the
united
state
are
especially
interested
in
the
successful
achievement
of
the
vast
undertaking
this
company
ha
in
charge
.
that
it
should
be
accomplished
under
distinctively
american
auspex
,
and
it
enjoyment
assured
not
only
to
the
vessel
of
this
country
a
a
channel
of
communication
between
our
atlantic
and
pacific
sea-boards
,
but
to
the
ship
of
the
world
in
the
interest
of
civilization
,
is
a
proposition
which
,
in
my
judgment
,
doe
not
admit
of
question
.
