unquestionably
if
we
are
content
with
the
maintenance
of
a
navy
department
simply
a
a
shabby
ornament
to
the
government
,
a
constant
watchfulness
may
prevent
some
of
the
scandal
and
abuse
which
have
found
their
way
into
our
present
organization
,
and
it
incurable
waste
may
be
reduced
to
the
minimum
.
but
if
we
desire
to
build
ship
for
present
usefulness
instead
of
naval
reminder
of
the
day
that
are
past
,
we
must
have
a
department
organized
for
the
work
,
supplied
with
all
the
talent
and
ingenuity
our
country
affords
,
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
the
experience
of
other
nation
,
systematized
so
that
all
effort
shall
unite
and
lead
in
one
direction
,
and
fully
imbued
with
the
conviction
that
war
vessel
,
though
new
,
are
useless
unless
they
combine
all
that
the
ingenuity
of
man
ha
up
to
this
day
brought
forth
relating
to
their
construction
.
