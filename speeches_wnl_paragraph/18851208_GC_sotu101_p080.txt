while
recognizing
the
right
of
expatriation
,
no
statutory
provision
exists
providing
mean
for
renouncing
citizenship
by
an
american
citizen
,
native
born
or
naturalized
,
nor
for
terminating
and
vacating
an
improper
acquisition
of
citizenship
.
even
a
fraudulent
decree
of
naturalization
can
not
now
be
canceled
.
the
privilege
and
franchise
of
american
citizenship
should
be
granted
with
care
,
and
extended
to
those
only
who
intend
in
good
faith
to
assume
it
duty
and
responsibility
when
attaining
it
privilege
and
benefit
.
it
should
be
withheld
from
those
who
merely
go
through
the
form
of
naturalization
with
the
intent
of
escaping
the
duty
of
their
original
allegiance
without
taking
upon
themselves
those
of
their
new
status
,
or
who
may
acquire
the
right
of
american
citizenship
for
no
other
than
a
hostile
purpose
toward
their
original
government
.
these
evil
have
had
many
flagrant
illustration
.
