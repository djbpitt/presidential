in
2011
,
congress
passed
a
law
saying
that
if
both
party
could
n't
agree
on
a
plan
to
reach
our
deficit
goal
,
about
a
trillion
dollar
'
worth
of
budget
cut
would
automatically
go
into
effect
this
year
.
these
sudden
,
harsh
,
arbitrary
cut
would
jeopardize
our
military
readiness
.
they
'd
devastate
priority
like
education
and
energy
and
medical
research
.
they
would
certainly
slow
our
recovery
and
cost
u
hundred
of
thousand
of
job
.
and
that
's
why
democrat
,
republican
,
business
leader
,
and
economist
have
already
said
that
these
cuts—known
here
in
washington
a
the
sequester—are
a
really
bad
idea
.
