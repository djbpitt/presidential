i
realize
that
i
have
emphasized
to
you
the
gravity
of
the
situation
which
confronts
the
people
of
the
world
.
this
emphasis
is
justified
because
of
it
importance
to
civilization
and
therefore
to
the
united
state
.
peace
is
jeopardized
by
the
few
and
not
by
the
many
.
peace
is
threatened
by
those
who
seek
selfish
power
.
the
world
ha
witnessed
similar
erasâ€”
a
in
the
day
when
petty
king
and
feudal
baron
were
changing
the
map
of
europe
every
fortnight
,
or
when
great
emperor
and
great
king
were
engaged
in
a
mad
scramble
for
colonial
empire
.
we
hope
that
we
are
not
again
at
the
threshold
of
such
an
era
.
but
if
face
it
we
must
,
then
the
united
state
and
the
rest
of
the
america
can
play
but
one
role
:
through
a
well-ordered
neutrality
to
do
naught
to
encourage
the
contest
,
through
adequate
defense
to
save
ourselves
from
embroilment
and
attack
,
and
through
example
and
all
legitimate
encouragement
and
assistance
to
persuade
other
nation
to
return
to
the
way
of
peace
and
good-will
.
