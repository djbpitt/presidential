the
wrong
,
the
very
deep
wrong
,
committed
in
this
war
will
have
to
be
righted
.
that
of
course
.
but
they
can
not
and
must
not
be
righted
by
the
commission
of
similar
wrong
against
germany
and
her
ally
.
the
world
will
not
permit
the
commission
of
similar
wrong
a
a
mean
of
reparation
and
settlement
.
statesman
must
by
this
time
have
learned
that
the
opinion
of
the
world
is
everywhere
wide
awake
and
fully
comprehends
the
issue
involved
.
no
representative
of
any
self-governed
nation
will
dare
disregard
it
by
attempting
any
such
covenant
of
selfishness
and
compromise
a
were
entered
into
at
the
congress
of
vienna
.
the
thought
of
the
plain
people
here
and
everywhere
throughout
the
world
,
the
people
who
enjoy
no
privilege
and
have
very
simple
and
unsophisticated
standard
of
right
and
wrong
,
is
the
air
all
government
must
henceforth
breathe
if
they
would
live
.
it
is
in
the
full
disclosing
light
of
that
thought
that
all
policy
must
be
conceived
and
executed
in
this
midday
hour
of
the
world
's
life
.
german
ruler
have
been
able
to
upset
the
peace
of
the
world
only
because
the
german
people
were
not
suffered
under
their
tutelage
to
share
the
comradeship
of
the
other
people
of
the
world
either
in
thought
or
in
purpose
.
they
were
allowed
to
have
no
opinion
of
their
own
which
might
be
set
up
a
a
rule
of
conduct
for
those
who
exercised
authority
over
them
.
but
the
congress
that
concludes
this
war
will
feel
the
full
strength
of
the
tide
that
run
now
in
the
heart
and
conscience
of
free
men
everywhere
.
it
conclusion
will
run
with
those
tide
.
