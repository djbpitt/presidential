the
condition
of
affair
among
the
five
civilized
tribe
,
who
occupy
large
tract
of
land
in
the
indian
territory
and
who
have
government
of
their
own
,
ha
assumed
such
an
aspect
a
to
render
it
almost
indispensable
that
there
should
be
an
entire
change
in
the
relation
of
these
indian
to
the
general
government
.
this
seems
to
be
necessary
in
furtherance
of
their
own
interest
,
a
well
a
for
the
protection
of
non-indian
resident
in
their
territory
.
a
commission
organized
and
empowered
under
several
recent
law
is
now
negotiating
with
these
indian
for
the
relinquishment
of
their
court
and
the
division
of
their
common
land
in
severalty
and
are
aiding
in
the
settlement
of
the
troublesome
question
of
tribal
membership
.
the
reception
of
their
first
proffer
of
negotiation
wa
not
encouraging
,
but
through
patience
and
such
conduct
on
their
part
a
demonstrated
that
their
intention
were
friendly
and
in
the
interest
of
the
tribe
the
prospect
of
success
ha
become
more
promising
.
the
effort
should
be
to
save
these
indian
from
the
consequence
of
their
own
mistake
and
improvidence
and
to
secure
to
the
real
indian
his
right
a
against
intruder
and
professed
friend
who
profit
by
his
retrogression
.
a
change
is
also
needed
to
protect
life
and
property
through
the
operation
of
court
conducted
according
to
strict
justice
and
strong
enough
to
enforce
their
mandate
.
