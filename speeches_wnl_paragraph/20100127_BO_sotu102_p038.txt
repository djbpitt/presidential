third
,
we
need
to
export
more
of
our
good
,
because
the
more
product
we
make
and
sell
to
other
country
,
the
more
job
we
support
right
here
in
america
.
so
tonight
we
set
a
new
goal
:
we
will
double
our
export
over
the
next
5
year
,
an
increase
that
will
support
2
million
job
in
america
.
to
help
meet
this
goal
,
we
're
launching
a
national
export
initiative
that
will
help
farmer
and
small
business
increase
their
export
and
reform
export
control
consistent
with
national
security
.
