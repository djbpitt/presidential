the
operation
of
the
treasury
during
the
period
which
ha
elapsed
since
your
adjournment
have
been
conducted
with
signal
success
.
the
patriotism
of
the
people
ha
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
the
large
mean
demanded
by
the
public
exigency
.
much
of
the
national
loan
ha
been
taken
by
citizen
of
the
industrial
class
,
whose
confidence
in
their
country
's
faith
and
zeal
for
their
country
's
deliverance
from
present
peril
have
induced
them
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
the
government
the
whole
of
their
limited
acquisition
.
this
fact
imposes
peculiar
obligation
to
economy
in
disbursement
and
energy
in
action
.
