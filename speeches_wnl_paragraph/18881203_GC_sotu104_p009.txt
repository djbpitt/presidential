we
discover
that
the
fortune
realized
by
our
manufacturer
are
no
longer
solely
the
reward
of
sturdy
industry
and
enlightened
foresight
,
but
that
they
result
from
the
discriminating
favor
of
the
government
and
are
largely
built
upon
undue
exaction
from
the
mass
of
our
people
.
the
gulf
between
employer
and
the
employed
is
constantly
widening
,
and
class
are
rapidly
forming
,
one
comprising
the
very
rich
and
powerful
,
while
in
another
are
found
the
toiling
poor
.
