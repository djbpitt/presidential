the
situation
wa
such
in
december
last
,
seven
month
before
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
,
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
foretold
a
deficiency
of
$
17,000,000
.
the
great
and
increasing
apprehension
and
timidity
in
business
circle
and
the
depression
in
all
activity
intervening
since
that
time
,
resulting
from
cause
perfectly
well
understood
and
entirely
disconnected
with
our
tariff
law
or
it
operation
,
seriously
checked
the
import
we
would
have
otherwise
received
and
readily
account
for
the
difference
between
this
estimate
of
the
secretary
and
the
actual
deficiency
,
a
well
a
for
a
continued
deficit
.
indeed
,
it
must
be
confessed
that
we
could
hardly
have
had
a
more
unfavorable
period
than
the
last
two
year
for
the
collection
of
tariff
revenue
.
we
can
not
reasonably
hope
that
our
recuperation
from
this
business
depression
will
be
sudden
,
but
it
ha
already
set
in
with
a
promise
of
acceleration
and
continuance
.
