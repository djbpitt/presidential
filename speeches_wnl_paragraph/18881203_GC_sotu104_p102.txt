our
law
regulating
the
issue
of
passport
should
be
carefully
revised
,
and
the
institution
of
a
central
bureau
of
registration
at
the
capital
is
again
strongly
recommended
.
by
this
mean
full
particular
of
each
case
of
naturalization
in
the
united
state
would
be
secured
and
properly
indexed
and
recorded
,
and
thus
many
case
of
spurious
citizenship
would
be
detected
and
unjust
responsibility
would
be
avoided
.
