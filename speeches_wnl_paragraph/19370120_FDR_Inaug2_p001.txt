when
four
year
ago
we
met
to
inaugurate
president
,
the
republic
,
single-minded
in
anxiety
,
stood
in
spirit
here
.
we
dedicated
ourselves
to
the
fulfillment
of
a
visionâ€”to
speed
the
time
when
there
would
be
for
all
the
people
that
security
and
peace
essential
to
the
pursuit
of
happiness
.
we
of
the
republic
pledged
ourselves
to
drive
from
the
temple
of
our
ancient
faith
those
who
had
profaned
it
;
to
end
by
action
,
tireless
and
unafraid
,
the
stagnation
and
despair
of
that
day
.
we
did
those
first
thing
first
.
