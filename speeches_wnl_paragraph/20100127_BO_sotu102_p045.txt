now
,
let
's
clear
a
few
thing
up
.
i
did
n't
choose
to
tackle
this
issue
to
get
some
legislative
victory
under
my
belt
.
and
by
now
it
should
be
fairly
obvious
that
i
didn't
take
on
health
care
because
it
wa
good
politics
.
i
took
on
health
care
because
of
the
story
i
've
heard
from
american
with
preexisting
condition
whose
life
depend
on
getting
coverage
,
patient
who
've
been
denied
coverage
,
family
,
even
those
with
insurance
,
who
are
just
one
illness
away
from
financial
ruin
.
