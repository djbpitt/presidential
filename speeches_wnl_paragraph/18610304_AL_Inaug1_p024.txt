all
profess
to
be
content
in
the
union
if
all
constitutional
right
can
be
maintained
.
is
it
true
,
then
,
that
any
right
,
plainly
written
in
the
constitution
,
ha
been
denied
?
i
think
not
.
happily
the
human
mind
is
so
constituted
that
no
party
can
reach
to
the
audacity
of
doing
this
.
think
,
if
you
can
,
of
a
single
instance
in
which
a
plainly
written
provision
of
the
constitution
ha
ever
been
denied
.
if
by
the
mere
force
of
number
a
majority
should
deprive
a
minority
of
any
clearly
written
constitutional
right
,
it
might
,
in
a
moral
point
of
view
,
justify
revolutionâ€”certainly
would
if
such
a
right
were
a
vital
one
.
but
such
is
not
our
case
.
all
the
vital
right
of
minority
and
of
individual
are
so
plainly
assured
to
them
by
affirmation
and
negation
,
guarantee
and
prohibition
,
in
the
constitution
,
that
controversy
never
arise
concerning
them
.
but
no
organic
law
can
ever
be
framed
with
a
provision
specifically
applicable
to
every
question
which
may
occur
in
practical
administration
.
no
foresight
can
anticipate
,
nor
any
document
of
reasonable
length
contain
,
express
provision
for
all
possible
question
.
shall
fugitive
from
labor
be
surrendered
by
national
or
by
state
authority
?
the
constitution
doe
not
expressly
say
.
may
congress
prohibit
slavery
in
the
territory
?
