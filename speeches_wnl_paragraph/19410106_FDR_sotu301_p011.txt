we
need
not
overemphasize
imperfection
in
the
peace
of
versailles
.
we
need
not
harp
on
failure
of
the
democracy
to
deal
with
problem
of
world
reconstruction
.
we
should
remember
that
the
peace
of
1919
wa
far
le
unjust
than
the
kind
of
``
pacification
''
which
began
even
before
munich
,
and
which
is
being
carried
on
under
the
new
order
of
tyranny
that
seek
to
spread
over
every
continent
today
.
the
american
people
have
unalterably
set
their
face
against
that
tyranny
.
