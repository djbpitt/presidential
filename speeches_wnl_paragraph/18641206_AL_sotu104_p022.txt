in
view
of
the
insecurity
of
life
and
property
in
the
region
adjacent
to
the
canadian
border
,
by
reason
of
recent
assault
and
depredation
committed
by
inimical
and
desperate
person
who
are
harbored
there
,
it
ha
been
thought
proper
to
give
notice
that
after
the
expiration
of
six
month
,
the
period
conditionally
stipulated
in
the
existing
arrangement
with
great
britain
,
the
united
state
must
hold
themselves
at
liberty
to
increase
their
naval
armament
upon
the
lake
if
they
shall
find
that
proceeding
necessary
.
the
condition
of
the
border
will
necessarily
come
into
consideration
in
connection
with
the
question
of
continuing
or
modifying
the
right
of
transit
from
canada
through
the
united
state
,
a
well
a
the
regulation
of
impost
,
which
were
temporarily
established
by
the
reciprocity
treaty
of
the
5th
june
,
1854
.
