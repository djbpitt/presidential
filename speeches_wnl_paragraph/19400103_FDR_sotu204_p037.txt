it
is
not
correct
to
infer
that
legislative
power
have
been
transferred
from
the
congress
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
.
everyone
recognizes
that
general
tariff
legislation
is
a
congressional
function
;
but
we
know
that
,
because
of
the
stupendous
task
involved
in
the
fashioning
and
the
passing
of
a
general
tariff
law
,
it
is
advisable
to
provide
at
time
of
emergency
some
flexibility
to
make
the
general
law
adjustable
to
quickly
changing
condition
.
