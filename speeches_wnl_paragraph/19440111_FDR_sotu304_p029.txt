and
i
hope
you
will
remember
that
all
of
u
in
this
government
represent
the
fixed
income
group
just
a
much
a
we
represent
business
owner
,
worker
,
and
farmer
.
this
group
of
fixed
income
people
includes
:
teacher
,
clergy
,
policeman
,
fireman
,
widow
and
minor
on
fixed
income
,
wife
and
dependent
of
our
soldier
and
sailor
,
and
old-age
pensioner
.
they
and
their
family
add
up
to
one-quarter
of
our
one
hundred
and
thirty
million
people
.
they
have
few
or
no
high
pressure
representative
at
the
capitol
.
in
a
period
of
gross
inflation
they
would
be
the
worst
sufferer
.
