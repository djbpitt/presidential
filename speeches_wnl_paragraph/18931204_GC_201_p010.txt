it
is
believed
that
under
the
recent
amendment
of
the
act
extending
the
time
for
registration
the
chinese
laborer
thereto
entitled
who
desire
to
reside
in
this
country
will
now
avail
themselves
of
the
renewed
privilege
thus
afforded
of
establishing
by
lawful
procedure
their
right
to
remain
,
and
that
thereby
the
necessity
of
enforced
deportation
may
to
a
great
degree
be
avoided
.
