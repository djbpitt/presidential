in
such
a
spirit
on
my
part
and
on
yours
we
face
our
common
difficulty
.
they
concern
,
thank
god
,
only
material
thing
.
value
have
shrunken
to
fantastic
level
;
tax
have
risen
;
our
ability
to
pay
ha
fallen
;
government
of
all
kind
is
faced
by
serious
curtailment
of
income
;
the
mean
of
exchange
are
frozen
in
the
current
of
trade
;
the
withered
leaf
of
industrial
enterprise
lie
on
every
side
;
farmer
find
no
market
for
their
produce
;
the
saving
of
many
year
in
thousand
of
family
are
gone
.
