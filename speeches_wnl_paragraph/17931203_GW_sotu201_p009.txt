can
not
recommend
to
your
notice
measure
for
the
fulfillment
of
our
duty
to
the
rest
of
the
world
without
again
pressing
upon
you
the
necessity
of
placing
ourselves
in
a
condition
of
complete
defense
and
of
exacting
from
them
the
fulfillment
of
their
duty
toward
u
.
the
united
state
ought
not
to
indulge
a
persuasion
that
,
contrary
to
the
order
of
human
event
,
they
will
forever
keep
at
a
distance
those
painful
appeal
to
arm
with
which
the
history
of
every
other
nation
abounds
.
there
is
a
rank
due
to
the
united
state
among
nation
which
will
be
withheld
,
if
not
absolutely
lost
,
by
the
reputation
of
weakness
.
if
we
desire
to
avoid
insult
,
we
must
be
able
to
repel
it
;
if
we
desire
to
secure
peace
,
one
of
the
most
powerful
instrument
of
our
rising
prosperity
,
it
must
be
known
that
we
are
at
all
time
ready
for
war
.
the
document
which
will
be
presented
to
you
will
shew
the
amount
and
kind
of
arm
and
military
store
now
in
our
magazine
and
arsenal
;
and
yet
an
addition
even
to
these
supply
can
not
with
prudence
be
neglected
,
a
it
would
leave
nothing
to
the
uncertainty
of
procuring
warlike
apparatus
in
the
moment
of
public
danger
.
