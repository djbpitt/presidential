already
,
the
affordable
care
act
is
helping
to
slow
the
growth
of
health
care
cost
.
and
the
reform
i
'm
proposing
go
even
further
.
we
'll
reduce
taxpayer
subsidy
to
prescription
drug
company
and
ask
more
from
the
wealthiest
senior
.
we
'll
bring
down
cost
by
changing
the
way
our
government
pay
for
medicare
,
because
our
medical
bill
should
n't
be
based
on
the
number
of
test
ordered
or
day
spent
in
the
hospital
;
they
should
be
based
on
the
quality
of
care
that
our
senior
receive
.
and
i
am
open
to
additional
reform
from
both
party
,
so
long
a
they
do
n't
violate
the
guarantee
of
a
secure
retirement
.
our
government
should
n't
make
promise
we
can
not
keep
,
but
we
must
keep
the
promise
we
've
already
made
.
