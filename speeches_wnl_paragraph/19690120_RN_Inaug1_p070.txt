the
peace
we
seek
to
win
is
not
victory
over
any
other
people
,
but
the
peace
that
come
``
with
healing
in
it
wing
''
;
with
compassion
for
those
who
have
suffered
;
with
understanding
for
those
who
have
opposed
u
;
with
the
opportunity
for
all
the
people
of
this
earth
to
choose
their
own
destiny
.
