in
the
continuing
progress
of
this
war
we
have
constant
need
for
new
type
of
weapon
,
for
we
can
not
afford
to
fight
the
war
of
today
or
tomorrow
with
the
weapon
of
yesterday
.
for
example
,
the
american
army
now
ha
developed
a
new
tank
with
a
gun
more
powerful
than
any
yet
mounted
on
a
fast-moving
vehicle
.
the
army
will
need
many
thousand
of
these
new
tank
in
1945
.
