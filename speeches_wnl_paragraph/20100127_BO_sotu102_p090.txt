but
i
also
know
this
:
if
people
had
made
that
decision
50
year
ago
or
100
year
ago
or
200
year
ago
,
we
would
n't
be
here
tonight
.
the
only
reason
we
are
here
is
because
generation
of
american
were
unafraid
to
do
what
wa
hard
,
to
do
what
wa
needed
even
when
success
wa
uncertain
,
to
do
what
it
took
to
keep
the
dream
of
this
nation
alive
for
their
child
and
their
grandchild
.
