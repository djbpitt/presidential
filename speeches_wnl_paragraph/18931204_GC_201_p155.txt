in
each
state
and
territory
an
agricultural
experiment
station
ha
been
established
.
these
station
,
by
their
very
character
and
name
,
are
the
proper
agency
to
experiment
with
and
test
new
variety
of
seed
;
and
yet
this
indiscriminate
and
wasteful
distribution
by
legislation
and
legislator
continues
,
answering
no
purpose
unless
it
be
to
remind
constituent
that
their
representative
are
willing
to
remember
them
with
gratuity
at
public
cost
.
