permit
me
to
emphasize
once
more
the
need
for
action
upon
certain
matter
upon
which
i
dwelt
at
some
length
in
my
message
to
the
second
session
of
the
sixty-sixth
congress
.
the
necessity
,
for
example
,
of
encouraging
the
manufacture
of
dyestuff
and
related
chemical
;
the
importance
of
doing
everything
possible
to
promote
agricultural
production
along
economic
line
,
to
improve
agricultural
marketing
,
and
to
make
rural
life
more
attractive
and
healthful
;
the
need
for
a
law
regulating
cold
storage
in
such
a
way
a
to
limit
the
time
during
which
good
may
be
kept
in
storage
,
prescribing
the
method
of
disposing
of
them
if
kept
beyond
the
permitted
period
,
and
requiring
good
released
from
storage
in
all
case
to
bear
the
date
of
their
receipt
.
it
would
also
be
most
serviceable
if
it
were
provided
that
all
good
released
from
cold
storage
for
interstate
shipment
should
have
plainly
marked
upon
each
package
the
selling
or
market
price
at
which
they
went
into
storage
,
in
order
that
the
purchaser
might
be
able
to
learn
what
profit
stood
between
him
and
the
producer
or
the
wholesale
dealer
.
indeed
,
it
would
be
very
serviceable
to
the
public
if
all
good
destined
for
interstate
commerce
were
made
to
carry
upon
every
packing
case
whose
form
made
it
possible
a
plain
statement
of
the
price
at
which
they
left
the
hand
of
the
producer
.
i
respectfully
call
your
attention
also
to
the
recommendation
of
the
message
referred
to
with
regard
to
a
federal
license
for
all
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
.
