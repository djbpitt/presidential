let
there
be
no
misunderstanding
.
our
present
and
immediate
task
is
to
win
the
war
,
and
nothing
shall
turn
u
aside
from
it
until
it
is
accomplished
.
every
power
and
resource
we
posse
,
whether
of
men
,
of
money
,
or
of
material
,
is
being
devoted
and
will
continue
to
be
devoted
to
that
purpose
until
it
is
achieved
.
those
who
desire
to
bring
peace
about
before
that
purpose
is
achieved
i
counsel
to
carry
their
advice
elsewhere
.
we
will
not
entertain
it
.
we
shall
regard
the
war
a
won
only
when
the
german
people
say
to
u
,
through
properly
accredited
representative
,
that
they
are
ready
to
agree
to
a
settlement
based
upon
justice
and
the
reparation
of
the
wrong
their
ruler
have
done
.
they
have
done
a
wrong
to
belgium
which
must
be
repaired
.
they
have
established
a
power
over
other
land
and
people
than
their
own
--
over
the
great
empire
of
austria-hungary
,
over
hitherto
free
balkan
state
,
over
turkey
,
and
within
asia
--
which
must
be
relinquished
.
