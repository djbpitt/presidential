the
argentine
government
ha
revived
the
long
dormant
question
of
the
falkland
island
by
claiming
from
the
united
state
indemnity
for
their
loss
,
attributed
to
the
action
of
the
commander
of
the
sloop
of
war
lexington
in
breaking
up
a
piratical
colony
on
those
island
in
1831
,
and
their
subsequent
occupation
by
great
britain
.
in
view
of
the
ample
justification
for
the
act
of
the
lexington
and
the
derelict
condition
of
the
island
before
and
after
their
alleged
occupation
by
argentine
colonist
,
this
government
considers
the
claim
a
wholly
groundless
.
