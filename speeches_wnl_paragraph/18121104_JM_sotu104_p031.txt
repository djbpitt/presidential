the
situation
of
our
country
,
fellow
citizen
,
is
not
without
it
difficulty
,
though
it
abounds
in
animating
consideration
,
of
which
the
view
here
presented
of
our
pecuniary
resource
is
an
example
.
with
more
than
one
nation
we
have
serious
and
unsettled
controversy
,
and
with
one
,
powerful
in
the
mean
and
habit
of
war
,
we
are
at
war
.
the
spirit
and
strength
of
the
nation
are
nevertheless
equal
to
the
support
of
all
it
right
,
and
to
carry
it
through
all
it
trial
.
they
can
be
met
in
that
confidence
.
