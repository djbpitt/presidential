question
ha
arisen
with
the
government
of
austria-hungary
touching
the
representation
of
the
united
state
at
vienna
.
having
under
my
constitutional
prerogative
appointed
an
estimable
citizen
of
unimpeached
probity
and
competence
a
minister
at
that
court
,
the
government
of
austria-hungary
invited
this
government
to
take
cognizance
of
certain
exception
,
based
upon
allegation
against
the
personal
acceptability
of
mr.
keiley
,
the
appointed
envoy
,
asking
that
in
view
thereof
the
appointment
should
be
withdrawn
.
the
reason
advanced
were
such
a
could
not
be
acquiesced
in
without
violation
of
my
oath
of
office
and
the
precept
of
the
constitution
,
since
they
necessarily
involved
a
limitation
in
favor
of
a
foreign
government
upon
the
right
of
selection
by
the
executive
and
required
such
an
application
of
a
religious
test
a
a
qualification
for
office
under
the
united
state
a
would
have
resulted
in
the
practical
disfranchisement
of
a
large
class
of
our
citizen
and
the
abandonment
of
a
vital
principle
in
our
government
.
the
austro-hungarian
government
finally
decided
not
to
receive
mr.
keiley
a
the
envoy
of
the
united
state
,
and
that
gentleman
ha
since
resigned
his
commission
,
leaving
the
post
vacant
.
i
have
made
no
new
nomination
,
and
the
interest
of
this
government
at
vienna
are
now
in
the
care
of
the
secretary
of
legation
,
acting
a
charge
'
d'affaires
ad
interim
.
