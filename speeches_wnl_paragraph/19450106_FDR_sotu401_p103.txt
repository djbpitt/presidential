,
the
recognition
by
law
of
the
duty
of
every
citizen
to
do
his
or
her
part
in
winning
the
war
,
will
give
complete
assurance
that
the
need
for
war
equipment
will
be
filled
.
in
the
coming
year
we
must
increase
the
output
of
many
weapon
and
supply
on
short
notice
.
otherwise
we
shall
not
keep
our
production
abreast
of
the
swiftly
changing
need
of
war
.
at
the
same
time
it
will
be
necessary
to
draw
progressively
many
men
now
engaged
in
war
production
to
serve
with
the
armed
force
,
and
their
place
in
war
production
must
be
filled
promptly
.
these
development
will
require
the
addition
of
hundred
of
thousand
to
those
already
working
in
war
industry
.
we
do
not
believe
that
these
need
can
be
met
effectively
under
present
method
.
