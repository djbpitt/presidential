nor
should
our
vast
tract
of
so-called
desert
land
be
yielded
up
to
the
monopoly
of
corporation
or
grasping
individual
,
a
appears
to
be
much
the
tendency
under
the
existing
statute
.
these
land
require
but
the
supply
of
water
to
become
fertile
and
productive
.
it
is
a
problem
of
great
moment
how
most
wisely
for
the
public
good
that
factor
shall
be
furnished
.
i
can
not
but
think
it
perilous
to
suffer
either
these
land
or
the
source
of
their
irrigation
to
fall
into
the
hand
of
monopoly
,
which
by
such
mean
may
exercise
lordship
over
the
area
dependent
on
their
treatment
for
productiveness
.
already
step
have
been
taken
to
secure
accurate
and
scientific
information
of
the
condition
,
which
is
the
prime
basis
of
intelligent
action
.
until
this
shall
be
gained
the
course
of
wisdom
appears
clearly
to
lie
in
a
suspension
of
further
disposal
,
which
only
promise
to
create
right
antagonistic
to
the
common
interest
.
no
harm
can
follow
this
cautionary
conduct
.
the
land
will
remain
,
and
the
public
good
present
no
demand
for
hasty
dispossession
of
national
ownership
and
control
.
