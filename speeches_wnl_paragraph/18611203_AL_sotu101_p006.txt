the
disloyal
citizen
of
the
united
state
who
have
offered
the
ruin
of
our
country
in
return
for
the
aid
and
comfort
which
they
have
invoked
abroad
have
received
le
patronage
and
encouragement
than
they
probably
expected
.
if
it
were
just
to
suppose
,
a
the
insurgent
have
seemed
to
assume
,
that
foreign
nation
in
this
case
,
discarding
all
moral
,
social
,
and
treaty
obligation
,
would
act
solely
and
selfishly
for
the
most
speedy
restoration
of
commerce
,
including
especially
the
acquisition
of
cotton
,
those
nation
appear
a
yet
not
to
have
seen
their
way
to
their
object
more
directly
or
clearly
through
the
destruction
than
through
the
preservation
of
the
union
.
if
we
could
dare
to
believe
that
foreign
nation
are
actuated
by
no
higher
principle
than
this
,
i
am
quite
sure
a
sound
argument
could
be
made
to
show
them
that
they
can
reach
their
aim
more
readily
and
easily
by
aiding
to
crush
this
rebellion
than
by
giving
encouragement
to
it
.
