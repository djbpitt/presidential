no
,
we
will
not
go
back
to
an
economy
weakened
by
outsourcing
,
bad
debt
,
and
phony
financial
profit
.
tonight
i
want
to
speak
about
how
we
move
forward
and
lay
out
a
blueprint
for
an
economy
that
's
built
to
last
,
an
economy
built
on
american
manufacturing
,
american
energy
,
skill
for
american
worker
,
and
a
renewal
of
american
value
.
