we
'll
also
establish
a
financial
crime
unit
of
highly
trained
investigator
to
crack
down
on
large-scale
fraud
and
protect
people
's
investment
.
some
financial
firm
violate
major
antifraud
law
because
there
's
no
real
penalty
for
being
a
repeat
offender
.
that's
bad
for
consumer
,
and
it
's
bad
for
the
vast
majority
of
banker
and
financial
service
professional
who
do
the
right
thing
.
so
pas
legislation
that
make
the
penalty
for
fraud
count
.
