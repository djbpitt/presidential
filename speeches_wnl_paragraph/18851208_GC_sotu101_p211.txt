our
indian
population
,
exclusive
of
those
in
alaska
,
is
reported
a
numbering
260,000
,
nearly
all
being
located
on
land
set
apart
for
their
use
and
occupation
,
aggregating
over
134,000,000
acre
.
these
land
are
included
in
the
boundary
of
171
reservation
of
different
dimension
,
scattered
in
21
state
and
territory
,
presenting
great
variation
in
climate
and
in
the
kind
and
quality
of
their
soil
.
among
the
indian
upon
these
several
reservation
there
exist
the
most
marked
difference
in
natural
trait
and
disposition
and
in
their
progress
toward
civilization
.
while
some
are
lazy
,
vicious
,
and
stupid
,
others
are
industrious
,
peaceful
,
and
intelligent
;
while
a
portion
of
them
are
self-supporting
and
independent
,
and
have
so
far
advanced
in
civilization
that
they
make
their
own
law
,
administered
through
officer
of
their
own
choice
,
and
educate
their
child
in
school
of
their
own
establishment
and
maintenance
,
others
still
retain
,
in
squalor
and
dependence
,
almost
the
savagery
of
their
natural
state
.
