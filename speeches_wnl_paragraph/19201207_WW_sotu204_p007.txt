i
urge
you
to
consider
that
the
display
of
an
immediate
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
remedy
any
injustice
or
evil
that
may
have
shown
themselves
in
our
own
national
life
will
afford
the
most
effectual
offset
to
the
force
of
chaos
and
tyranny
which
are
playing
so
disastrous
a
part
in
the
fortune
of
the
free
people
of
more
than
one
part
of
the
world
.
the
united
state
is
of
necessity
the
sample
democracy
of
the
world
,
and
the
triumph
of
democracy
depends
upon
it
success
.
