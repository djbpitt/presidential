there
is
but
one
cloud
upon
our
horizon
.
that
ha
shown
itself
to
the
south
of
u
,
and
hang
over
mexico
.
there
can
be
no
certain
prospect
of
peace
in
america
until
gen.
huerta
ha
surrendered
his
usurped
authority
in
mexico
;
until
it
is
understood
on
all
hand
,
indeed
,
that
such
pretended
government
will
not
be
countenanced
or
dealt
with
by-the
government
of
the
united
state
.
we
are
the
friend
of
constitutional
government
in
america
;
we
are
more
than
it
friend
,
we
are
it
champion
;
because
in
no
other
way
can
our
neighbor
,
to
whom
we
would
wish
in
every
way
to
make
proof
of
our
friendship
,
work
out
their
own
development
in
peace
and
liberty
.
mexico
ha
no
government
.
the
attempt
to
maintain
one
at
the
city
of
mexico
ha
broken
down
,
and
a
mere
military
despotism
ha
been
set
up
which
ha
hardly
more
than
the
semblance
of
national
authority
.
it
originated
in
the
usurpation
of
victoriano
huerta
,
who
,
after
a
brief
attempt
to
play
the
part
of
constitutional
president
,
ha
at
last
cast
aside
even
the
pretense
of
legal
right
and
declared
himself
dictator
.
a
a
consequence
,
a
condition
of
affair
now
exists
in
mexico
which
ha
made
it
doubtful
whether
even
the
most
elementary
and
fundamental
right
either
of
her
own
people
or
of
the
citizen
of
other
country
resident
within
her
territory
can
long
be
successfully
safeguarded
,
and
which
threatens
,
if
long
continued
,
to
imperil
the
interest
of
peace
,
order
,
and
tolerable
life
in
the
land
immediately
to
the
south
of
u
.
even
if
the
usurper
had
succeeded
in
his
purpose
,
in
despite
of
the
constitution
of
the
republic
and
the
right
of
it
people
,
he
would
have
set
up
nothing
but
a
precarious
and
hateful
power
,
which
could
have
lasted
but
a
little
while
,
and
whose
eventual
downfall
would
have
left
the
country
in
a
more
deplorable
condition
than
ever
.
but
he
ha
not
succeeded
.
he
ha
forfeited
the
respect
and
the
moral
support
even
of
those
who
were
at
one
time
willing
to
see
him
succeed
.
little
by
little
he
ha
been
completely
isolated
.
by
a
little
every
day
his
power
and
prestige
are
crumbling
and
the
collapse
is
not
far
away
.
we
shall
not
,
1
believe
,
be
obliged
to
alter
our
policy
of
watchful
waiting
.
and
then
,
when
the
end
come
,
we
shall
hope
to
see
constitutional
order
restored
in
distressed
mexico
by
the
concert
and
energy
of
such
of
her
leader
a
prefer
the
liberty
of
their
people
to
their
own
ambition
.
