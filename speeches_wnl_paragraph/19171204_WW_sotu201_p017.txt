from
every
point
of
view
,
therefore
,
it
ha
seemed
to
be
my
duty
to
speak
these
declaration
of
purpose
,
to
add
these
specific
interpretation
to
what
i
took
the
liberty
of
saying
to
the
senate
in
january
.
our
entrance
into
the
war
ha
not
altered
our
attitude
towards
the
settlement
that
must
come
when
it
is
over
.
when
i
said
in
january
that
the
nation
of
the
world
were
entitled
not
only
to
free
pathway
upon
the
sea
but
also
to
assured
and
unmolested
access
to
those
pathway
i
wa
thinking
,
and
i
am
thinking
now
,
not
of
the
smaller
and
weaker
nation
alone
,
which
need
our
countenance
and
support
,
but
also
of
the
great
and
powerful
nation
,
and
of
our
present
enemy
a
well
a
our
present
associate
in
the
war
.
i
wa
thinking
,
and
am
thinking
now
,
of
austria
herself
,
among
the
rest
,
a
well
a
of
serbia
and
of
poland
.
justice
and
equality
of
right
can
be
had
only
at
a
great
price
.
we
are
seeking
permanent
,
not
temporary
,
foundation
for
the
peace
of
the
world
and
must
seek
them
candidly
and
fearlessly
.
a
always
,
the
right
will
prove
to
be
the
expedient
.
