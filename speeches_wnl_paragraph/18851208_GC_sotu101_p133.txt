and
those
who
live
by
labor
or
legitimate
trade
never
will
feel
that
sensation
of
cheapness
.
however
plenty
silver
dollar
may
become
,
they
will
not
be
distributed
a
gift
among
the
people
;
and
if
the
laboring
man
should
receive
four
depreciated
dollar
where
he
now
receives
but
two
,
he
will
pay
in
the
depreciated
coin
more
than
double
the
price
he
now
pay
for
all
the
necessary
and
comfort
of
life
.
