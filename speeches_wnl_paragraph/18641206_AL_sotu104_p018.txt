,
and
pensacola
have
been
opened
by
proclamation

it
is
hoped

now
consider
whether
it
is
not
safer
and
more
profitable
to
themselves
,
a
well
a
just
to
the
united
state
,
to
resort
to
these
and
other
open
port
than
it
is
to
pursue
,
through
many
hazard
and
at
vast
cost
,
a
contraband
trade
with
other
port
which
are
closed
,
if
not
by
actual
military
occupation
,
at
least
by
a
lawful
and
effective
