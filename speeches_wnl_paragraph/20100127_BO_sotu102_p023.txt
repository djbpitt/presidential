now
,
the
true
engine
of
job
creation
in
this
country
will
always
be
america
's
business
.
i
agree
,
absolutely
.
but
government
can
create
the
condition
necessary
for
business
to
expand
and
hire
more
worker
.
we
should
start
where
most
new
job
do
,
in
small
business
,
company
that
begin
when
an
entrepreneur
take
a
chance
on
a
dream
or
a
worker
decides
it
's
time
she
became
her
own
bos
.
through
sheer
grit
and
determination
,
these
company
have
weathered
the
recession
,
and
they
're
ready
to
grow
.
but
when
you
talk
to
small-business
owner
in
place
like
allentown
,
pennsylvania
,
or
elyria
,
ohio
,
you
find
out
that
even
though
bank
on
wall
street
are
lending
again
,
they
're
mostly
lending
to
bigger
company
.
financing
remains
difficult
for
small-business
owner
across
the
country
,
even
those
that
are
making
a
profit
.
