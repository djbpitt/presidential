the
postal
revenue
,
whose
ratio
of
gain
upon
the
rising
prosperity
of
1882
and
1883
outstripped
the
increasing
expense
of
our
growing
service
,
wa
checked
by
the
reduction
in
the
rate
of
letter
postage
which
took
effect
with
the
beginning
of
october
in
the
latter
year
,
and
it
diminished
during
the
two
past
fiscal
year
$
2,790,000
,
in
about
the
proportion
of
$
2,270,000
in
1884
to
$
520,000
in
1885
.
natural
growth
and
development
have
meantime
increased
expenditure
,
resulting
in
a
deficiency
in
the
revenue
to
meet
the
expense
of
the
department
of
five
and
a
quarter
million
dollar
for
the
year
1884
and
eight
and
a
third
million
in
the
last
fiscal
year
.
the
anticipated
and
natural
revival
of
the
revenue
ha
been
oppressed
and
retarded
by
the
unfavorable
business
condition
of
the
country
,
of
which
the
postal
service
is
a
faithful
indicator
.
the
gratifying
fact
is
shown
,
however
,
by
the
report
that
our
returning
prosperity
is
marked
by
a
gain
of
$
380,000
in
the
revenue
of
the
latter
half
of
the
last
year
over
the
corresponding
period
of
the
preceding
year
