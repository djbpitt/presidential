my
solicitude
to
see
the
militia
of
the
united
state
placed
on
an
efficient
establishment
ha
been
so
often
and
so
ardently
expressed
that
i
shall
but
barely
recall
the
subject
to
your
view
on
the
present
occasion
,
at
the
same
time
that
i
shall
submit
to
your
inquiry
whether
our
harbor
are
yet
sufficiently
secured
.
