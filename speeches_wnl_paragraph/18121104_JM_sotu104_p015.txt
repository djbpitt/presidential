our
affair
with
france
retain
the
posture
which
they
held
at
my
last
communication
to
you
.
notwithstanding
the
authorized
expectation
of
an
early
a
well
a
favorable
issue
to
the
discussion
on
foot
,
these
have
been
procrastinated
to
the
latest
date
.
the
only
intervening
occurrence
meriting
attention
is
the
promulgation
of
a
french
decree
purporting
to
be
a
definitive
repeal
of
the
berlin
and
milan
decree
.
this
proceeding
,
although
made
the
ground
of
the
repeal
of
the
british
order
in
council
,
is
rendered
by
the
time
and
manner
of
it
liable
to
many
objection
.
