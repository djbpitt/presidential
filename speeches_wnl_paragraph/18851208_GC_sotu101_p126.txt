if
continued
long
enough
,
this
operation
will
result
in
the
substitution
of
silver
for
all
the
gold
the
government
owns
applicable
to
it
general
purpose
.
it
will
not
do
to
rely
upon
the
custom
receipt
of
the
government
to
make
good
this
drain
of
gold
,
because
the
silver
thus
coined
having
been
made
legal
tender
for
all
debt
and
due
,
public
and
private
,
at
time
during
the
last
six
month
58
per
cent
of
the
receipt
for
duty
ha
been
in
silver
or
silver
certificate
,
while
the
average
within
that
period
ha
been
20
per
cent
.
the
proportion
of
silver
and
it
certificate
received
by
the
government
will
probably
increase
a
time
go
on
,
for
the
reason
that
the
nearer
the
period
approach
when
it
will
be
obliged
to
offer
silver
in
payment
of
it
obligation
the
greater
inducement
there
will
be
to
hoard
gold
against
depreciation
in
the
value
of
silver
or
for
the
purpose
of
speculating
.
