in
reviewing
the
present
state
of
our
country
,
our
attention
can
not
be
withheld
from
the
effect
produced
by
peculiar
season
which
have
very
generally
impaired
the
annual
gift
of
the
earth
and
threatened
scarcity
in
particular
district
.
such
,
however
,
is
the
variety
of
soil
,
of
climate
,
and
of
product
within
our
extensive
limit
that
the
aggregate
resource
for
subsistence
are
more
than
sufficient
for
the
aggregate
want
.
and
a
far
a
an
economy
of
consumption
,
more
than
usual
,
may
be
necessary
,
our
thankfulness
is
due
to
providence
for
what
is
far
more
than
a
compensation
,
in
the
remarkable
health
which
ha
distinguished
the
present
year
.
