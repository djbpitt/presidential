the
commissioner
represent
that
enough
of
the
revenue
of
the
district
are
now
on
deposit
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
state
to
repay
the
sum
advanced
by
the
government
for
sewer
improvement
under
the
act
of
june
30
,
1884
.
they
desire
now
an
advance
of
the
share
which
ultimately
should
be
borne
by
the
district
of
the
cost
of
extensive
improvement
to
the
street
of
the
city
.
the
total
expense
of
these
contemplated
improvement
is
estimated
at
$
1,000,000
,
and
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
a
considerable
sum
could
be
saved
if
they
had
all
the
money
in
hand
,
so
that
contract
for
the
whole
work
could
be
made
at
the
same
time
.
they
express
confidence
that
if
the
advance
asked
for
should
be
made
the
government
would
be
reimbursed
the
same
within
a
reasonable
time
.
i
have
no
doubt
that
these
improvement
could
be
made
much
cheaper
if
undertaken
together
and
prosecuted
according
to
a
general
plan
.
