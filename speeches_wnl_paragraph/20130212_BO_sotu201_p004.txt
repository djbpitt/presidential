but
we
gather
here
knowing
that
there
are
million
of
american
whose
hard
work
and
dedication
have
not
yet
been
rewarded
.
our
economy
is
adding
job
,
but
too
many
people
still
ca
n't
find
full-time
employment
.
corporate
profit
have
skyrocketed
to
alltime
high
,
but
for
more
than
a
decade
,
wage
and
income
have
barely
budged
.
