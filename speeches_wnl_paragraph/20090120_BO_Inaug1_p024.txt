to
the
muslim
world
,
we
seek
a
new
way
forward
,
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
.
to
those
leader
around
the
globe
who
seek
to
sow
conflict
,
or
blame
their
society
's
ill
on
the
west
,
know
that
your
people
will
judge
you
on
what
you
can
build
,
not
what
you
destroy
.
to
those
who
cling
to
power
through
corruption
and
deceit
and
the
silencing
of
dissent
,
know
that
you
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
;
but
that
we
will
extend
a
hand
if
you
are
willing
to
unclench
your
fist
.
