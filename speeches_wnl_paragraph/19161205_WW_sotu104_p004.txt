in
the
first
place
,
it
seems
to
me
imperatively
necessary
that
the
earliest
possible
consideration
and
action
should
be
accorded
the
remaining
measure
of
the
program
of
settlement
and
regulation
which
i
had
occasion
to
recommend
to
you
at
the
close
of
your
last
session
in
view
of
the
public
danger
disclosed
by
the
unaccommodated
difficulty
which
then
existed
,
and
which
still
unhappily
continue
to
exist
,
between
the
railroad
of
the
country
and
their
locomotive
engineer
,
conductor
and
trainman
.
