in
the
spirit
,
therefore
,
of
a
greater
unselfishness
,
recognizing
that
the
world—including
the
united
state
of
america—passes
through
perilous
time
,
i
am
very
hopeful
that
the
closing
session
of
the
seventy-sixth
congress
will
consider
the
need
of
the
nation
and
of
humanity
with
calmness
,
with
tolerance
and
with
cooperative
wisdom
.
