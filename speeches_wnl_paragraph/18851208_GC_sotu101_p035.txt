the
admitted
right
of
a
government
to
prevent
the
influx
of
element
hostile
to
it
internal
peace
and
security
may
not
be
questioned
,
even
where
there
is
no
treaty
stipulation
on
the
subject
.
that
the
exclusion
of
chinese
labor
is
demanded
in
other
country
where
like
condition
prevail
is
strongly
evidenced
in
the
dominion
of
canada
,
where
chinese
immigration
is
now
regulated
by
law
more
exclusive
than
our
own
.
if
existing
law
are
inadequate
to
compass
the
end
in
view
,
i
shall
be
prepared
to
give
earnest
consideration
to
any
further
remedial
measure
,
within
the
treaty
limit
,
which
the
wisdom
of
congress
may
devise
.
