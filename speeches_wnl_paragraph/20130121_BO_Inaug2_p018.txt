the
path
towards
sustainable
energy
source
will
be
long
and
sometimes
difficult
.
but
america
can
not
resist
this
transition
,
we
must
lead
it
.
we
can
not
cede
to
other
nation
the
technology
that
will
power
new
job
and
new
industry
,
we
must
claim
it
promise
.
that
's
how
we
will
maintain
our
economic
vitality
and
our
national
treasureâ€”our
forest
and
waterway
,
our
crop
land
and
snow-capped
peak
.
that
is
how
we
will
preserve
our
planet
,
commanded
to
our
care
by
god
.
that
's
what
will
lend
meaning
to
the
creed
our
father
once
declared
.
