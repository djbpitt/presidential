the
frontier
line
between
alaska
and
british
columbia
,
a
defined
by
the
treaty
of
cession
with
russia
,
follows
the
demarcation
assigned
in
a
prior
treaty
between
great
britain
and
russia
.
modern
exploration
discloses
that
this
ancient
boundary
is
impracticable
a
a
geographical
fact
.
in
the
unsettled
condition
of
that
region
the
question
ha
lacked
importance
,
but
the
discovery
of
mineral
wealth
in
the
territory
the
line
is
supposed
to
traverse
admonishes
that
the
time
ha
come
when
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
boundary
is
needful
to
avert
jurisdictional
complication
.
i
recommend
,
therefore
,
that
provision
be
made
for
a
preliminary
reconnoissance
by
officer
of
the
united
state
,
to
the
end
of
acquiring
more
precise
information
on
the
subject
.
i
have
invited
her
majesty
's
government
to
consider
with
u
the
adoption
of
a
more
convenient
line
,
to
be
established
by
meridian
observation
or
by
known
geographical
feature
without
the
necessity
of
an
expensive
survey
of
the
whole
.
