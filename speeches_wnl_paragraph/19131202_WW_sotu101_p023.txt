may
i
not
express
the
very
real
pleas-are
i
have
experienced
in
co-operating
with
this
congress
and
sharing
with
it
the
labor
of
common
service
to
which
it
ha
devoted
itself
so
unreservedly
during
the
past
seven
month
of
uncomplaining
concentration
upon
the
business
of
legislation
?
surely
it
is
a
proper
and
pertinent
part
of
my
report
on
``
the
state
of
the
union
''
to
express
my
admiration
for
the
diligence
,
the
good
temper
,
and
the
full
comprehension
of
public
duty
which
ha
already
been
manifested
by
both
the
house
;
and
i
hope
that
it
may
not
be
deemed
an
impertinent
intrusion
of
myself
into
the
picture
if
i
say
with
how
much
and
how
constant
satisfaction
i
have
availed
myself
of
the
privilege
of
putting
my
time
and
energy
at
their
disposal
alike
in
counsel
and
in
action
.
