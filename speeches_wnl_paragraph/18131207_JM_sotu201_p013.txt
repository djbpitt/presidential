the
cruelty
of
the
enemy
in
enlisting
the
savage
into
a
war
with
a
nation
desirous
of
mutual
emulation
in
mitigating
it
calamity
ha
not
been
confined
to
any
one
quarter
.
wherever
they
could
be
turned
against
u
no
exertion
to
effect
it
have
been
spared
.
on
our
southwestern
border
the
creek
tribe
,
who
,
yielding
to
our
persevering
endeavor
,
were
gradually
acquiring
more
civilized
habit
,
became
the
unfortunate
victim
of
seduction
.
a
war
in
that
quarter
ha
been
the
consequence
,
infuriated
by
a
bloody
fanaticism
recently
propagated
among
them
.
it
wa
necessary
to
crush
such
a
war
before
it
could
spread
among
the
contiguous
tribe
and
before
it
could
favor
enterprise
of
the
enemy
into
that
vicinity
.
with
this
view
a
force
wa
called
into
the
service
of
the
united
state
from
the
state
of
georgia
and
tennessee
,
which
,
with
the
nearest
regular
troop
and
other
corp
from
the
mississippi
territory
,
might
not
only
chastise
the
savage
into
present
peace
but
make
a
lasting
impression
on
their
fear
.
