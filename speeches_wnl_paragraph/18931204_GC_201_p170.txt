while
we
should
stanchly
adhere
to
the
principle
that
only
the
necessity
of
revenue
justifies
the
imposition
of
tariff
duty
and
other
federal
taxation
and
that
they
should
be
limited
by
strict
economy

we
can
not
close
our
eye
to
the
fact
that
condition
have
grown
up
among
u
which
in
justice
and
fairness
call
for
discriminating
care
in
the
distribution
of
such
duty
and
taxation
a
the
emergency
of
our
government
actually
demand
.
