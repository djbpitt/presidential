i
reluctantly
vetoed
the
budget
bill
passed
by
the
last
session
of
the
congress
because
of
a
constitutional
objection
.
the
house
of
representative
subsequently
modified
the
bill
in
order
to
meet
this
objection
.
in
the
revised
form
,
i
believe
that
the
bill
,
coupled
with
action
already
taken
by
the
congress
to
revise
it
rule
and
procedure
,
furnishes
the
foundation
for
an
effective
national
budget
system
.
i
earnestly
hope
,
therefore
,
that
one
of
the
first
step
to
be
taken
by
the
present
session
of
the
congress
will
be
to
pas
the
budget
bill
.
