for
our

we
reject
a
false
the
choice
between
our
safety
and
our
ideal
.
our
founding
father
,
faced
with
peril
we
can
scarcely
imagine
,
drafted
a

assure
the
rule

the
right

,
a

government
who
are
watching
today
,
from

the
small

where
my

every
man

woman

and
child
who
seek
a
future
of
peace
and
dignity
,
and
that
we
are
ready
to
lead
once
