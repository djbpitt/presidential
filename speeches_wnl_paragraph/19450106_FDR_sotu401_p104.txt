``
the
record
made
by
management
and
labor
in
war
industry
ha
been
a
notable
testimony
to
the
resourcefulness
and
power
of
america
.
the
need
are
so
great
,
nevertheless
,
that
in
many
instance
we
have
been
forced
to
recall
soldier
and
sailor
from
military
duty
to
do
work
of
a
civilian
character
in
war
production
,
because
of
the
urgency
of
the
need
for
equipment
and
because
of
inability
to
recruit
civilian
labor
.
