the
necessity
for
such
legislation
is
manifest
and
pressing
.
those
who
have
entrusted

with
the
responsibility
and
duty
of
serving
and
safeguarding
them
in
such
matter
would
find
it
hard
,
i
believe
,
to
excuse
a
failure
to
act
upon
these
grave
matter
or
any
unnecessary
postponement
of
action
upon
them
.
