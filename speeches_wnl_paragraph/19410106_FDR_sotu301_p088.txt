since
the
beginning
of
our
american
history
,
we
have
been
engaged
in
change—in
a
perpetual
peaceful
revolution—a
revolution
which
go
on
steadily
,
quietly
adjusting
itself
to
changing
conditions—without
the
concentration
camp
or
the
quick-lime
in
the
ditch
.
the
world
order
which
we
seek
is
the
cooperation
of
free
country
,
working
together
in
a
friendly
,
civilized
society
.
