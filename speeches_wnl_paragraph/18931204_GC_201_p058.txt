during
my
former
administration
i
took
occasion
to
recommend
a
recast
of
the
law
relating
to
the
consular
service
,
in
order
that
it
might
become
a
more
efficient
agency
in
the
promotion
of
the
interest
it
wa
intended
to
subserve
.
the
duty
and
power
of
consul
have
been
expanded
with
the
growing
requirement
of
our
foreign
trade
.
discharging
important
duty
affecting
our
commerce
and
american
citizen
abroad
,
and
in
certain
country
exercising
judicial
function
,
these
officer
should
be
men
of
character
,
intelligence
,
and
ability
.
