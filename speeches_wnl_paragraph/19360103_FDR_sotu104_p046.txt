but
the
challenge
faced
by
this
congress
is
more
menacing
than
merely
a
return
to
the
past—bad
a
that
would
be
.
our
resplendent
economic
autocracy
doe
not
want
to
return
to
that
individualism
of
which
they
prate
,
even
though
the
advantage
under
that
system
went
to
the
ruthless
and
the
strong
.
they
realize
that
in
thirty-four
month
we
have
built
up
new
instrument
of
public
power
.
in
the
hand
of
a
people
's
government
this
power
is
wholesome
and
proper
.
but
in
the
hand
of
political
puppet
of
an
economic
autocracy
such
power
would
provide
shackle
for
the
liberty
of
the
people
.
give
them
their
way
and
they
will
take
the
course
of
every
autocracy
of
the
past
—power
for
themselves
,
enslavement
for
the
public
.
