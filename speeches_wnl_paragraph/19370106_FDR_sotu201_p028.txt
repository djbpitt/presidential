it
is
worth
our
while
to
read
and
reread
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
,
and
article
i
thereof
which
confers
the
legislative
power
upon
the
congress
of
the
united
state
.
it
is
also
worth
our
while
to
read
again
the
debate
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
year
ago
.
from
such
reading
,
i
obtain
the
very
definite
thought
that
the
member
of
that
convention
were
fully
aware
that
civilization
would
raise
problem
for
the
proposed
new
federal
government
,
which
they
themselves
could
not
even
surmise
;
and
that
it
wa
their
definite
intent
and
expectation
that
a
liberal
interpretation
in
the
year
to
come
would
give
to
the
congress
the
same
relative
power
over
new
national
problem
a
they
themselves
gave
to
the
congress
over
the
national
problem
of
their
day
.
