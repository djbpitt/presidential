the
work
of
the
signal
service
ha
been
prosecuted
during
the
last
year
with
result
of
increasing
benefit
to
the
country
.
the
field
of
instruction
ha
been
enlarged
with
a
view
of
adding
to
it
usefulness

the

in
view
of
the
fact
referred
to
by
the
secretary
of
war
,
that
the
work
of
this
service
ordinarily
is
of
a
scientific
nature
,
and
the
further
fact
that
it
is
assuming
larger
proportion
constantly
and
becoming
more
and
more
unsuited
to
the
fixed
rule
which
must
govern
the
army
,
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
him
in
the
opinion
that
it
should
be
separately
established
.
if
this
is
done
,
the
scope
and
extent
of
it
operation
should
,
a
nearly
a
possible
,
be
definitely
prescribed
by
law
and
always
capable
of
exact
ascertainment
.
