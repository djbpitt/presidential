everywhere
we
look
,
there
is
work
to
be
done
.
the
state
of
the
economy
call
for
action
,
bold
and
swift
,
and
we
will
actâ€”not
only
to
create
new
job
,
but
to
lay
a
new
foundation
for
growth
.
we
will
build
the
road
and
bridge
,
the
electric
grid
and
digital
line
that
feed
our
commerce
and
bind
u
together
.
we
will
restore
science
to
it
rightful
place
,
and
wield
technology
's
wonder
to
raise
health
care
's
quality
and
lower
it
cost
.
we
will
harness
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
the
soil
to
fuel
our
car
and
run
our
factory
.
and
we
will
transform
our
school
and
college
and
university
to
meet
the
demand
of
a
new
age
.
all
this
we
