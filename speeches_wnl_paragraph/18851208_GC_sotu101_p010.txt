early
in
march
last
war
broke
out
in
central
america
,
caused
by
the
attempt
of
guatemala
to
consolidate
the
several
state
into
a
single
government
.
in
these
contest
between
our
neighboring
state
the
united
state
forebore
to
interfere
actively
,
but
lent
the
aid
of
their
friendly
office
in
deprecation
of
war
and
to
promote
peace
and
concord
among
the
belligerent
,
and
by
such
counsel
contributed
importantly
to
the
restoration
of
tranquillity
in
that
locality
.
