my
fellow
american
,
the
oath
i
have
sworn
before
you
today
,
like
the
one
recited
by
others
who
serve
in
this
capitol
,
wa
an
oath
to
god
and
country
,
not
party
or
faction
.
and
we
must
faithfully
execute
that
pledge
during
the
duration
of
our
service
.
but
the
word
i
spoke
today
are
not
so
different
from
the
oath
that
is
taken
each
time
a
soldier
sign
up
for
duty
or
an
immigrant
realizes
her
dream
.
my
oath
is
not
so
different
from
the
pledge
we
all
make
to
the
flag
that
wave
above
and
that
fill
our
heart
with
pride
.
