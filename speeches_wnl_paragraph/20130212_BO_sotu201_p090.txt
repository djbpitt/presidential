we
should
follow
the
example
of
a
north
miami
woman
named
desiline
victor
.
when
desiline
arrived
at
her
polling
place
,
she
wa
told
the
wait
to
vote
might
be
6
hour
.
and
a
time
ticked
by
,
her
concern
wa
not
with
her
tired
body
or
aching
foot
,
but
whether
folk
like
her
would
get
to
have
their
say
.
and
hour
after
hour
,
a
throng
of
people
stayed
in
line
to
support
her
,
because
desiline
is
102
year
old
.
and
they
erupted
in
cheer
when
she
finally
put
on
a
sticker
that
read
,
``
i
voted
.
''
[
applause
]
there's
desiline
.
