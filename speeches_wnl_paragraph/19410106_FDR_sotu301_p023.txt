there
is
much
loose
talk
of
our
immunity
from
immediate
and
direct
invasion
from
across
the
sea
.
obviously
,
a
long
a
the
british
navy
retains
it
power
,
no
such
danger
exists
.
even
if
there
were
no
british
navy
,
it
is
not
probable
that
any
enemy
would
be
stupid
enough
to
attack
u
by
landing
troop
in
the
united
state
from
across
thousand
of
mile
of
ocean
,
until
it
had
acquired
strategic
base
from
which
to
operate
.
