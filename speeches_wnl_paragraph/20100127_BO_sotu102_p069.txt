but
what
frustrates
the
american
people
is
a
washington
where
every
day
is
election
day
.
we
ca
n't
wage
a
perpetual
campaign
where
the
only
goal
is
to
see
who
can
get
the
most
embarrassing
headline
about
the
other
side
,
a
belief
that
if
you
lose
,
i
win
.
neither
party
should
delay
or
obstruct
every
single
bill
just
because
they
can
.
the
confirmation
ofâ€”i
'm
speaking
to
both
party
now
.
the
confirmation
of
well-qualified
public
servant
should
n't
be
held
hostage
to
the
pet
project
or
grudge
of
a
few
individual
senator
.
