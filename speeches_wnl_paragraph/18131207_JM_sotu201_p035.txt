if
the
war
ha
exposed
u
to
increased
spoliation
on
the

and
to
predatory
incursion
on
the
land

it
ha
developed
the
national
mean
of
retaliating
the
former
and
of
providing
protection
against
the
latter
,
demonstrating
to
all
that
every
blow
aimed
at
our
maritime
independence
is
an
impulse
accelerating
the
growth
of
our
maritime
power
.
