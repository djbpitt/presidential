hold
that
,
in
contemplation
of
universal
law
and
of
the
constitution
,
the
union
of
these
state
is
perpetual
.
perpetuity
is
implied
,
if
not
expressed
,
in
the
fundamental
law
of
all
national
government
.
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
no
government
proper
ever
had
a
provision
in
it
organic
law
for
it
own
termination
.
continue
to
execute
all
the
express
provision
of
our
national
constitution
,
and
the
union
will
endure
foreverâ€”it
being
impossible
to
destroy
it
except
by
some
action
not
provided
for
in
the
instrument
itself
.
