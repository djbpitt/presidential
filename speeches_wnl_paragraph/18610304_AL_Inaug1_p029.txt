i
do
not
forget
the
position
,
assumed
by
some
,
that
constitutional
question
are
to
be
decided
by
the
supreme
court
;
nor
do
i
deny
that
such
decision
must
be
binding
,
in
any
case
,
upon
the
party
to
a
suit
,
a
to
the
object
of
that
suit
,
while
they
are
also
entitled
to
very
high
respect
and
consideration
in
all
parallel
case
by
all
other
department
of
the
government
.
and
while
it
is
obviously
possible
that
such
decision
may
be
erroneous
in
any
given
case
,
still
the
evil
effect
following
it
,
being
limited
to
that
particular
case
,
with
the
chance
that
it
may
be
overruled
and
never
become
a
precedent
for
other
case
,
can
better
be
borne
than
could
the
evil
of
a
different
practice
.
at
the
same
time
,
the
candid
citizen
must
confess
that
if
the
policy
of
the
government
,
upon
vital
question
affecting
the
whole
people
,
is
to
be
irrevocably
fixed
by
decision
of
the
supreme
court
,
the
instant
they
are
made
,
in
ordinary
litigation
between
party
in
personal
action
,
the
people
will
have
ceased
to
be
their
own
ruler
,
having
to
that
extent
practically
resigned
their
government
into
the
hand
of
that
eminent
tribunal
.
nor
is
there
in
this
view
any
assault
upon
the
court
or
the
judge
.
it
is
a
duty
from
which
they
may
not
shrink
to
decide
case
properly
brought
before
them
,
and
it
is
no
fault
of
theirs
if
others
seek
to
turn
their
decision
to
political
purpose
.
