my
immediate
predecessor
caused
to
be
negotiated
with
nicaragua
a
treaty
for
the
construction
,
by
and
at
the
sole
cost
of
the
united
state
,
of
a
canal
through
nicaraguan
territory
,
and
laid
it
before
the
senate
.
pending
the
action
of
that
body
thereon
,
i
withdrew
the
treaty
for
reexamination
.
attentive
consideration
of
it
provision
lead
me
to
withhold
it
from
resubmission
to
the
senate
.
