from
some
on
the
right
,
i
expect
we
'll
hear
a
different
argument
,
that
if
we
just
make
fewer
investment
in
our
people
,
extend
tax
cut
,
including
those
for
the
wealthier
american
,
eliminate
more
regulation
,
maintain
the
status
quo
on
health
care
,
our
deficit
will
go
away
.
the
problem
is
,
that
's
what
we
did
for
8
year
.
that
's
what
helped
u
into
this
crisis
.
it
's
what
helped
lead
to
these
deficit
.
we
ca
n't
do
it
again
.
