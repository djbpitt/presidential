the
rebellion
which
ha
so
long
been
flagrant
in
china
ha
at
last
been
suppressed
,
with
the
cooperating
good
office
of
this
government
and
of
the
other
western
commercial
state
.
the
judicial
consular
establishment
there
ha
become
very
difficult
and
onerous
,
and
it
will
need
legislative
revision
to
adapt
it
to
the
extension
of
our
commerce
and
to
the
more
intimate
intercourse
which
ha
been
instituted
with
the
government
and
people
of
that
vast
empire
.
china
seems
to
be
accepting
with
hearty
good
will
the
conventional
law
which
regulate
commercial
and
social
intercourse
among
the
western
nation
.
