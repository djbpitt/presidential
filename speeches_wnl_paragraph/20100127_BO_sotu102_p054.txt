at
the
beginning
of
the
last
decade
,
the
year
2000
,
america
had
a
budget
surplus
of
over
$
200
billion
.
by
the
time
i
took
office
,
we
had
a
1-year
deficit
of
over
$
1
trillion
and
projected
deficit
of
$
8
trillion
over
the
next
decade
.
most
of
this
wa
the
result
of
not
paying
for
two
war
,
two
tax
cut
,
and
an
expensive
prescription
drug
program
.
on
top
of
that
,
the
effect
of
the
recession
put
a
$
3
trillion
hole
in
our
budget
.
all
this
wa
before
i
walked
in
the
door
.
