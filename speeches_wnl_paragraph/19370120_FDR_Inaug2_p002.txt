our
covenant
with
ourselves
did
not
stop
there
.
instinctively
we
recognized
a
deeper
needâ€”the
need
to
find
through
government
the
instrument
of
our
united
purpose
to
solve
for
the
individual
the
ever-rising
problem
of
a
complex
civilization
.
repeated
attempt
at
their
solution
without
the
aid
of
government
had
left
u
baffled
and
bewildered
.
for
,
without
that
aid
,
we
had
been
unable
to
create
those
moral
control
over
the
service
of
science
which
are
necessary
to
make
science
a
useful
servant
instead
of
a
ruthless
master
of
mankind
.
to
do
this
we
knew
that
we
must
find
practical
control
over
blind
economic
force
and
blindly
selfish
men
.
