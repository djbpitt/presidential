an
occurrence
ha
indeed
taken
place
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
,
if
sanctioned
by
the
spanish
government
,
may
make
an
exception
a
to
that
power
.
according
to
the
report
of
our
naval
commander
on
that
station
,
one
of
our
public
armed
vessel
wa
attacked
by
an
over-powering
force
under
a
spanish
commander
,
and
the
american
flag
,
with
the
officer
and
crew
,
insulted
in
a
manner
calling
for
prompt
reparation
.
this
ha
been
demanded
.
in
the
mean
time
a
frigate
and
a
smaller
vessel
of
war
have
been
ordered
into
that
gulf
for
the
protection
of
our
commerce
.
it
would
be
improper
to
omit
that
the
representative
of
his
catholic
majesty
in
the
united
state
lost
no
time
in
giving
the
strongest
assurance
that
no
hostile
order
could
have
emanated
from
his
government
,
and
that
it
will
be
a
ready
to
do
a
to
expect
whatever
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
friendly
relation
of
the
two
country
shall
be
found
to
require
.
