i
suppose
it
will
not
be
denied
that
under
the
present
law
our
people
obtain
the
necessary
of
a
comfortable
existence
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
formerly
.
this
is
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
,
since
it
is
the
palpable
duty
of
every
just
government
to
make
the
burden
of
taxation
a
light
a
possible
.
the
people
should
not
be
required
to
relinquish
this
privilege
of
cheaper
living
except
under
the
stress
of
their
government
's
necessity
made
plainly
manifest
.
