and
the
same
is
true
in
all
joint
operation
wherein
those
engaged
can
have
none
but
a
common
end
in
view
and
can
differ
only
a
to
the
choice
of
mean
.
in
a
storm
at
sea
no
one
on
board
can
wish
the
ship
to
sink
,
and
yet
not
unfrequently
all
go
down
together
because
too
many
will
direct
and
no
single
mind
can
be
allowed
to
control
.
