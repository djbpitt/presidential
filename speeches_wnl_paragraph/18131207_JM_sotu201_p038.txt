in
fine
,
the
war
,
with
all
it
vicissitude
,
is
illustrating
the
capacity
and
the
destiny
of
the
united
state
to
be
a
great
,
a
flourishing
,
and
a
powerful
nation
,
worthy
of
the
friendship
which
it
is
disposed
to
cultivate
with
all
others
,
and
authorized
by
it
own
example
to
require
from
all
an
observance
of
the
law
of
justice
and
reciprocity
.
beyond
these
their
claim
have
never
extended
,
and
in
contending
for
these
we
behold
a
subject
for
our
congratulation
in
the
daily
testimony
of
increasing
harmony
throughout
the
nation
,
and
may
humbly
repose
our
trust
in
the
smile
of
heaven
on
so
righteous
a
cause
.
