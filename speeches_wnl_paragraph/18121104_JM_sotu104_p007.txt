effect

followed
by
signal
proof
that
the
national
spirit

according
to
the
pressure

the

of

new
ardor

no

every
citizen
wa
ready
to
fly
with
his
arm
at

to
protect
his
brother
against
the
blood-thirsty
savage
let
loose
by
the
enemy
on
an
extensive
frontier
,
and
to
convert
a
partial
calamity
into
a
source
of
invigorated
effort
.
this
patriotic
zeal
,
which
it
wa

rather
to

ha
embodied
an

force
from
