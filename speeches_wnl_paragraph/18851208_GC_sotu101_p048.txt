the
dispute
of
germany
and
spain
relative
to
the
domination
of
the
caroline
island
ha
attracted
the
attention
of
this
government
by
reason
of
extensive
interest
of
american
citizen
having
grown
up
in
those
part
during
the
past
thirty
year
,
and
because
the
question
of
ownership
involves
jurisdiction
of
matter
affecting
the
status
of
our
citizen
under
civil
and
criminal
law
.
while
standing
wholly
aloof
from
the
proprietary
issue
raised
between
power
to
both
of
which
the
united
state
are
friendly
,
this
government
expects
that
nothing
in
the
present
contention
shall
unfavorably
affect
our
citizen
carrying
on
a
peaceful
commerce
or
there
domiciled
,
and
ha
so
informed
the
government
of
spain
and
germany
.
