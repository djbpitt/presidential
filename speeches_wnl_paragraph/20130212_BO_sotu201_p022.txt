now
,
most
of
u
agree
that
a
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
must
be
part
of
our
agenda
.
but
let
's
be
clear
:
deficit
reduction
alone
is
not
an
economic
plan
.
a
growing
economy
that
creates
good
,
middle
class
job
,
that
must
be
the
north
star
that
guide
our
effort
.
every
day
,
we
should
ask
ourselves
three
question
a
a
nation
:
how
do
we
attract
more
job
to
our
shore
?
how
do
we
equip
our
people
with
the
skill
they
need
to
get
those
job
?
and
how
do
we
make
sure
that
hard
work
lead
to
a
decent
living
?
