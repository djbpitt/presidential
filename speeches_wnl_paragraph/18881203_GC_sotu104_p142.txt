the
various
step
which
have
been
taken
to
improve
the
business
method
of
the
department
are
reviewed
by
the
secretary
.
the
purchasing
of
supply
ha
been
consolidated
and
placed
under
a
responsible
bureau
head
.
this
ha
resulted
in
the
curtailment
of
open
purchase
,
which
in
the
year
1884
and
1885
amounted
to
over
50
per
cent
of
all
the
purchase
of
the
department
,
to
le
than
11
per
cent
;
so
that
at
the
present
time
about
90
per
cent
of
the
total
departmental
purchase
are
made
by
contract
and
after
competition
.
a
the
expenditure
on
this
account
exceed
an
average
of
$
2,000,000
annually
,
it
is
evident
that
an
important
improvement
in
the
system
ha
been
inaugurated
and
substantial
economy
introduced
.
