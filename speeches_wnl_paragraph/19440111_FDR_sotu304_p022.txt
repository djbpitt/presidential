the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
people
have
met
the
demand
of
this
war
with
magnificent
courage
and
understanding
.
they
have
accepted
inconvenience
;
they
have
accepted
hardship
;
they
have
accepted
tragic
sacrifice
.
and
they
are
ready
and
eager
to
make
whatever
further
contribution
are
needed
to
win
the
war
a
quickly
a
possible-
if
only
they
are
given
the
chance
to
know
what
is
required
of
them
.
