in
obedience
to
a
constitutional
requirement
i
herein
submit
to
the
congress
certain
information
concerning
national
affair
,
with
the
suggestion
of
such
legislation
a
in
my
judgment
is
necessary
and
expedient
.
to
secure
brevity
and
avoid
tiresome
narration
i
shall
omit
many
detail
concerning
matter
within
federal
control
which
,
though
by
no
mean
unimportant
,
are
more
profitably
discussed
in
departmental
report
.
i
shall
also
further
curtail
this
communication
by
omitting
a
minute
recital
of
many
minor
incident
connected
with
our
foreign
relation
which
have
heretofore
found
a
place
in
executive
message
,
but
are
now
contained
in
a
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
,
which
is
herewith
submitted
.
