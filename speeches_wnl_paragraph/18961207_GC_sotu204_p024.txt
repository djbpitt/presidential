nevertheless
,
realizing
that
suspicion
and
precaution
on
the
part
of
the
weaker
of
two
combatant
are
always
natural
and
not
always
unjustifiable
,
being
sincerely
desirous
in
the
interest
of
both
a
well
a
on
it
own
account
that
the
cuban
problem
should
be
solved
with
the
least
possible
delay
,
it
wa
intimated
by
this
government
to
the
government
of
spain
some
month
ago
that
if
a
satisfactory
measure
of
home
rule
were
tendered
the
cuban
insurgent
and
would
be
accepted
by
them
upon
a
guaranty
of
it
execution
the
united
state
would
endeavor
to
find
a
way
not
objectionable
to
spain
of
furnishing
such
graranty
.
while
no
definite
response
to
this
intimation
ha
yet
been
received
from
the
spanish
government
,
it
is
believed
to
be
not
altogether
unwelcome
,
while
,
a
already
suggested
,
no
reason
is
perceived
why
it
should
not
be
approved
by
the
insurgent
.
neither
party
can
fail
to
see
the
importance
of
early
action
,
and
both
must
realize
that
to
prolong
the
present
state
of
thing
for
even
a
short
period
will
add
enormously
to
the
time
and
labor
and
expenditure
necessary
to
bring
about
the
industrial
recuperation
of
the
island
.
it
is
therefore
fervently
hoped
on
all
ground
that
earnest
effort
for
healing
the
breach
between
spain
and
the
insurgent
cuban
upon
the
line
above
indicated
may
be
at
once
inaugurated
and
pushed
to
an
immediate
and
successful
issue
.
the
friendly
office
of
the
united
state
,
either
in
the
manner
above
outlined
or
in
any
other
way
consistent
with
our
constitution
and
law
,
will
always
be
at
the
disposal
of
either
party
.
