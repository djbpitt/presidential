it
also
appears
from
this
report
that
though
prior
to
march
,
1885
,
there
had
been
but
6
conviction
in
the
territory
of
utah
and
idaho
under
the
law
of
1862
and
1882
,
punishing
polygamy
and
unlawful
cohabitation
a
crime
,
there
have
been
since
that
date
nearly
600
conviction
under
these
law
and
the
statute
of
1887
;
and
the
opinion
is
expressed
that
under
such
a
firm
and
vigilant
execution
of
these
law
and
the
advance
of
idea
opposed
to
the
forbidden
practice
polygamy
within
the
united
state
is
virtually
at
an
end
.
