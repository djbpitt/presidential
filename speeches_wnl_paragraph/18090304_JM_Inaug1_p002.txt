the
present
situation
of
the
world
is
indeed
without
a
parallel
and
that
of
our
own
country
full
of
difficulty
.
the
pressure
of
these
,
too
,
is
the
more
severely
felt
because
they
have
fallen
upon
u
at
a
moment
when
the
national
prosperity
being
at
a
height
not
before
attained
,
the
contrast
resulting
from
the
change
ha
been
rendered
the
more
striking
.
under
the
benign
influence
of
our
republican
institution
,
and
the
maintenance
of
peace
with
all
nation
whilst
so
many
of
them
were
engaged
in
bloody
and
wasteful
war
,
the
fruit
of
a
just
policy
were
enjoyed
in
an
unrivaled
growth
of
our
faculty
and
resource
.
proof
of
this
were
seen
in
the
improvement
of
agriculture
,
in
the
successful
enterprise
of
commerce
,
in
the
progress
of
manufacturer
and
useful
art
,
in
the
increase
of
the
public
revenue
and
the
use
made
of
it
in
reducing
the
public
debt
,
and
in
the
valuable
work
and
establishment
everywhere
multiplying
over
the
face
of
our
land
