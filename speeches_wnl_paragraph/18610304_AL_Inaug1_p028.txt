plainly
,
the
central
idea
of
secession
is
the
essence
of
anarchy
.
a
majority
held
in
restraint
by
constitutional
check
and
limitation
,
and
always
changing
easily
with
deliberate
change
of
popular
opinion
and
sentiment
,
is
the
only
true
sovereign
of
a
free
people
.
whoever
reject
it
doe
,
of
necessity
,
fly
to
anarchy
or
to
despotism
.
unanimity
is
impossible
;
the
rule
of
a
minority
,
a
a
permanent
arrangement
,
is
wholly
inadmissible
;
so
that
,
rejecting
the
majority
principle
,
anarchy
or
despotism
in
some
form
is
all
that
is
left
.
