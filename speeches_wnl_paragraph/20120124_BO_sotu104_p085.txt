i
'm
a
democrat
,
but
i
believe
what
republican
abraham
lincoln
believed
:
that
government
should
do
for
people
only
what
they
can
not
do
better
by
themselves
and
no
more
.
that's
why
my
education
reform
offer
more
competition
and
more
control
for
school
and
state
.
that
's
why
we
're
getting
rid
of
regulation
that
do
n't
work
.
that
's
why
our
health
care
law
relies
on
a
reformed
private
market
,
not
a
government
program
.
