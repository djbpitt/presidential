a
soon
a
the
war
in
europe
had
embraced
those
power
with
whom
the
united
state
have
the
most
extensive
relation
there
wa
reason
to
apprehend
that
our
intercourse
with
them
might
be
interrupted
and
our
disposition
for
peace
drawn
into
question
by
the
suspicion
too
often
entertained
by
belligerent
nation
.
it
seemed
,
therefore
,
to
be
my
duty
to
admonish
our
citizen
of
the
consequence
of
a
contraband
trade
and
of
hostile
act
to
any
of
the
party
,
and
to
obtain
by
a
declaration
of
the
existing
legal
state
of
thing
an
easier
admission
of
our
right
to
the
immunity
belonging
to
our
situation
.
under
these
impression
the
proclamation
which
will
be
laid
before
you
wa
issued
.
