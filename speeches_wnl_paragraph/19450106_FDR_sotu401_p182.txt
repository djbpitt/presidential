most
important
of
allâ€”1945
can
and
must
see
the
substantial
beginning
of
the
organization
of
world
peace
.
this
organization
must
be
the
fulfillment
of
the
promise
for
which
men
have
fought
and
died
in
this
war
.
it
must
be
the
justification
of
all
the
sacrifice
that
have
been
made-
of
all
the
dreadful
misery
that
this
world
ha
endured
.
