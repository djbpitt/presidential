one
of
the
unavoidable
consequence
of
the
present
insurrection
is
the
entire
suppression
in
many
place
of
all
the
ordinary
mean
of
administering
civil
justice
by
the
officer
and
in
the
form
of
existing
law
.
this
is
the
case
,
in
whole
or
in
part
,
in
all
the
insurgent
state
;
and
a
our
army
advance
upon
and
take
possession
of
part
of
those
state
the
practical
evil
becomes
more
apparent
.
there
are
no
court
nor
officer
to
whom
the
citizen
of
other
state
may
apply
for
the
enforcement
of
their
lawful
claim
against
citizen
of
the
insurgent
state
,
and
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
debt
constituting
such
claim
.
some
have
estimated
it
a
high
a
$
200,000,000
,
due
in
large
part
from
insurgent
in
open
rebellion
to
loyal
citizen
who
are
even
now
making
great
sacrifice
in
the
discharge
of
their
patriotic
duty
to
support
the
government
.
