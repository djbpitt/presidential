apprehension
seems
to
exist
among
the
people
of
the
southern
state
that
by
the
accession
of
a
republican
administration
their
property
and
their
peace
and
personal
security
are
to
be
endangered
.
there
ha
never
been
any
reasonable
cause
for
such
apprehension
.
indeed
,
the
most
ample
evidence
to
the
contrary
ha
all
the
while
existed
and
been
open
to
their
inspection
.
it
is
found
in
nearly
all
the
published
speech
of
him
who
now
address
you
.
i
do
but
quote
from
one
of
those
speech
when
i
declare
that
``
i
have
no
purpose
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
to
interfere
with
the
institution
of
slavery
in
the
state
where
it
exists
.
i
beheve
i
have
no
lawful
right
to
do
so
,
and
i
have
no
inclination
to
do
so
.
''
those
who
nominated
and
elected
me
did
so
with
full
knowledge
that
i
had
made
this
and
many
similar
declaration
,
and
had
never
recanted
them
.
and
,
more
than
this
,
they
placed
in
the
platform
for
my
acceptance
,
and
a
a
law
to
themselves
and
to
me
,
the
clear
and
emphatic
resolution
which
i
now
read
:
