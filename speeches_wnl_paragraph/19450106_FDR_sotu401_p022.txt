alwaysâ€”from
the
very
day
we
were
attacked-
it
wa
right
militarily
a
well
a
morally
to
reject
the
argument
of
those
shortsighted
people
who
would
have
had
u
throw
britain
and
russia
to
the
nazi
wolf
and
concentrate
against
the
japanese
.
such
people
urged
that
we
fight
a
purely
defensive
war
against
japan
while
allowing
the
domination
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
by
nazism
and
fascism
.
