a
you
know
,
i
have
for
three
year
hesitated
to
recommend
a
national
service
act
.
today
,
however
,
i
am
convinced
of
it
necessity
.
although
i
believe
that
we
and
our
ally
can
win
the
war
without
such
a
measure
,
i
am
certain
that
nothing
le
than
total
mobilization
of
all
our
resource
of
manpower
and
capital
will
guarantee
an
earlier
victory
,
and
reduce
the
toll
of
suffering
and
sorrow
and
blood
.
