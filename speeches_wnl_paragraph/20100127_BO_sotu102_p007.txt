so
i
know
the
anxiety
that
are
out
there
right
now
.
they
're
not
new
.
these
struggle
are
the
reason
i
ran
for
president
.
these
struggle
are
what
i
've
witnessed
for
year
,
in
place
like
elkhart
,
indiana
;
galesburg
,
illinois
.
i
hear
about
them
in
the
letter
that
i
read
each
night
.
the
toughest
to
read
are
those
written
by
child
asking
why
they
have
to
move
from
their
home
,
asking
when
their
mom
or
dad
will
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
.
