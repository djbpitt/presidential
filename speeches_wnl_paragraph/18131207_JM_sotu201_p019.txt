wa
hoped
that
this
necessary
consequence
of
the
step
unadvisedly
taken
on
the
part
of
great
britain
would
have
led
her
government
to
reflect
on
the
inconsistency
of
it
conduct
,
and
that
a
sympathy
with
the
british
,
if
not
with
the
american
,
sufferer
would
have
arrested
the
cruel
career
opened
by
it
example
.
