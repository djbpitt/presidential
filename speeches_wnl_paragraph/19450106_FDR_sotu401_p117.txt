in
the
future
world
the
misuse
of
power
,
a
implied
in
the
term
``
power
politics
,
''
must
not
be
a
controlling
factor
in
international
relation
.
that
is
the
heart
of
the
principle
to
which
we
have
subscribed
.
we
can
not
deny
that
power
is
a
factor
in
world
politics
any
more
than
we
can
deny
it
existence
a
a
factor
in
national
politics
.
but
in
a
democratic
world
,
a
in
a
democratic
nation
,
power
must
be
linked
with
responsibility
,
and
obliged
to
defend
and
justify
itself
within
the
framework
of
the
general
good
.
