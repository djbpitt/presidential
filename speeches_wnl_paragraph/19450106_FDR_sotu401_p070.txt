because
of
increased
demand
from
overseas
,
the
army
service
force
in
the
month
of
october
,
1944
,
had
to
increase
it
estimate
of
required
production
by
10
percent
.
but
in
november
,
one
month
later
,
the
requirement
for
1945
had
to
be
increased
another
10
percent
,
sending
the
production
goal
well
above
anything
we
have
yet
attained
.
our
armed
force
in
combat
have
steadily
increased
their
expenditure
of
medium
and
heavy
artillery
ammunition
.
a
we
continue
the
decisive
phase
of
this
war
,
the
munition
that
we
expend
will
mount
day
by
day
.
