from
one
point
of
view
it
is
not
necessary
to
broach
this
fundamental
matter
.
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
american
people
know
what
the
war
is
about
and
what
sort
of
an
outcome
they
will
regard
a
a
realization
of
their
purpose
in
it
.
a
a
nation
we
are
united
in
spirit
and
intention
.
i
pay
little
heed
to
those
who
tell
me
otherwise
.
i
hear
the
voice
of
dissent
;
who
doe
not
?
i
hear
the
criticism
and
the
clamor
of
the
noisily
thoughtless
and
troublesome
.
i
also
see
men
here
and
there
fling
themselves
in
impotent
disloyalty
against
the
calm
,
indomitable
power
of
the
nation
.
i
hear
men
debate
peace
who
understand
neither
it
nature
not
the
way
in
which
we
may
attain
it
with
uplifted
eye
and
unbroken
spirit
.
but
i
know
that
none
of
these
speaks
for
the
nation
.
they
do
not
touch
the
heart
of
anything
.
they
may
safely
be
left
to
strut
their
uneasy
hour
and
be
forgotten
.
