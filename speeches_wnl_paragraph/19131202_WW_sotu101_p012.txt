turn
from
the
farm
to
the
world
of
business
which
center
in
the
city
and
in
the
factory
,
and
i
think
that
all
thoughtful
observer
will
agree
that
the
immediate
service
we
owe
the
business
community
of
the
country
is
to
prevent
private
monopoly
more
effectually
than
it
ha
yet
been
prevented
.
i
think
it
will
be
easily
agreed
that
we
should
let
the
sherman
anti-trust
law
stand
,
unaltered
,
a
it
is
,
with
it
debatable
ground
about
it
,
but
that
we
should
a
much
a
possible
reduce
the
area
of
that
debatable
ground
by
further
and
more
explicit
legislation
;
and
should
also
supplement
that
great
act
by
legislation
which
will
not
only
clarify
it
but
also
facilitate
it
administration
and
make
it
fairer
to
all
concerned
.
no
doubt
we
shall
all
wish
,
and
the
country
will
expect
,
this
to
be
the
central
subject
of
our
deliberation
during
the
present
session
;
but
it
is
a
subject
so
manysided
and
so
deserving
of
careful
and
discriminating
discussion
that
1
shall
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
upon
it
in
a
special
message
at
a
later
date
than
this
.
it
is
of
capital
importance
that
the
business
men
of
this
country
should
be
relieved
of
all
uncertainty
of
law
with
regard
to
their
enterprise
and
investment
and
a
clear
path
indicated
which
they
can
travel
without
anxiety
.
it
is
a
important
that
they
should
be
relieved
of
embarrassment
and
set
free
to
prosper
a
that
private
monopoly
should
be
destroyed
.
the
way
of
action
should
be
thrown
wide
open
.
