starting
in
2011
,
we
are
prepared
to
freeze
government
spending
for
3
year
.
spending
related
to
our
national
security
,
medicare
,
medicaid
,
and
social
security
will
not
be
affected
.
but
all
other
discretionary
government
program
will
.
like
any
cash-strapped
family
,
we
will
work
within
a
budget
to
invest
in
what
we
need
and
sacrifice
what
we
do
n't
.
and
if
i
have
to
enforce
this
discipline
by
veto
,
i
will
.
