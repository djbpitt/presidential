but
it
is
submitted
that
there
is
lack
of
a
fixed
purpose
or
policy
on
this

should
be
supplied

it
is
useless
to
dilate
upon
the
wrong
of
the
indian
,
and
a
useless
to
indulge
in
the
heartless
belief
that
because
their
wrong
are
revenged
in
their
own
atrocious
manner
,
therefore
they
should
be
exterminated
.
