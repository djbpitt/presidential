these
resource
are
amply
sufficient
to
bring
the
war
to
an
honorable
issue
.
our
nation
is
in
number
more
than
half
that
of
the
british
isle
.
it
is
composed
of
a
brave
,
a
free
,
a
virtuous
,
and
an
intelligent
people
.
our
country
abounds
in
the
necessary
,
the
art
,
and
the
comfort
of
life
.
a
general
prosperity
is
visible
in
the
public
countenance
.
the
mean
employed
by
the
british
cabinet
to
undermine
it
have
recoiled
on
themselves
;
have
given
to
our
national
faculty
a
more
rapid
development
,
and
,
draining
or
diverting
the
precious
metal
from
british
circulation
and
british
vault
,
have
poured
them
into
those
of
the
united
state
.
it
is
a
propitious
consideration
that
an
unavoidable
war
should
have
found
this
seasonable
facility
for
the
contribution
required
to
support
it
.
when
the
public
voice
called
for
war
,
all
knew
,
and
still
know
,
that
without
them
it
could
not
be
carried
on
through
the
period
which
it
might
last
,
and
the
patriotism
,
the
good
sense
,
and
the
manly
spirit
of
our
fellow-citizens
are
pledge
for
the
cheerfulness
with
which
they
will
bear
each
his
share
of
the
common
burden
.
to
render
the
war
short
and
it
success
sure
,
animated
and
systematic
exertion
alone
are
necessary
,
and
the
success
of
our
arm
now
may
long
preserve
our
country
from
the
necessity
of
another
resort
to
them
.
already
have
the
gallant
exploit
of
our
naval
hero
proved
to
the
world
our
inherent
capacity
to
maintain
our
right
on
one
element
.
if
the
reputation
of
our
arm
ha
been
thrown
under
cloud
on
the
other
,
presaging
flash
of
heroic
enterprise
assure
u
that
nothing
is
wanting
to
correspondent
triumph
there
also
but
the
discipline
and
habit
which
are
in
daily
progress
.
