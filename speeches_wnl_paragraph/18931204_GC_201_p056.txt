it
affords
me
signal
pleasure
to
lay
this
parliamentary
resolution
before
the
congress
and
to
express
my
sincere
gratification
that
the
sentiment
of
two
great
and
kindred
nation
is
thus
authoritatively
manifested
in
favor
of
the
rational
and
peaceable
settlement
of
international
quarrel
by
honorable
resort
to
arbitration
.
