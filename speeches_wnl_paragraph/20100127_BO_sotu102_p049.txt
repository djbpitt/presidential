still
,
this
is
a
complex
issue
,
and
the
longer
it
wa
debated
,
the
more
skeptical
people
became
.
i
take
my
share
of
the
blame
for
not
explaining
it
more
clearly
to
the
american
people
.
and
i
know
that
with
all
the
lobbying
and
horse-trading
,
the
process
left
most
american
wondering
,
``
what
's
in
it
for
me
?
