for
several
year
past
we
have
been
compelled
to
strengthen
our
own
national
defense
.
that
ha
created
a
very
large
portion
of
our
treasury
deficit
.
this
year
in
the
light
of
continuing
world
uncertainty
,
i
am
asking
the
congress
for
army
and
navy
increase
which
are
based
not
on
panic
but
on
common
sense
.
they
are
not
a
great
a
enthusiastic
alarmist
seek
.
they
are
not
a
small
a
unrealistic
person
claiming
superior
private
information
would
demand
.
