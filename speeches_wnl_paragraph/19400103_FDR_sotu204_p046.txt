a
will
appear
in
the
annual
budget
tomorrow
,
the
only
important
increase
in
any
part
of
the
budget
is
the
estimate
for
national
defense
.
practically
all
other
important
item
show
a
reduction
.
but
you
know
,
you
ca
n't
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
too
.
therefore
,
in
the
hope
that
we
can
continue
in
these
day
of
increasing
economic
prosperity
to
reduce
the
federal
deficit
,
i
am
asking
the
congress
to
levy
sufficient
additional
tax
to
meet
the
emergency
spending
for
national
defense
.
