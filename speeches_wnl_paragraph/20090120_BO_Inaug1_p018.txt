what
the
cynic
fail
to
understand
is
that
the
ground
ha
shifted
beneath
them—that
the
stale
political
argument
that
have
consumed
u
for
so
long
no
longer
apply
.
the
question
we
ask
today
is
not
whether
our
government
is
too
big
or
too
small
,
but
whether
it
works—whether
it
help
family
find
job
at
a
decent
wage
,
care
they
can
afford
,
a
retirement
that
is
dignified
.
where
the
answer
is
yes
,
we
intend
to
move
forward
.
where
the
answer
is
no
,
program
will
end
.
and
those
of
u
who
manage
the
public
's
dollar
will
be
held
to
account—to
spend
wisely
,
reform
bad
habit
,
and
do
our
business
in
the
light
of
day—because
only
then
can
we
restore
the
vital
trust
between
a
people
and
their
government
.
