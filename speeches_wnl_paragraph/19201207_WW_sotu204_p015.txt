it
is
my
privilege
to
draw
to
the
attention
of
congress
for
very
sympathetic
consideration
the
problem
of
providing
adequate
facility
for
the
care
and
treatment
of
former
member
of
the
military
and
naval
force
who
are
sick
and
disabled
a
the
result
of
their
participation
in
the
war
.
these
heroic
men
can
never
be
paid
in
money
for
the
service
they
patriotically
rendered
the
nation
.
their
reward
will
lie
rather
in
realization
of
the
fact
that
they
vindicated
the
right
of
their
country
and
aided
in
safeguarding
civilization
.
the
nation
's
gratitude
must
be
effectively
revealed
to
them
by
the
most
ample
provision
for
their
medical
care
and
treatment
a
well
a
for
their
vocational
training
and
placement
.
the
time
ha
come
when
a
more
complete
program
can
be
formulated
and
more
satisfactorily
administered
for
their
treatment
and
training
,
and
i
earnestly
urge
that
the
congress
give
the
matter
it
early
consideration
.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
board
for
vocational
education
will
outline
in
their
annual
report
proposal
covering
medical
care
and
rehabilitation
which
i
am
sure
will
engage
your
earnest
study
and
commend
your
most
generous
support
.
