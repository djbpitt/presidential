but
we
must
not
permit
the
many
specific
and
immediate
problem
of
adjustment
connected
with
the
liberation
of
europe
to
delay
the
establishment
of
permanent
machinery
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
.
under
the
threat
of
a
common
danger
,
the
united
nation
joined
together
in
war
to
preserve
their
independence
and
their
freedom
.
they
must
now
join
together
to
make
secure
the
independence
and
freedom
of
all
peace-loving
state
,
so
that
never
again
shall
tyranny
be
able
to
divide
and
conquer
.
