the
history
of
all
the
progress
which
ha
been
made
in
the
civilization
of
the
indian
i
think
will
disclose
the
fact
that
the
beginning
ha
been
religious
teaching
,
followed
by
or
accompanying
secular
education
.
while
the
self-sacrificing
and
pious
men
and
woman
who
have
aided
in
this
good
work
by
their
independent
endeavor
have
for
their
reward
the
beneficent
result
of
their
labor
and
the
consciousness
of
christian
duty
well
performed
,
their
valuable
service
should
be
fully
acknowledged
by
all
who
under
the
law
are
charged
with
the
control
and
management
of
our
indian
ward
.
