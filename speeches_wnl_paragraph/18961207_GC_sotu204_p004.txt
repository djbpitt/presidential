thus
our
people
exhibit
a
patriotic
disposition
which
entitles
them
to
demand
of
those
who
undertake
to
make
and
execute
their
law
such
faithful
and
unselfish
service
in
their
behalf
a
can
only
be
prompted
by
a
serious
appreciation
of
the
trust
and
confidence
which
the
acceptance
of
public
duty
invite
.
