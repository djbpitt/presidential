with
all
good
citizen
the
justice
and
necessity
of
resisting
wrong
and
usurpation
no
longer
to
be
borne
will
sufficiently
outweigh
the
privation
and
sacrifice
inseparable
from
a
state
of
war
.
but
it
is
a
reflection
,
moreover
,
peculiarly
consoling
,
that
,
whilst
war
are
generally
aggravated
by
their
baneful
effect
on
the
internal
improvement
and
permanent
prosperity
of
the
nation
engaged
in
them
,
such
is
the
favored
situation
of
the
united
state
that
the
calamity
of
the
contest
into
which
they
have
been
compelled
to
enter
are
mitigated
by
improvement
and
advantage
of
which
the
contest
itself
is
the
source
.
