completed
result
in

scheme
of
seacoast
defense
and
fortification
entered
upon
eight
year
ago
.
a
large
sum
ha
been
already
expended
,
but
the
cost
of
maintenance
will
be
inconsiderable
a
compared
with
the
expense
of
construction
and
ordnance
.
at
the
end
of
the
current
calendar
year
the
war
department
will
have
nine

to
be
mounted
on
gun

carriage
,
and
seventy-five
12-inch

in
addition
to
the
product
of
the

factory
,
now
