we
will
be
wise
if
we
temper
our
confidence

faith
in
our
nationalstrength

resource
with
the
frank
concession
that
even
these
will
notpermit
u
to
defy
with
impunity
the
inexorable
law
of
finance
and
trade.at
the

,
in

we
shouldbe
free
from
intolerance

and
our
judgment
should
be
unmovedby

unvexed
by
