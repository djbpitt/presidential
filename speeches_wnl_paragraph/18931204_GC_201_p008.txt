the
vexatious
question
of
so-called
legation
asylum
for
offender
against
the
state
and
it
law
wa
presented
anew
in
chile
by
the
unauthorized
action
of
the
late
united
state
minister
in
receiving
into
his
official
residence
two
person
who
had
just
failed
in
an
attempt
at
revolution
and
against
whom
criminal
charge
were
pending
growing
out
of
a
former
abortive
disturbance
.
the
doctrine
of
asylum
a
applied
to
this
case
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
best
precedent
,
and
when
allowed
tends
to
encourage
sedition
and
strife
.
under
no
circumstance
can
the
representative
of
this
government
be
permitted
,
under
the
ill-defined
fiction
of
extraterritoriality
,
to
interrupt
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
country
to
which
they
are
accredited
.
a
temperate
demand
having
been
made
by
the
chilean
government
for
the
correction
of
this
conduct
in
the
instance
mentioned
,
the
minister
wa
instructed
no
longer
to
harbor
the
offender
.
