for
the
first
time
in
our
national
history
a
president
delivers
his
annual
message
to
a
new
congress
within
a
fortnight
of
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
office
.
while
there
is
no
change
in
the
presidency
this
year
,
change
will
occur
in
future
year
.
it
is
my
belief
that
under
this
new
constitutional
practice
,
the
president
should
in
every
fourth
year
,
in
so
far
a
seems
reasonable
,
review
the
existing
state
of
our
national
affair
and
outline
broad
future
problem
,
leaving
specific
recommendation
for
future
legislation
to
be
made
by
the
president
about
to
be
inaugurated
.
