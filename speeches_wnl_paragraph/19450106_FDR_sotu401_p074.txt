the
present
shortage
of
army
nurse
is
reflected
in
undue
strain
on
the
existing
force
.
more
than
a
thousand
nurse
are
now
hospitalized
,
and
part
of
this
is
due
to
overwork
.
the
shortage
is
also
indicated
by
the
fact
that
11
army
hospital
unit
have
been
sent
overseas
without
their
complement
of
nurse
.
at
army
hospital
in
the
united
state
there
is
only
1
nurse
to
26
bed
,
instead
of
the
recommended
1
to
15
bed
.
