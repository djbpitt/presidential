fourth
,
we
need
to
invest
in
the
skill
and
education
of
our
people
.
now
,
this
year
,
we
've
broken
through
the
stalemate
between
left
and
right
by
launching
a
national
competition
to
improve
our
school
.
and
the
idea
here
is
simple
:
instead
of
rewarding
failure
,
we
only
reward
success
.
instead
of
funding
the
status
quo
,
we
only
invest
in
reform
,
reform
that
raise
student
achievement
,
inspires
student
to
excel
in
math
and
science
,
and
turn
around
failing
school
that
steal
the
future
of
too
many
young
american
,
from
rural
community
to
the
inner
city
.
in
the
21st
century
,
the
best
antipoverty
program
around
is
a
world-class
education
.
and
in
this
country
,
the
success
of
our
child
can
not
depend
more
on
where
they
live
than
on
their
potential
.
when
we
renew
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
,
we
will
work
with
congress
to
expand
these
reform
to
all
50
state
.
