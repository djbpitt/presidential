the
civil-service
law
doe
not
prevent
the
discharge
of
the
indolent
or
incompetent
clerk
,
but
it
doe
prevent
supplying
his
place
with
the
unfit
party
worker
.
thus
in
both
these
phase
is
seen
benefit
to
the
public
service
.
and
the
people
who
desire
good
government
,
having
secured
this
statute
,
will
not
relinquish
it
benefit
without
protest
.
nor
are
they
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
it
full
advantage
can
only
be
gained
through
the
complete
good
faith
of
those
having
it
execution
in
charge
.
and
this
they
will
insist
upon
.
