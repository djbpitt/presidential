besides
this
,
the
country
generally
ha
outgrown
our
present
judicial
system
.
if
uniformity
wa
at
all
intended
,
the
system
requires
that
all
the
state
shall
be
accommodated
with
circuit
court
,
attended
by
supreme
judge
,
while
,
in
fact
,
wisconsin
,
minnesota
,
iowa
,
kansa
,
florida
,
texas
,
california
,
and
oregon
have
never
had
any
such
court
.
nor
can
this
well
be
remedied
without
a
change
in
the
system
,
because
the
adding
of
judge
to
the
supreme
court
,
enough
for
the
accommodation
of
all
part
of
the
country
with
circuit
court
,
would
create
a
court
altogether
too
numerous
for
a
judicial
body
of
any
sort
.
and
the
evil
,
if
it
be
one
,
will
increase
a
new
state
come
into
the
union

circuit
court
are
useful
or
they
are
not
useful
.
if
useful
,
no
state
should
be
denied
them
;
if
not
useful
,
no
state
should
have
them
