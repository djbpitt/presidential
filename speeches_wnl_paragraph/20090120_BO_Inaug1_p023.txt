for
we
know
that
our
patchwork
heritage
is
a
strength
,
not
a
weakness
.
we
are
a
nation
of
christian
and
muslim
,
jew
and
hindu
and
non-believers
.
we
are
shaped
by
every
language
and
culture
,
drawn
from
every
end
of
this
earth
;
and
because
we
have
tasted
the
bitter
swill
of
civil
war
and
segregation
,
and
emerged
from
that
dark
chapter
stronger
and
more
united
,
we
can
not
help
but
believe
that
the
old
hatred
shall
someday
pas
;
that
the
line
of
tribe
shall
soon
dissolve
;
that
a
the
world
grows
smaller
,
our
common
humanity
shall
reveal
itself
;
and
that
america
must
play
it
role
in
ushering
in
a
new
era
of
peace
.
