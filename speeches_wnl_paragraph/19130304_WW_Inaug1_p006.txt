we
have
come
now
to
the
sober
second
thought
.
the
scale
of
heedlessnesshave
fallen
from
our
eye
.
we
have
made
up
our
mind
to
square
every
processof
our
national
life
again
with
the
standard
we
so
proudly
set
up
at
thebeginning
and
have
always
carried
at
our
heart
.
our
work
is
a
work
ofrestoration
.
