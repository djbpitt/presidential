the
crowded
condition
of
the
calendar
of
the
supreme
court
,
and
the
delay
to
suitor
and
denial
of
justice
resulting
therefrom
,
ha
been
strongly
urged
upon
the
attention
of
the
congress
,
with
a
plan
for
the
relief
of
the
situation
approved
by
those
well
able
to
judge
of
it
merit
.
while
this
subject
remains
without
effective
consideration
,
many
law
have
been
passed
providing
for
the
holding
of
term
of
inferior
court
at
place
to
suit
the
convenience
of
locality
,
or
to
lay
the
foundation
of
an
application
for
the
erection
of
a
new
public
building
.
