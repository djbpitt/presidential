the
present
mode
of
compensating
united
state
marshal
and
district
attorney
should
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
changed
.
they
are
allowed
to
charge
against
the
government
certain
fee
for
service
,
their
income
being
measured
by
the
amount
of
such
fee
within
a
fixed
limit
a
to
their
annual
aggregate
.
this
is
a
direct
inducement
for
them
to
make
their
fee
in
criminal
case
a
large
a
possible
in
an
effort
to
reach
the
maximum
sum
permitted
.
a
an
entirely
natural
consequence
,
unscrupulous
marshal
are
found
encouraging
frivolous
prosecution
,
arresting
people
on
petty
charge
of
crime
and
transporting
them
to
distant
place
for
examination
and
trial
,
for
the
purpose
of
earning
mileage
and
other
fee
;
and
district
attorney
uselessly
attend
criminal
examination
far
from
their
place
of
residence
for
the
express
purpose
of
swelling
their
account
against
the
government
.
the
actual
expense
incurred
in
these
transaction
are
also
charged
against
the
government
.
