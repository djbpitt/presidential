but
the
evil
ha
come
with
the
good
,
and
much
fine
gold
ha
been
corroded.with
rich
ha
come
inexcusable
waste
.
we
have
squandered
a
great
partof
what
we
might
have
used
,
and
have
not
stopped
to
conserve
the
exceedingbounty
of
nature
,
without
which
our
genius
for
enterprise
would
have
beenworthless
and
impotent
,
scorning
to
be
careful
,
shamefully
prodigal
aswell
a
admirably
efficient
.
we
have
been
proud
of
our
industrial
achievement
,
but
we
have
not
hitherto
stopped
thoughtfully
enough
to
count
the
humancost
,
the
cost
of
life
snuffed
out
,
of
energy
overtaxed
and
broken
,
the
fearful
physical
and
spiritual
cost
to
the
men
and
woman
and
childrenupon
whom
the
dead
weight
and
burden
of
it
all
ha
fallen
pitilessly
theyears
through
.
the
groan
and
agony
of
it
all
had
not
yet
reached
our
ear
,
the
solemn
,
moving
undertone
of
our
life
,
coming
up
out
of
the
mine
andfactories
,
and
out
of
every
home
where
the
struggle
had
it
intimate
andfamiliar
seat
.
with
the
great
government
went
many
deep
secret
thing
whichwe
too
long
delayed
to
look
into
and
scrutinize
with
candid
,
fearless
eyes.the
great
government
we
loved
ha
too
often
been
made
use
of
for
privateand
selfish
purpose
,
and
those
who
used
it
had
forgotten
the
people
.
