and
you
know
what
else
they
share
?
they
share
a
stubborn
resilience
in
the
face
of
adversity
.
after
one
of
the
most
difficult
year
in
our
history
,
they
remain
busy
building
car
and
teaching
kid
,
starting
business
and
going
back
to
school
.
they're
coaching
little
league
and
helping
their
neighbor
.
one
woman
wrote
to
me
and
said
,
``
we
are
strained
but
hopeful
,
struggling
but
encouraged
.
