after
the
war
we
must
maintain
full
employment
with
government
performing
it
peacetime
function
.
this
mean
that
we
must
achieve
a
level
of
demand
and
purchasing
power
by
private
consumers-
farmer
,
businessmen
,
worker
,
professional
men
,
housewives-
which
is
sufficiently
high
to
replace
wartime
government
demand
;
and
it
mean
also
that
we
must
greatly
increase
our
export
trade
above
the
prewar
level
.
