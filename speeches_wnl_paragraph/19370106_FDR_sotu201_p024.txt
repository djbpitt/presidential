sober
second
thought
confirms
most
of
u
in
the
belief
that
the
broad
objective
of
the
national
recovery
act
were
sound
.
we
know
now
that
it
difficulty
arose
from
the
fact
that
it
tried
to
do
too
much
.
for
example
,
it
wa
unwise
to
expect
the
same
agency
to
regulate
the
length
of
working
hour
,
minimum
wage
,
child
labor
and
collective
bargaining
on
the
one
hand
and
the
complicated
question
of
unfair
trade
practice
and
business
control
on
the
other
.
