it
is
a
significant
fact
that
four
of
the
five
country
composing
the
latin
union
mentioned
in
our
coinage
act
,
embarrassed
with
their
silver
currency
,
have
just
completed
an
agreement
among
themselves
that
no
more
silver
shall
be
coined
by
their
respective
government
and
that
such
a
ha
been
already
coined
and
in
circulation
shall
be
redeemed
in
gold
by
the
country
of
it
coinage
.
the
resort
to
this
expedient
by
these
country
may
well
arrest
the
attention
of
those
who
suppose
that
we
can
succeed
without
shock
or
injury
in
the
attempt
to
circulate
upon
it
merit
all
the
silver
we
may
coin
under
the
provision
of
our
silver-coinage
act
.
