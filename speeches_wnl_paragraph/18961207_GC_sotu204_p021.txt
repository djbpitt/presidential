they
view
with
wonder
and
admiration
the
cheerful
resolution
with
which
vast
body
of
men
are
sent
across
thousand
of
mile
of
ocean
and
an
enormous
debt
accumulated
that
the
costly
possession
of
the
gem
of
the
antilles
may
still
hold
it
place
in
the
spanish
crown
.
and
yet
neither
the
government
nor
the
people
of
the
united
state
have
shut
their
eye
to
the
course
of
event
in
cuba
or
have
failed
to
realize
the
existence
of
conceded
grievance
which
have
led
to
the
present
revolt
from
the
authority
of
spain
--
grievance
recognized
by
the
queen
regent
and
by
the
cortes
,
voiced
by
the
most
patriotic
and
enlightened
of
spanish
statesman
,
without
regard
to
party
,
and
demonstrated
by
reform
proposed
by
the
executive
and
approved
by
the
legislative
branch
of
the
spanish
government
.
it
is
in
the
assumed
temper
and
disposition
of
the
spanish
government
to
remedy
these
grievance
,
fortified
by
indication
of
influential
public
opinion
in
spain
,
that
this
government
ha
hoped
to
discover
the
most
promising
and
effective
mean
of
composing
the
present
strife
with
honor
and
advantage
to
spain
and
with
the
achievement
of
all
the
reasonable
object
of
the
insurrection
.
