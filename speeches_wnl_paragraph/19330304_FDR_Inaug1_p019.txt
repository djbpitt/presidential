action
in
this
image
and
to
this
end
is
feasible
under
the
form
of
government
which
we
have
inherited
from
our
ancestor
.
our
constitution
is
so
simple
and
practical
that
it
is
possible
always
to
meet
extraordinary
need
by
change
in
emphasis
and
arrangement
without
loss
of
essential
form
.
that
is
why
our
constitutional
system
ha
proved
itself
the
most
superbly
enduring
political
mechanism
the
modern
world
ha
produced
.
it
ha
met
every
stress
of
vast
expansion
of
territory
,
of
foreign
war
,
of
bitter
internal
strife
,
of
world
relation
.
