we
should
follow
the
example
of
a
police
officer
named
brian
murphy
.
when
a
gunman
opened
fire
on
a
sikh
temple
in
wisconsin
and
brian
wa
the
first
to
arriveâ€”and
he
did
not
consider
his
own
safety
.
he
fought
back
until
help
arrived
and
ordered
his
fellow
officer
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
american
worshiping
inside
,
even
a
he
lay
bleeding
from
12
bullet
wound
.
and
when
asked
how
he
did
that
,
brian
said
,
``
that
's
just
the
way
we
're
made
.
''
