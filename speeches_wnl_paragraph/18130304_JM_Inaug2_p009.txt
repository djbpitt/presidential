they
have
not
,
it
is
true
,
taken
into
their
own
hand
the
hatchet
and
the
knife
,
devoted
to
indiscriminate
massacre
,
but
they
have
let
loose
the
savage
armed
with
these
cruel
instrument
;
have
allured
them
into
their
service
,
and
carried
them
to
battle
by
their
side
,
eager
to
glut
their
savage
thirst
with
the
blood
of
the
vanquished
and
to
finish
the
work
of
torture
and
death
on
maimed
and
defenseless
captive
.
and
,
what
wa
never
before
seen
,
british
commander
have
extorted
victory
over
the
unconquerable
valor
of
our
troop
by
presenting
to
the
sympathy
of
their
chief
captive
awaiting
massacre
from
their
savage
associate
.
and
now
we
find
them
,
in
further
contempt
of
the
mode
of
honorable
warfare
,
supplying
the
place
of
a
conquering
force
by
attempt
to
disorganize
our
political
society
,
to
dismember
our
confederated
republic
.
happily
,
like
others
,
these
will
recoil
on
the
author
;
but
they
mark
the
degenerate
counsel
from
which
they
emanate
,
and
if
they
did
not
belong
to
a
sense
of
unexampled
inconsistency
might
excite
the
greater
wonder
a
proceeding
from
a
government
which
founded
the
very
war
in
which
it
ha
been
so
long
engaged
on
a
charge
against
the
disorganizing
and
insurrectional
policy
of
it
adversary
.
