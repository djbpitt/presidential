i
believe
our
present
tariff
law
,
if
allowed
a
fair
opportunity
,
will
in
the
near
future
yield
a
revenue
which
,
with
reasonably
economical
expenditure
,
will
overcome
all
deficiency
.
in
the
meantime
no
deficit
that
ha
occurred
or
may
occur
need
excite
or
disturb
u
.
to
meet
any
such
deficit
we
have
in
the
treasury
in
addition
to
a
gold
reserve
of
one
hundred
million
a
surplus
of
more
than
$
128,000,000
applicable
to
the
payment
of
the
expense
of
the
government
,
and
which
must
,
unless
expended
for
that
purpose
,
remain
a
useless
hoard
,
or
,
if
not
extravagantly
wasted
,
must
in
any
event
be
perverted
from
the
purpose
of
it
exaction
from
our
people
.
the
payment
,
therefore
,
of
any
deficiency
in
the
revenue
from
this
fund
is
nothing
more
than
it
proper
and
legitimate
use
.
the
government
thus
applying
a
surplus
fortunately
in
it
treasury
to
the
payment
of
expense
not
met
by
it
current
revenue
is
not
at
all
to
be
likened
to
a
man
living
beyond
his
income
and
thus
incurring
debt
or
encroaching
on
his
principal
.
