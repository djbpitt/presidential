the
relation
of
the
government
with
the
indian
tribe
have
been
greatly
disturbed
by
the
insurrection
,
especially
in
the
southern
superintendency
and
in
that
of
new
mexico
.
the
indian
country
south
of
kansa
is
in
the
possession
of
insurgent
from
texas
and
arkansas
.
the
agent
of
the
united
state
appointed
since
the
4th
of
march
for
this
superintendency
have
been
unable
to
reach
their
post
,
while
the
most
of
those
who
were
in
office
before
that
time
have
espoused
the
insurrectionary
cause
,
and
assume
to
exercise
the
power
of
agent
by
virtue
of
commission
from
the
insurrectionist
.
it
ha
been
stated
in
the
public
press
that
a
portion
of
those
indian
have
been
organized
a
a
military
force
and
are
attached
to
the
army
of
the
insurgent
.
although
the
government
ha
no
official
information
upon
this
subject
,
letter
have
been
written
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affair
by
several
prominent
chief
giving
assurance
of
their
loyalty
to
the
united
state
and
expressing
a
wish
for
the
presence
of
federal
troop
to
protect
them
.
it
is
believed
that
upon
the
repossession
of
the
country
by
the
federal
force
the
indian
will
readily
cease
all
hostile
demonstration
and
resume
their
former
relation
to
the
government
.
