a
the
war
wa
just
in
it
origin
and
necessary
and
noble
in
it
object
,
we
can
reflect
with
a
proud
satisfaction
that
in
carrying
it
on
no
principle
of
justice
or
honor
,
no
usage
of
civilized
nation
,
no
precept
of
courtesy
or
humanity
,
have
been
infringed
.
the
war
ha
been
waged
on
our
part
with
scrupulous
regard
to
all
these
obligation
,
and
in
a
spirit
of
liberality
which
wa
never
surpassed
.
