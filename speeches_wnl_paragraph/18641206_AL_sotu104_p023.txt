desire
,
however
,
to
be
understood
while
making
this
statement
that
the
colonial
authority
of
canada
are
not
deemed
to
be
intentionally
unjust
or
unfriendly
toward
the
united
state
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
that
,
with
the
approval
of
the
imperial
government
,
they
will
take
the
necessary
measure
to
prevent
new
incursion
across
the
border
.
