to
the
security
of
a
free
constitution
it
contributes
in
various
way
-
by
convincing
those
who
are
intrusted
with
the
public
administration
that
every
valuable
end
of
government
is
best
answered
by
the
enlightened
confidence
of
the
people
,
and
by
teaching
the
people
themselves
to
know
and
to
value
their
own
right
;
to
discern
and
provide
against
invasion
of
them
;
to
distinguish
between
oppression
and
the
necessary
exercise
of
lawful
authority
;
between
burthen
proceeding
from
a
disregard
to
their
convenience
and
those
resulting
from
the
inevitable
exigency
of
society
;
to
discriminate
the
spirit
of
liberty
from
that
of
licentiousness
-
cherishing
the
first
,
avoiding
the
last
-
and
uniting
a
speedy
but
temperate
vigilance
against
encroachment
,
with
an
inviolable
respect
to
the
law
.
