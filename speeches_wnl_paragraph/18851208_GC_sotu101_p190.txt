i
approve
the
recommendation
of
the
postmaster-general
to
reduce
the
charge
on
domestic
money
order
of
$
5
and
le
from
8
to
5
cent
.
this
change
will
materially
aid
those
of
our
people
who
most
of
all
avail
themselves
of
this
instrumentality
,
but
to
whom
the
element
of
cheapness
is
of
the
greatest
importance
.
with
this
reduction
the
system
would
still
remain
self-supporting
.
