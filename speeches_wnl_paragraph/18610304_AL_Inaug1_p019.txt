i
therefore
consider
that
,
in
view
of
the
constitution
and
the
law
,
the
union
is
unbroken
;
and
to
the
extent
of
my
ability
i
shall
take
care
,
a
the
constitution
itself
expressly
enjoins
upon
me
,
that
the
law
of
the
union
be
faithfully
executed
in
all
the
state
.
doing
this
i
deem
to
be
only
a
simple
duty
on
my
part
;
and
i
shall
perform
it
so
far
a
practicable
,
unless
my
rightful
master
,
the
american
people
,
shall
withhold
the
requisite
mean
,
or
in
some
authoritative
manner
direct
the
contrary
.
i
trust
this
will
not
be
regarded
a
a
menace
,
but
only
a
the
declared
purpose
of
the
union
that
it
will
constitutionally
defend
and
maintain
itself
.
