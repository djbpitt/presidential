the
secretary
is
considering
and
will
formulate
during
the
coming
winter
a
plan
for
laying
up
ship
in
reserve
,
thereby
largely
reducing
the
cost
of
maintaining
our
vessel
afloat
.
this
plan
contemplates
that
battle
ship
,
torpedo
boat
,
and
such
of
the
cruiser
a
are
not
needed
for
active
service
at
sea
shall
be
kept
in
reserve
with
skeleton
crew
on
board
to
keep
them
in
condition
,
cruising
only
enough
to
insure
the
efficiency
of
the
ship
and
their
crew
in
time
of
activity
.
