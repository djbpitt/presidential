it
is
not
in
despair
that
i
paint
you
that
picture
.
i
paint
it
for
you
in
hopeâ€”because
the
nation
,
seeing
and
understanding
the
injustice
in
it
,
proposes
to
paint
it
out
.
we
are
determined
to
make
every
american
citizen
the
subject
of
his
country
's
interest
and
concern
;
and
we
will
never
regard
any
faithful
,
law-abiding
group
within
our
border
a
superfluous
.
the
test
of
our
progress
is
not
whether
we
add
more
to
the
abundance
of
those
who
have
much
;
it
is
whether
we
provide
enough
for
those
who
have
too
little
.
