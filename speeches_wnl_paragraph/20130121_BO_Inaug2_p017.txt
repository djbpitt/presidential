we
,
the
people
,
still
believe
that
our
obligation
a
american
are
not
just
to
ourselves
,
but
to
all
posterity
.
we
will
respond
to
the
threat
of
climate
change
,
knowing
that
the
failure
to
do
so
would
betray
our
child
and
future
generation
.
some
may
still
deny
the
overwhelming
judgment
of
science
,
but
none
can
avoid
the
devastating
impact
of
raging
fire
and
crippling
drought
and
more
powerful
storm
.
