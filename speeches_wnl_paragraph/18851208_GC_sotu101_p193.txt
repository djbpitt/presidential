the
rate
of
sea
and
inland
postage
which
wa
proffered
under
another
statute
clearly
appears
to
be
a
fair
compensation
for
the
desired
service
,
being
three
time
the
price
necessary
to
secure
transportation
by
other
vessel
upon
any
route
,
and
much
beyond
the
charge
made
to
private
person
for
service
not
le
burdensome
.
