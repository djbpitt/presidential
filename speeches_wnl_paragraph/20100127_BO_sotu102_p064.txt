now
,
to
do
that
,
we
have
to
recognize
that
we
face
more
than
a
deficit
of
dollar
right
now
.
we
face
a
deficit
of
trust
,
deep
and
corrosive
doubt
about
how
washington
work
that
have
been
growing
for
year
.
to
close
that
credibility
gap
,
we
have
to
take
action
on
both
end
of
pennsylvania
avenue
to
end
the
outsized
influence
of
lobbyist
,
to
do
our
work
openly
,
to
give
our
people
the
government
they
deserve
.
