and
that
's
why
i
'm
sending
this
congress
a
plan
that
give
every
responsible
homeowner
the
chance
to
save
about
$
3,000
a
year
on
their
mortgage
by
refinancing
at
historically
low
rate
.
no
more
redtape
.
no
more
runaround
from
the
bank
.
a
small
fee
on
the
largest
financial
institution
will
ensure
that
it
wo
n't
add
to
the
deficit
and
will
give
those
bank
that
were
rescued
by
taxpayer
a
chance
to
repay
a
deficit
of
trust
.
