the
fact
that
the
class
which
graduate
next
year
is
an
unusually
large
one
ha
constrained
me
to
decline
to
make
appointment
to
second
lieutenancy
in
the
army
from
civil
life
,
so
that
such
vacancy
a
exist
in
these
place
may
be
reserved
for
such
graduate
;
and
yet
it
is
not
probable
that
there
will
be
enough
vacancy
to
provide
position
for
them
all
when
they
leave
the
military
school
.
under
the
prevailing
law
and
usage
those
not
thus
assigned
to
duty
never
actively
enter
the
military
service
.
it
is
suggested
that
the
law
on
this
subject
be
changed
so
that
such
of
these
young
men
a
are
not
at
once
assigned
to
duty
after
graduation
may
be
retained
a
second
lieutenant
in
the
army
if
they
desire
it
,
subject
to
assignment
when
opportunity
occurs
,
and
under
proper
rule
a
to
priority
of
selection
.
