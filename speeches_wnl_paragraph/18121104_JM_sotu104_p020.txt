the
same
insufficiency
ha
been
experienced
in
the
provision
for
volunteer
made
by
an
act
of
the
last
session
.
the
recompense
for
the
service
required
in
this
case
is
still
le
attractive
than
in
the
other
,
and
although
patriotism
alone
ha
sent
into
the
field
some
valuable
corp
of
that
description
,
those
alone
who
can
afford
the
sacrifice
can
be
reasonably
expected
to
yield
to
that
impulse
.
