the
productiveness
of
the
public
revenue
hitherto
ha
continued
to
equal
the
anticipation
which
were
formed
of
it
,
but
it
is
not
expected
to
prove
commensurate
with
all
the
object
which
have
been
suggested
.
some
auxiliary
provision
will
therefore
,
it
is
presumed
,
be
requisite
,
and
it
is
hoped
that
these
may
be
made
consistently
with
a
due
regard
to
the
convenience
of
our
citizen
,
who
can
not
but
be
sensible
of
the
true
wisdom
of
encountering
a
small
present
addition
to
their
contribution
to
obviate
a
future
accumulation
of
burthen
.
