they
have
therefore
impatiently
reverted
to
the
old
belief
in
the
law
of
the
sword
,
or
to
the
fantastic
conception
that
they
,
and
they
alone
,
are
chosen
to
fulfill
a
mission
and
that
all
the
others
among
the
billion
and
a
half
of
human
being
in
the
world
must
and
shall
learn
from
and
be
subject
to
them
.
