which
brings
me
back
to
where
i
began
.
those
of
u
who
've
been
sent
here
to
serve
can
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
the
service
of
our
troop
.
when
you
put
on
that
uniform
,
it
doe
n't
matter
if
you
're
black
or
white
,
asian
,
latino
,
native
american
;
conservative
,
liberal
;
rich
,
poor
;
gay
,
straight
.
when
you
're
marching
into
battle
,
you
look
out
for
the
person
next
to
you
or
the
mission
fails
.
when
you
're
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
,
you
rise
or
fall
a
one
unit
,
serving
one
nation
,
leaving
no
one
behind
.
