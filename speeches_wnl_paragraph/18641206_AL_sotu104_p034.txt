to
be
acceptable
to
capitalist
and
to
the

day
of
november
584
national
bank
had
been
organized
,
a
considerable
number
of

were
conversion
from
state
bank
.
change
from
state
system
to
the
national
system
are
rapidly
taking
place
,
and
it
is
hoped
that
very
soon
there
will
be
in
the
united
state
no
bank
of
issue
not
authorized
by
congress
and
no
bank-note
circulation
not
secured
by
the
government

will
derive
great
benefit
from

create
a
reliable

permanent
influence
in

and
protect
the
people
against

in
the
use
of
paper

further
legislation
is
advisable
for
the
suppression
of
state-bank
issue
it
will
be
for
congress
to
determine
.
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
treasury
can
not
be
satisfactorily
conducted
unless
the
government
can
exercise
a
restraining
power
over
the
bank-note
circulation
of
the
country
.

report
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
accompanying
document
will
detail
the
campaign
of
the
army
in
the
field
since
the
date
of
the
last
annual
message
,
and
also
the
operation
of
the
several
administrative
bureau
of
the
war
department
during
the
last
year
.
it
will
also
specify
the

deemed
essential
for
the
national
defense
and
to
keep
