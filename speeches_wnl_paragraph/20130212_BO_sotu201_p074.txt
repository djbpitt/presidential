we
also
know
that
progress
in
the
most
impoverished
part
of
our
world
enriches
u
all
,
not
only
because
it
creates
new
market
,
more
stable
order
in
certain
region
of
the
world
,
but
also
because
it
's
the
right
thing
to
do
.
in
many
place
,
people
live
on
little
more
than
a
dollar
a
day
.
so
the
united
state
will
join
with
our
ally
to
eradicate
such
extreme
poverty
in
the
next
two
decade
by
connecting
more
people
to
the
global
economy
,
by
empowering
woman
,
by
giving
our
young
and
brightest
mind
new
opportunity
to
serve
and
helping
community
to
feed
and
power
and
educate
themselves
,
by
saving
the
world
's
child
from
preventable
death
,
and
by
realizing
the
promise
of
an
aids-free
generation
,
which
is
within
our
reach
.
