in
your
hand
,
my
dissatisfied
fellow-countrymen
,
and
not
in
mine
,
is
the
momentous
issue
of
civil
war
.
the
government
will
not
assail
you
.
you
can
have
no
conflict
without
being
yourselves
the
aggressor
.
you
have
no
oath
registered
in
heaven
to
destroy
the
government
,
while
i
shall
have
the
most
solemn
one
to
``
preserve
,
protect
,
and
defend
it
.
