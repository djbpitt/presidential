the
congress
,
of
course
,
must
rightly
keep
itself
informed
at
all
time
of
the
progress
of
the

however
,
there
is
certain
information
,
a
the
congress
itself
will
readily
recognize
,
which
,
in
the
interest
of
our
own
security
and
those
of
the
nation
that
we
are
supporting
,
must
of
need
be
kept
in
confidence
