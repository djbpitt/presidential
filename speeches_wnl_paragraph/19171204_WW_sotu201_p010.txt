success
by
skill
,
by
industry
,
by
knowledge
,
by
enterprise
we
did
not
grudge
or
oppose
,
but
admired
,
rather
.
she
had
built
up
for
herself
a
real
empire
of
trade
and
influence
,
secured
by
the
peace
of
the
world
.
we
were
content
to
abide
the
rivalry
of
manufacture
,
science
,
and
commerce
that
were
involved
for
u
in
her
success
and

fall
a
we
had
or
did
not
have
the
brain
and
the
initiative
to
surpass
her
.
but
at
the
moment
when
she
had
conspicuously
won
her
triumph
of
peace
she
threw
them
away
,
to
establish
in
their
stead
what
the
world
will
no
longer
permit
to
be
established
,
military
and
political
domination
by

,
by

oust

she
could
not
excel
the
rival
she
most
feared
and
hated
.
the
peace
we
make
must
remedy
that
wrong
.
it
must
deliver
the
once
fair
land
and
happy
people
of
belgium
and
northern
france
from
the
prussian
conquest
and
the
prussian
menace
,
but
it
must
also
deliver
the
people
of
austria-hungary
,
the
people
of
the
balkan
,
and
the
people
of
turkey
,
alike
in
europe
and
in
asia
,
from
the
impudent
and
alien
dominion
of
the
prussian
military
and
commercial
autocracy
.
