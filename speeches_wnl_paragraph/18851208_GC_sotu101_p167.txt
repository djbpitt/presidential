these
desertion
might
also
be
reduced
by
lessening
the
term
of
first
enlistment
,
thus
allowing
a
discontented
recruit
to
contemplate
a
nearer
discharge
and
the
army
a
profitable
riddance
.
after
one
term
of
service
a
reenlistment
would
be
quite
apt
to
secure
a
contented
recruit
and
a
good
soldier
.
