there
are
men
who
doubt
this
.
there
are
men
who
believe
that
democracy
,
a
a
form
of
government
and
a
frame
of
life
,
is
limited
or
measured
by
a
kind
of
mystical
and
artificial
fate
that
,
for
some
unexplained
reason
,
tyranny
and
slavery
have
become
the
surging
wave
of
the
futureâ€”and
that
freedom
is
an
ebbing
tide
.
