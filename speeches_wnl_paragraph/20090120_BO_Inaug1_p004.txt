that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
crisis
is
now
well
understood
.
our
nation
is
at
war
,
against
a
far-reaching
network
of
violence
and
hatred
.
our
economy
is
badly
weakened
,
a
consequence
of
greed
and
irresponsibility
on
the
part
of
some
,
but
also
our
collective
failure
to
make
hard
choice
and
prepare
the
nation
for
a
new
age
.
home
have
been
lost
;
job
shed
;
business
shuttered
.
our
health
care
is
too
costly
;
our
school
fail
too
many
;
and
each
day
brings
further
evidence
that
the
way
we
use
energy
strengthen
our
adversary
and
threaten
our
planet
.
