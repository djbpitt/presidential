we
know
the
process
will
be
messy
,
and
we
can
not
presume
to
dictate
the
course
of
change
in
country
like
egypt
,
but
we
can
and
will
insist
on
respect
for
the
fundamental
right
of
all
people
.
we
'll
keep
the
pressure
on
a
syrian
regime
that
ha
murdered
it
own
people
and
support
opposition
leader
that
respect
the
right
of
every
syrian
.
and
we
will
stand
steadfast
with
israel
in
pursuit
of
security
and
a
lasting
peace
.
