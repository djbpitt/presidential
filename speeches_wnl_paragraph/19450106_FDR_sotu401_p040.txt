what
the
allied
force
in
italy
are
doing
is
a
well-considered
part
in
our
strategy
in
europe
,
now
aimed
at
only
one
objective
—the
total
defeat
of
the
german
.
these
valiant
force
in
italy
are
continuing
to
keep
a
substantial
portion
of
the
german
army
under
constant
pressure—including
some
20
first-line
german
division
and
the
necessary
supply
and
transport
and
replacement
troops—all
of
which
our
enemy
need
so
badly
elsewhere
.
