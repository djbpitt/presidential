conscious
of
this
backwardness
and
neglect
on
our
part
,
the
congress
recently
authorized
the
creation
of
a
special
commission
to
study
the
various
system
of
rural
credit
which
have
been
put
into
operation
in
europe
,
and
this
commission
is
already
prepared
to
report
.
it
report
ought
to
make
it
easier
for
u
to
determine
what
method
will
be
best
suited
to
our
own
farmer
.
i
hope
and
believe
that
the
committee
of
the
senate
and
house
will
address
themselves
to
this
matter
with
the
most
fruitful
result
,
and
i
believe
that
the
study
and
recently
formed
plan
of
the
department
of
agriculture
may
be
made
to
serve
them
very
greatly
in
their
work
of
framing
appropriate
and
adequate
legislation
.
it
would
be
indiscreet
and
presumptuous
in
anyone
to
dogmatize
upon
so
great
and
many-sided
a
question
,
but
i
feel
confident
that
common
counsel
will
produce
the
result
we
must
all
desire
.
