it
should
be
added
that
it
can
not
be
reasonably
assumed
that
the
hitherto
expectant
attitude
of
the
united
state
will
be
indefinitely
maintained
.
while
we
are
anxious
to
accord
all
due
respect
to
the
sovereignty
of
spain
,
we
can
not
view
the
pending
conflict
in
all
it
feature
and
properly
apprehend
our
inevitably
close
relation
to
it
and
it
possible
result
without
considering
that
by
the
course
of
event
we
may
be
drawn
into
such
an
unusual
and
unprecedented
condition
a
will
fix
a
limit
to
our
patient
waiting
for
spain
to
end
the
contest
,
either
alone
and
in
her
own
way
or
with
our
friendly
cooperation
.
