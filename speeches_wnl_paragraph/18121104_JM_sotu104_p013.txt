although
a
repeal
of
the
order
susceptible
of
explanation
meeting
the
view
of
this
government
had
taken
place
before
this
pacific
advance
wa
communicated
to
that
of
great
britain
,
the
advance
wa
declined
from
an
avowed
repugnance
to
a
suspension
of
the
practice
of
impressment
during
the
armistice
,
and
without
any
intimation
that
the
arrangement
proposed
wrt
sea
men
would
be
accepted
.
whether
the
subsequent
communication
from
this
government
,
affording
an
occasion
for
reconsidering
the
subject
on
the
part
of
great
britain
,
will
be
viewed
in
a
more
favorable
light
or
received
in
a
more
accommodating
spirit
remains
to
be
known
.
it
would
be
unwise
to
relax
our
measure
in
any
respect
on
a
presumption
of
such
a
result
.
