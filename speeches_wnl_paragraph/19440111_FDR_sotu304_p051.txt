experience
in
other
democratic
nation
at
warâ€”britain
,
canada
,
australia
,
and
new
zealand-
ha
shown
that
the
very
existence
of
national
service
make
unnecessary
the
widespread
use
of
compulsory
power
.
national
service
ha
proven
to
be
a
unifying
moral
force
based
on
an
equal
and
comprehensive
legal
obligation
of
all
people
in
a
nation
at
war
.
