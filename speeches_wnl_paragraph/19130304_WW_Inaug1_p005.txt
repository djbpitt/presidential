at
last
a
vision
ha
been
vouchsafed
u
of
our
life
a
a
whole
.
we
seethe
bad
with
the
good
,
the
debased
and
decadent
with
the
sound
and
vital.with
this
vision
we
approach
new
affair
.
our
duty
is
to
cleanse
,
to
reconsider
,
to
restore
,
to
correct
the
evil
without
impairing
the
good
,
to
purify
andhumanize
every
process
of
our
common
life
without
weakening
or
sentimentalizingit
.
there
ha
been
something
crude
and
heartless
and
unfeeling
in
our
hasteto
succeed
and
be
great
.
our
thought
ha
been
``
let
every
man
look
out
forhimself
,
let
every
generation
look
out
for
itself
,
''
while
we
reared
giantmachinery
which
made
it
impossible
that
any
but
those
who
stood
at
thelevers
of
control
should
have
a
chance
to
look
out
for
themselves
.
we
hadnot
forgotten
our
moral
.
we
remembered
well
enough
that
we
had
set
upa
policy
which
wa
meant
to
serve
the
humblest
a
well
a
the
most
powerful
,
with
an
eye
single
to
the
standard
of
justice
and
fair
play
,
and
rememberedit
with
pride
.
but
we
were
very
heedless
and
in
a
hurry
to
be
great
.
