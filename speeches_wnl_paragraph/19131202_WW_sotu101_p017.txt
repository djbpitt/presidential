but
the
construction
of
railway
is
only
the
first
step
;
is
only
thrusting
in
the
key
to
the
storehouse
and
throwing
back
the
lock
and
opening
the
door
.
how
the
tempting
resource
of
the
country
are
to
be
exploited
is
another
matter
,
to
which
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
from
time
to
time
calling
your
attention
,
for
it
is
a
policy
which
must
be
worked
out
by
well-considered
stage
,
not
upon
theory
,
but
upon
line
of
practical
expediency
.
it
is
part
of
our
general
problem
of
conservation
.
we
have
a
freer
hand
in
working
out
the
problem
in
alaska
than
in
the
state
of
the
union
;
and
yet
the
principle
and
object
are
the
same
,
wherever
we
touch
it
.
we
must
use
the
resource
of
the
country
,
not
lock
them
up
.
there
need
be
no
conflict
or
jealousy
a
between
state
and
federal
authority
,
for
there
can
be
no
essential
difference
of
purpose
between
them
.
the
resource
in
question
must
be
used
,
but
not
destroyed
or
wasted
;
used
,
but
not
monopolized
upon
any
narrow
idea
of
individual
right
a
against
the
abiding
interest
of
community
.
that
a
policy
can
be
worked
out
by
conference
and
concession
which
will
release
these
resource
and
yet
not
jeopard
or
dissipate
them
,
i
for
one
have
no
doubt
;
and
it
can
be
done
on
line
of
regulation
which
need
be
no
le
acceptable
to
the
people
and
government
of
the
state
concerned
than
to
the
people
and
government
of
the
nation
at
large
,
whose
heritage
these
resource
are
.
we
must
bend
our
counsel
to
this
end
.
a
common
purpose
ought
to
make
agreement
easy
.
