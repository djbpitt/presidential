now
,
i
recognize
that
people
watching
tonight
have
differing
view
about
tax
and
debt
,
energy
and
health
care
.
but
no
matter
what
party
they
belong
to
,
i
bet
most
american
are
thinking
the
same
thing
right
about
now
:
nothing
will
get
done
in
washington
this
year
or
next
year
or
maybe
even
the
year
after
that
,
because
washington
is
broken
.
