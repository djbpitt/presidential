in
brief
,
the
immediate
legislative
need
of
the
time
is
the
removal
of
all
obstacle
to
the
realization
of
the
best
ambition
of
our
people
in
their
several
class
of
employment
and
the
strengthening
of
all
instrumentality
by
.
which
difficulty
are
to
be
met
and
removed
and
justice
dealt
out
,
whether
by
law
or
by
some
form
of
mediation
and
conciliation
.
i
do
not
feel
it
to
be
my
privilege
at
present
to
,
suggest
the
detailed
and
particular
method
by
which
these
object
may
be
attained
,
but
i
have
faith
that
the
inquiry
of
your
several
committee
will
discover
the
way
and
the
method
.
