among
the
vicissitude
incident
to
life
,
no
event
could
have
filled
me
with
greater
anxiety
than
that
of
which
the
notification
wa
transmitted
by
your
order
,
and
received
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
present
month
.
on
the
one
hand
,
i
wa
summoned
by
my
country
,
whose
voice
i
can
never
hear
but
with
veneration
and
love
,
from
a
retreat
which
i
had
chosen
with
the
fondest
predilection
,
and
,
in
my
flattering
hope
,
with
an
immutable
decision
,
a
the
asylum
of
my
declining
year
:
a
retreat
which
wa
rendered
every
day
more
necessary
a
well
a
more
dear
to
me
,
by
the
addition
of
habit
to
inclination
,
and
of
frequent
interruption
in
my
health
to
the
gradual
waste
committed
on
it
by
time
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
magnitude
and
difficulty
of
the
trust
to
which
the
voice
of
my
country
called
me
,
being
sufficient
to
awaken
in
the
wisest
and
most
experienced
of
her
citizen
,
a
distrustful
scrutiny
into
his
qualification
,
could
not
but
overwhelm
with
dispondence
,
one
,
who
,
inheriting
inferior
endowment
from
nature
and
unpractised
in
the
duty
of
civil
administration
,
ought
to
be
peculiarly
conscious
of
his
own
deficencies
.
in
this
conflict
of
emotion
,
all
i
dare
aver
,
is
,
that
it
ha
been
my
faithful
study
to
collect
my
duty
from
a
just
appreciation
of
every
circumstance
,
by
which
it
might
be
affected
.
all
i
dare
hope
,
is
,
that
,
if
in
executing
this
task
i
have
been
too
much
swayed
by
a
grateful
remembrance
of
former
instance
,
or
by
an
affectionate
sensibility
to
this
transcendent
proof
,
of
the
confidence
of
my
fellow-citizens
;
and
have
thence
too
little
consulted
my
incapacity
a
well
a
disinclination
for
the
weighty
and
untried
care
before
me
;
my
error
will
be
palliated
by
the
motif
which
misled
me
,
and
it
consequence
be
judged
by
my
country
,
with
some
share
of
the
partiality
in
which
they
originated
.
