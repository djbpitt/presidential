we
have
a
supply
of
natural
gas
that
can
last
america
nearly
100
year
.
and
my
administration
will
take
every
possible
action
to
safely
develop
this
energy
.
expert
believe
this
will
support
more
than
600,000
job
by
the
end
of
the
decade
.
and
i'm
requiring
all
company
that
drill
for
gas
on
public
land
to
disclose
the
chemical
they
use
.
because
america
will
develop
this
resource
without
putting
the
health
and
safety
of
our
citizen
at
risk
.
