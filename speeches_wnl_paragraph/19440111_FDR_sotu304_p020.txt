the
fact
is
the
very
contrary
.
it
ha
been
shown
time
and
again
that
if
the
standard
of
living
of
any
country
go
up
,
so
doe
it
purchasing
power-
and
that
such
a
rise
encourages
a
better
standard
of
living
in
neighboring
country
with
whom
it
trade
.
that
is
just
plain
common
senseâ€”and
it
is
the
kind
of
plain
common
sense
that
provided
the
basis
for
our
discussion
at
moscow
,
cairo
,
and
teheran
.
