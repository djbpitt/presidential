the
worst
that
can
happen
to
the
detriment
of
the
german
people
is
this
,
that
if
they
should
still
,
after
the
war
is
over
,
continue
to
be
obliged
to
live
under
ambitious
and
intriguing
master
interested
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
world
,
men
or
class
of
men
whom
the
other
people
of
the
world
could
not
trust
,
it
might
be
impossible
to
admit
them
to
the
partnership
of
nation
which
must
henceforth
guarantee
the
world
's
peace
.
that
partnership
must
be
a
partnership
of
people
,
not
a
mere
partnership
of
government
.
it
might
be
impossible
,
also
,
in
such
untoward
circumstance
,
to
admit
germany
to
the
free
economic
intercourse
which
must
inevitably
spring
out
of
the
other
partnership
of
a
real
peace
.
but
there
would
be
no
aggression
in
that
;
and
such
a
situation
,
inevitable
because
of
distrust
,
would
in
the
very
nature
of
thing
sooner
or
later
cure
itself
,
by
process
which
would
assuredly
set
in
.
