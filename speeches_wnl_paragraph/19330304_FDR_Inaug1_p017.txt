if
i
read
the
temper
of
our
people
correctly
,
we
now
realize
a
we
have
never
realized
before
our
interdependence
on
each
other
;
that
we
can
not
merely
take
but
we
must
give
a
well
;
that
if
we
are
to
go
forward
,
we
must
move
a
a
trained
and
loyal
army
willing
to
sacrifice
for
the
good
of
a
common
discipline
,
because
without
such
discipline
no
progress
is
made
,
no
leadership
becomes
effective
.
we
are
,
i
know
,
ready
and
willing
to
submit
our
life
and
property
to
such
discipline
,
because
it
make
possible
a
leadership
which
aim
at
a
larger
good
.
this
i
propose
to
offer
,
pledging
that
the
larger
purpose
will
bind
upon
u
all
a
a
sacred
obligation
with
a
unity
of
duty
hitherto
evoked
only
in
time
of
armed
strife
.
