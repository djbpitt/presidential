during
the
past
four
year
the
process
of
diffusion
,
a
applied
to
the
manufacture
of
sugar
from
sorghum
and
sugar
cane
,
ha
been
introduced
into
this
country
and
fully
perfected
by
the
experiment
carried
on
by
the
department
of
agriculture
.
this
process
is
now
universally
considered
to
be
the
most
economical
one
,
and
it
is
through
it
that
the
sorghum-sugar
industry
ha
been
established
upon
a
firm
basis
and
the
road
to
it
future
success
opened
.
the
adoption
of
this
diffusion
process
is
also
extending
in
louisiana
and
other
sugar-producing
part
of
the
country
,
and
will
doubtless
soon
be
the
only
method
employed
for
the
extraction
of
sugar
from
the
cane
.
