communism
is
a
hateful
thing
and
a
menace
to
peace
and
organized
government
;
but
the
communism
of
combined
wealth
and
capital
,
the
outgrowth
of
overweening
cupidity
and
selfishness
,
which
insidiously
undermines
the
justice
and
integrity
of
free
institution
,
is
not
le
dangerous
than
the
communism
of
oppressed
poverty
and
toil
,
which
,
exasperated
by
injustice
and
discontent
,
attack
with
wild
disorder
the
citadel
of
rule
.
