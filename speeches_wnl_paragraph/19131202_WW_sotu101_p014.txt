these
are
all
matter
of
vital
domestic
concern
,
and
besides
them
,
outside
the
charmed
circle
of
our
own
national
life
in
which
our
affection
command
u
,
a
well
a
our
conscience
,
there
stand
out
our
obligation
toward
our
territory
over
sea
.
here
we
are
trustee
.
porto
rico
,
hawaii
,
the
philippine
,
are
ours
,
indeed
,
but
not
ours
to
do
what
we
please
with
.
such
territory
,
once
regarded
a
mere
possession
,
are
no
longer
to
be
selfishly
exploited
;
they
are
part
of
the
domain
of
public
conscience
and
of
serviceable
and
enlightened
statesmanship
.
we
must
administer
them
for
the
people
who
live
in
them
and
with
the
same
sense
of
responsibility
to
them
a
toward
our
own
people
in
our
domestic
affair
.
no
doubt
we
shall
successfully
enough
bind
porto
rico
and
the
hawaiian
island
to
ourselves
by
tie
of
justice
and
interest
and
affection
,
but
the
performance
of
our
duty
toward
the
philippine
is
a
more
difficult
and
debatable
matter
.
we
can
satisfy
the
obligation
of
generous
justice
toward
the
people
of
porto
rico
by
giving
them
the
ample
and
familiar
right
and
privilege
accorded
our
own
citizen
in
our
own
territory
and
our
obligation
toward
the
people
of
hawaii
by
perfecting
the
provision
for
self-government
already
granted
them
,
but
in
the
philippine
we
must
go
further
.
we
must
hold
steadily
in
view
their
ultimate
independence
,
and
we
must
move
toward
the
time
of
that
independence
a
steadily
a
the
way
can
be
cleared
and
the
foundation
thoughtfully
and
permanently
laid
.
