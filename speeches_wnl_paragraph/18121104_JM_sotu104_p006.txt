a
distinguishing
feature
in
the
operation
which
preceded
and
followed
this
adverse
event
is
the
use
made
by
the
enemy
of
the
merciless
savage
under
their
influence
.
whilst
the
benevolent
policy
of
the
united
state
invariably
recommended
peace
and
promoted
civilization
among
that
wretched
portion
of
the
human
race
,
and
wa
making
exertion
to
dissuade
them
from
taking
either
side
in
the
war
,
the
enemy
ha
not
scrupled
to
call
to
his
aid
their
ruthless
ferocity
,
armed
with
the
horror
of
those
instrument
of
carnage
and
torture
which
are
known
to
spare
neither
age
nor
sex
.
in
this
outrage
against
the
law
of
honorable
war
and
against
the
feeling
sacred
to
humanity
the
british
commander
can
not
resort
to
a
plea
of
retaliation
,
for
it
is
committed
in
the
face
of
our
example
.
they
can
not
mitigate
it
by
calling
it
a
self-defense
against
men
in
arm
,
for
it
embrace
the
most
shocking
butchery
of
defenseless
family
.
nor
can
it
be
pretended
that
they
are
not
answerable
for
the
atrocity
perpetrated
,
since
the
savage
are
employed
with
a
knowledge
,
and
even
with
menace
,
that
their
fury
could
not
be
controlled
.
such
is
the
spectacle
which
the
deputed
authority
of
a
nation
boasting
it
religion
and
morality
have
not
been
restrained
from
presenting
to
an
enlightened
age
.
