i
do
not
believe
that
the
present
somber
prospect
in
turkey
will
be
long
permitted
to
offend
the
sight
of
christendom
.
it
so
mar
the
humane
and
enlightened
civilization
that
belongs
to
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
it
seems
hardly
possible
that
the
earnest
demand
of
good
people
throughout
the
christian
world
for
it
corrective
treatment
will
remain
unanswered
.
