now
,
even
a
health
care
reform
would
reduce
our
deficit
,
it
's
not
enough
to
dig
u
out
of
a
massive
fiscal
hole
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
it
's
a
challenge
that
make
all
others
that
much
harder
to
solve
and
one
that
's
been
subject
to
a
lot
of
political
posturing
.
so
let
me
start
the
discussion
of
government
spending
by
setting
the
record
straight
.
