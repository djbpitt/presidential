in
dealing
with
this
question
the
desire
manifested
by
the
indian
should
not
be
ignored
.
here
again
we
find
a
great
diversity
.
with
some
the
tribal
relation
is
cherished
with
the
utmost
tenacity
,
while
it
hold
upon
others
is
considerably
relaxed
;
the
love
of
home
is
strong
with
all
,
and
yet
there
are
those
whose
attachment
to
a
particular
locality
is
by
no
mean
unyielding
;
the
ownership
of
their
land
in
severalty
is
much
desired
by
some
,
while
by
others
,
and
sometimes
among
the
most
civilized
,
such
a
distribution
would
be
bitterly
opposed
.
