this
is
certainly
a
movement
in
the
right
direction
,
but
it
ought
to
be
at
once
supplemented
by
the
rebuilding
or
extensive
enlargement
of
this
improvised
prison
and
the
construction
of
at
least
one
more
,
to
be
located
in
the
southern
state
.
the
capacity
of
the
leavenworth
penitentiary
is
so
limited
that
the
expense
of
it
maintenance
,
calculated
at
a
per
caput
rate
upon
the
number
of
prisoner
it
can
accommodate
,
doe
not
make
a
economical
an
exhibit
a
it
would
if
it
were
larger
and
better
adapted
to
prison
purpose
;
but
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
economy
,
humanity
,
and
a
proper
sense
of
responsibility
and
duty
toward
those
whom
we
punish
for
violation
of
federal
law
dictate
that
the
federal
government
should
have
the
entire
control
and
management
of
the
penitentiary
where
convicted
violator
are
confined
.
