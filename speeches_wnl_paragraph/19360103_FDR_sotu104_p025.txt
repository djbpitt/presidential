in
these
latter
year
we
have
witnessed
the
domination
of
government
by
financial
and
industrial
group
,
numerically
small
but
politically
dominant
in
the
twelve
year
that
succeeded
the
world
war
.
the
present
group
of
which
i
speak
is
indeed
numerically
small
and
,
while
it
exercise
a
large
influence
and
ha
much
to
say
in
the
world
of
business
,
it
doe
not
,
i
am
confident
,
speak
the
true
sentiment
of
the
le
articulate
but
more
important
element
that
constitute
real
american
business
.
