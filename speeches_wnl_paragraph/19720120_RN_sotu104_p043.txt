we
have
fought
four
war
in
this
century
,
but
our
power
ha
never
been
used
to
break
the
peace
,
only
to
keep
it
;
never
been
used
to
destroy
freedom
,
only
to
defend
it
.
we
now
have
within
our
reach
the
goal
of
insuring
that
the
next
generation
can
be
the
first
generation
in
this
century
to
be
spared
the
scourge
of
war
.
