nor
can
such
arrangement
,
with
such
object
,
be
exposed
to
the
censure
or
jealousy
of
the
warmest
friend
of
republican
government
.
they
are
incapable
of
abuse
in
the
hand
of
the
militia
,
who
ought
to
posse
a
pride
in
being
the
depository
of
the
force
of
the
republic
,
and
may
be
trained
to
a
degree
of
energy
equal
to
every
military
exigency
of
the
united
state

but
it
is
an
inquiry
which
can
not
be
too
solemnly
pursued
,
whether
the
act
``
more
effectually
to
provide
for
the
national
defense
by
establishing
an
uniform
militia
throughout
the
united
state
''
ha
organized
them
so
a
to
produce
their
full
effect
;
whether
your
own
experience
in
the
several
state
ha
not
detected
some
imperfection
in
the
scheme
,
and
whether
a
material
feature
in
an
improvement
of
it
ought
not
to
be
to
afford
an
opportunity
for
the
study
of
those

the
military
art

can
scarcely

be
attained
by
practice
alone
