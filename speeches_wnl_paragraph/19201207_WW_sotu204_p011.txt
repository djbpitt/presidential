there
ha
also
been
a
marked
decrease
in
holding
of
government
war
security
by
the
banking
institution
of
the
country
,
a
well
a
in
the
amount
of
bill
held
by
the
federal
reserve
bank
secured
by
government
war
obligation
.
this
fortunate
result
ha
relieved
the
bank
and
left
them
freer
to
finance
the
need
of
agriculture
,
industry
,
and
commerce
.
it
ha
been
due
in
large
part
to
the
reduction
of
the
public
debt
,
especially
of
the
floating
debt
,
but
more
particularly
to
the
improved
distribution
of
government
security
among
permanent
investor
.
the
cessation
of
the
government's
borrowing
,
except
through
short-term
certificate
of
indebtedness
,
ha
been
a
matter
of
great
consequence
to
the
people
of
the
country
at
large
,
a
well
a
to
the
holder
of
liberty
bond
and
victory
note
,
and
ha
had
an
important
bearing
on
the
matter
of
effective
credit
control
.
