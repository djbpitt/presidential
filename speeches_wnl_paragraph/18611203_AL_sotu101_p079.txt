again
,
a
ha
already
been
said
,
there
is
not
of
necessity
any
such
thing
a
the
free
hired
laborer
being
fixed
to
that
condition
for
life
.
many
independent
men
everywhere
in
these
state
a
few
year
back
in
their
life
were
hired
laborer
.
the
prudent
,
penniless
beginner
in
the
world
labor
for
wage
awhile
,
save
a
surplus
with
which
to
buy
tool
or
land
for
himself
,
then
labor
on
his
own
account
another
while
,
and
at
length
hire
another
new
beginner
to
help
him
.
this
is
the
just
and
generous
and
prosperous
system
which
open
the
way
to
all
,
give
hope
to
all
,
and
consequent
energy
and
progress
and
improvement
of
condition
to
all
.
no
men
living
are
more
worthy
to
be
trusted
than
those
who
toil
up
from
poverty
;
none
le
inclined
to
take
or
touch
aught
which
they
have
not
honestly
earned
.
let
them
beware
of
surrendering
a
political
power
which
they
already
posse
,
and
which
if
surrendered
will
surely
be
used
to
close
the
door
of
advancement
against
such
a
they
and
to
fix
new
disability
and
burden
upon
them
till
all
of
liberty
shall
be
lost
.
