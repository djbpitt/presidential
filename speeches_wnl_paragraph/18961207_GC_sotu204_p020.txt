the
correctness
of
this
forecast
need
be
neither
affirmed

the
united
state
ha
,
nevertheless
,
a
character
to
maintain
a
a
nation
,
which
plainly
dictate
that
right
and
not

should
be
the
rule
of
it
conduct
.
further
,
though
the
united
state
is
not
a
nation
to
which
peace
is
a
necessity
,
it
is
in
truth
the
most
pacific
of
power

nothing

that
our
conduct
toward
spain
and
her
dominion
ha
constituted
no
exception
to
this
national
disposition
is
made
manifest
by
the
course
of
our
government
,
not
only
thus
far
during
the
present
insurrection
,

during
the
ten
year
that
followed

rising

no
other

power

it
may
safely
be
said
,
under
circumstance
of
similar
perplexity
,
would
have
manifested
the
same
restraint
and
the
same
patient
endurance
.
it
may
also
be
said
that
this
persistent
attitude
of
the
united
state
toward
spain
in
connection
with
cuba
unquestionably
evinces
no
slight
respect
and
regard
for
spain
on
the
part
of
the
american
people
.
they
in
truth
do
not
forget
her
connection
with
the
discovery
of
the
western
hemisphere
,
nor
do
they
underestimate
the
great
quality
of
the
spanish
people
nor
fail
to
fully
recognize
their
splendid
patriotism
and
their
chivalrous
devotion
to
the
national
honor
.
