with
rigid
economy
,
vigorous
salvage
operation
,
and
adequate
revenue
from
taxation
,
a
surplus
of
current
receipt
over
current
expenditure
can
be
realized
and
should
be
applied
to
the
floating
debt
.
all
branch
of
the
government
should
cooperate
to
see
that
this
program
is
realized
.
i
can
not
overemphasize
the
necessity
of
economy
in
government
appropriation
and
expenditure
and
the
avoidance
by
the
congress
of
practice
which
take
money
from
the
treasury
by
indefinite
or
revolving
fund
appropriation
.
the
estimate
for
the
present
year
show
that
over
a
billion
dollar
of
expenditure
were
authorized
by
the
last
congress
in
addition
to
the
amount
shown
in
the
usual
compiled
statement
of
appropriation
.
this
strikingly
illustrates
the
importance
of
making
direct
and
specific
appropriation
.
the
relation
between
the
current
receipt
and
current
expenditure
of
the
government
during
the
present
fiscal
year
,
a
well
a
during
the
last
half
of
the
last
fiscal
year
,
ha
been
disturbed
by
the
extraordinary
burden
thrown
upon
the
treasury
by
the
transportation
act
,
in
connection
with
the
return
of
the
railroad
to
private
control
.
over
$
600,000,000
ha
already
been
paid
to
the
railroad
under
this
act-
$
350,000,000
during
the
present
fiscal
year
;
and
it
is
estimated
that
further
payment
aggregating
possibly
$
650,000,000
must
still
be
made
to
the
railroad
during
the
current
year
.
it
is
obvious
that
these
large
payment
have
already
seriously
limited
the
government
's
progress
in
retiring
the
floating
debt
.
