but
the
fact
that
a
wrong
use
ha
been
made
of
a
just
idea
is
no
reason
why
a
right
use
should
not
be
made
of
it
.
it
ought
to
be
brought
under
the
patronage
of
it
real
friend
.
let
it
be
said
again
that
autocracy
must
first
be
shown
the
utter
futility
of
it
claim
to
power
or
leadership
in
the
modern
world
.
it
is
impossible
to
apply
any
standard
of
justice
so
long
a
such
force
are
unchecked
and
undefeated
a
the
present
master
of
germany
command
.
not
until
that
ha
been
done
can
right
be
set
up
a
arbiter
and
peace-maker
among
the
nation
.
but
when
that
ha
been
done
--
a
,
god
willing
,
it
assuredly
will
be
--
we
shall
at
last
be
free
to
do
an
unprecedented
thing
,
and
this
is
the
time
to
avow
our
purpose
to
do
it
.
we
shall
be
free
to
base
peace
on
generosity
and
justice
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
selfish
claim
to
advantage
even
on
the
part
of
the
victor
.
