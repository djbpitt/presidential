that
spirit—that
faith—speaks
to
u
in
our
daily
life
in
way
often
unnoticed
,
because
they
seem
so
obvious
.
it
speaks
to
u
here
in
the
capital
of
the
nation
.
it
speaks
to
u
through
the
process
of
governing
in
the
sovereignty
of
48
state
.
it
speaks
to
u
in
our
county
,
in
our
city
,
in
our
town
,
and
in
our
village
.
it
speaks
to
u
from
the
other
nation
of
the
hemisphere
,
and
from
those
across
the
seas—the
enslaved
,
a
well
a
the
free
.
sometimes
we
fail
to
hear
or
heed
these
voice
of
freedom
because
to
u
the
privilege
of
our
freedom
is
such
an
old
,
old
story
.
