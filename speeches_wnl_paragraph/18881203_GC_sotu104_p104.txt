i
repeat
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
by
me
that
the
appropriation
for
the
maintenance
of
our
diplomatic
and
consular
service
should
be
recast
;
that
the
so-called
notarial
or
unofficial
fee
,
which
our
representative
abroad
are
now
permitted
to
treat
a
personal
perquisite
,
should
be
forbidden
;
that
a
system
of
consular
inspection
should
be
instituted
,
and
that
a
limited
number
of
secretary
of
legation
at
large
should
be
authorized
.
