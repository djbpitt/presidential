to
hit
the
rest
of
our
deficit
reduction
target
,
we
should
do
what
leader
in
both
party
have
already
suggested
and
save
hundred
of
billion
of
dollar
by
getting
rid
of
tax
loophole
and
deduction
for
the
well-off
and
the
well-connected
.
after
all
,
why
would
we
choose
to
make
deeper
cut
to
education
and
medicare
just
to
protect
special
interest
tax
break
?
how
is
that
fair
?
why
is
it
that
deficit
reduction
is
a
big
emergency
justifying
making
cut
in
social
security
benefit
,
but
not
closing
some
loophole
?
how
doe
that
promote
growth
?
