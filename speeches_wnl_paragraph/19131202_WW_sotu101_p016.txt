a
duty
face
u
with
regard
to
alaska
which
seems
to
me
very
pressing
and
very
imperative
;
perhaps
i
should
say
a
double
duty
,
for
it
concern
both
the
political
and
the
material
development
of
the
territory
.
the
people
of
alaska
should
be
given
the
full
territorial
form
of
government
,
and
alaska
,
a
a
storehouse
,
should
be
unlocked
.
one
key
to
it
is
a
system
of
railway
.
these
the
government
should
itself
build
and
administer
,
and
the
port
and
terminal
it
should
itself
control
in
the
interest
of
all
who
wish
to
use
them
for
the
service
and
development
of
the
country
and
it
people
.
