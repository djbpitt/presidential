the
death
of
general
sheridan
in
august
last
wa
a
national
affliction
.
the
army
then
lost
the
grandest
of
it
chief
.
the
country
lost
a
brave
and
experienced
soldier
,
a
wise
and
discreet
counselor
,
and
a
modest
and
sensible
man
.
those
who
in
any
manner
came

the
range
of
his
personal
association
will
never
fail
to
pay
deserved
and
willing
homage
to
his
greatness
and
the
glory
of
his
career
,
but
they
will
cherish
with
more
tender
sensibility
the
loving
memory
of
his
simple
,
generous
,
and
considerate
nature
.
