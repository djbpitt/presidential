the
executive
branch
also
need
to
change
.
too
often
,
it
's
inefficient
,
outdated
,
and
remote
.
that
's
why
i
've
asked
this
congress
to
grant
me
the
authority
to
consolidate
the
federal
bureaucracy
so
that
our
government
is
leaner
,
quicker
,
and
more
responsive
to
the
need
of
the
american
people
.
