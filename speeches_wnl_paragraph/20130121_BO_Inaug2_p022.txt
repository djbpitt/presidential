we
,
the
people
,
declare
today
that
the
most
evident
of
truths—that
all
of
u
are
created
equal—is
the
star
that
guide
u
still
;
just
a
it
guided
our
forebear
through
seneca
fall
and
selma
and
stonewall
;
just
a
it
guided
all
those
men
and
woman
,
sung
and
unsung
,
who
left
footprint
along
this
great
mall
,
to
hear
a
preacher
say
that
we
can
not
walk
alone
;
to
hear
a
king
proclaim
that
our
individual
freedom
is
inextricably
bound
to
the
freedom
of
every
soul
on
earth
.
