know
,
one
of
my
proudest
possession
is
the
flag
that
the
seal
team
took
with
them
on
the
mission
to
get
bin
laden
.
on
it
are
each
of
their
name
.
some
may
be
democrat
,
some
may
be
republican
,
but
that
doe
n't
matter
.
just
like
it
did
n't
matter
that
day
in
the
situation
room
,
when
i
sat
next
to
bob
gate
,
a
man
who
wa
george
bush
's
defense
secretary
,
and
hillary
clinton
,
a
woman
who
