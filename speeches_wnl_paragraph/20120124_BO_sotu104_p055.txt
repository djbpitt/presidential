of
course
,
the
easiest
way
to
save
money
is
to
waste
le
energy
.
so
here
's
a
proposal
:
help
manufacturer
eliminate
energy
waste
in
their
factory
and
give
business
incentive
to
upgrade
their
building
.
their
energy
bill
will
be
a
hundred
billion
dollar
lower
over
the
next
decade
,
and
america
will
have
le
pollution
,
more
manufacturing
,
more
job
for
construction
worker
who
need
them
.
send
me
a
bill
that
creates
these
job
.
