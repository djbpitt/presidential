for
many
year
after
the
world
war
blind
economic
selfishness
in
most
country
,
including
our
own
,
resulted
in
a
destructive
mine-field
of
trade
restriction
which
blocked
the
channel
of
commerce
among
nation
.
indeed
,
this
policy
wa
one
of
the
contributing
cause
of
existing
war
.
it
dammed
up
vast
unsalable
surplus
,
helping
to
bring
about
unemployment
and
suffering
in
the
united
state
and
everywhere
else
.
