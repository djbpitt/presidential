in
looking
forward
to
the
future
expense
of
the
operation
which
may
be
found
inevitable
i
derive
consolation
from
the
information
i
receive
that
the
product
of
the
revenue
for
the
present
year
is
likely
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
additional
burthen
on
the
community
for
the
service
of
the
ensuing
year
.
this
,
however
,
will
be
better
ascertained
in
the
course
of
the
session
,
and
it
is
proper
to
add
that
the
information
alluded
to
proceeds
upon
the
supposition
of
no
material
extension
of
the
spirit
of
hostility
.
