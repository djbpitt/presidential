in
the
beginning
our
most
important
military
task
wa
to
prevent
our
enemies—the
strongest
and
most
violently
aggressive
power
that
ever
have
threatened
civilization—from
winning
decisive
victory
.
but
even
while
we
were
conducting
defensive
,
delaying
action
,
we
were
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
we
could
wrest
the
initiative
from
our
enemy
and
place
our
superior
resource
of
men
and
material
into
direct
competition
with
them
.
