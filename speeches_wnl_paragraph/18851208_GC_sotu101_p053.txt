the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
engagement
for
extradition
between
the
united
state
and
great
britain
ha
been
long
apparent
.
the
tenth
article
of
the
treaty
of
1842

one
of
the
earliest
compact
in
this
regard
entered
into
by
u
,
stipulated
for
surrender
in
respect
of
a
limited
number
of
offense
.
other
crime
no
le
inimical
to
the
social
welfare
should
be
embraced
and
the
procedure
of
extradition
brought
in
harmony
with
present
international
practice
.
negotiation
with
her

government
for
an
enlarged
treaty
of
extradition
have
been
pending
since
1870

that
a
satisfactory
result
may
be
soon
attained
