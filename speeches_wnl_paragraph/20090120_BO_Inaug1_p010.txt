the
greatness
of
our
nation
,
we
understand
that
greatness
is
never
a
given
.
it
must
be
earned
.
our
journey
ha
never
been

short-cuts
or
settling

it
ha
not
been
the
path
for
the
faint-hearted—for
those
who
prefer
leisure
over
work
,
or
seek
only
the
pleasure
of
rich
and
fame

rather
,
it
ha
been
the
risk-takers
,
the
doer
,
the
maker
of
things—some
celebrated
but
more
often
men
and
woman
obscure
in
their
labor

who

up
the
long

rugged
path
towards
prosperity
and
freedom
