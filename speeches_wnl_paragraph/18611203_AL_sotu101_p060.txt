to
carry
out
the
plan
of
colonization
may
involve
the
acquiring
of
territory
,
and
also
the
appropriation
of
money
beyond
that
to
be
expended
in
the
territorial
acquisition
.
having
practiced
the
acquisition
of
territory
for
nearly
sixty
year
,
the
question
of
constitutional
power
to
do
so
is
no
longer
an
open
one
with
u
.
the
power
wa
questioned
at
first
by
mr.
jefferson
,
who
,
however
,
in
the
purchase
of
louisiana
,
yielded
his
scruple
on
the
plea
of
great
expediency
.
if
it
be
said
that
the
only
legitimate
object
of
acquiring
territory
is
to
furnish
home
for
white
men
,
this
measure
effect
that
object
,
for
the
emigration
of
colored
men
leaf
additional
room
for
white
men
remaining
or
coming
here
.
mr.
jefferson
,
however
,
placed
the
importance
of
procuring
louisiana
more
on
political
and
commercial
ground
than
on
providing
room
for
population
.
