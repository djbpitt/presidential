it
is
true
that
prior
to
1914
the
united
state
often
had
been
disturbed
by
event
in
other
continent
.
we
had
even
engaged
in
two
war
with
european
nation
and
in
a
number
of
undeclared
war
in
the
west
indie
,
in
the
mediterranean
and
in
the
pacific
for
the
maintenance
of
american
right
and
for
the
principle
of
peaceful
commerce
.
but
in
no
case
had
a
serious
threat
been
raised
against
our
national
safety
or
our
continued
independence
.
