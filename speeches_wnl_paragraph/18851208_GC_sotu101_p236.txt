the
utah
commissioner
express
the
opinion
,
based
upon
such
information
a
they
are
able
to
obtain
,
that
but
few
polygamous
marriage
have
taken
place
in
the
territory
during
the
last
year
.
they
further
report
that
while
there
can
not
be
found
upon
the
registration
list
of
voter
the
name
of
a
man
actually
guilty
of
polygamy
,
and
while
none
of
that
class
are
holding
office
,
yet
at
the
last
election
in
the
territory
all
the
officer
elected
,
except
in
one
county
,
were
men
who
,
though
not
actually
living
in
the
practice
of
polygamy
,
subscribe
to
the
doctrine
of
polygamous
marriage
a
a
divine
revelation
and
a
law
unto
all
higher
and
more
binding
upon
the
conscience
than
any
human
law
,
local
or
national
.
thus
is
the
strange
spectacle
presented
of
a
community
protected
by
a
republican
form
of
government
,
to
which
they
owe
allegiance
,
sustaining
by
their
suffrage
a
principle
and
a
belief
which
set
at
naught
that
obligation
of
absolute
obedience
to
the
law
of
the
land
which
lie
at
the
foundation
of
republican
institution
.
