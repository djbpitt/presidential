the
law
embodying
this
reform
found
it
way
to
our
statute
book
more
from
fear
of
the
popular
sentiment
existing
in
it
favor
than
from
any
love
for
the
reform
itself
on
the
part
of
legislator
,
and
it
ha
lived
and
grown
and
flourished
in
spite
of
the
covert
a
well
a
open
hostility
of
spoilsmen
and
notwithstanding
the
querulous
impracticability
of
many
self-constituted
guardian
.
beneath
all
the
vagary
and
sublimated
theory
which
are
attracted
to
it
there
underlies
this
reform
a
sturdy
common-sense
principle
not
only
suited
to
this
mundane
sphere
,
but
whose
application
our
people
are
more
and
more
recognizing
to
be
absolutely
essential
to
the
most
successful
operation
of
their
government
,
if
not
to
it
perpetuity
.
