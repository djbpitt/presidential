we
do
n't
begrudge
financial
success
in
this
country
.
we
admire
it
.
when
american
talk
about
folk
like
me
paying
my
fair
share
of
tax
,
it
's
not
because
they
envy
the
rich
.
it
's
because
they
understand
that
when
i
get
a
tax
break
i
do
n't
need
and
the
country
ca
n't
afford
,
it
either
add
to
the
deficit
or
somebody
else
ha
to
make
up
the
difference
,
like
a
senior
on
a
fixed
income
or
a
student
trying
to
get
through
school
or
a
family
trying
to
make
end
meet
.
that
's
not
right
.
american
know
that
's
not
right
.
they
know
that
this
generation
's
success
is
only
possible
because
past
generation
felt
a
responsibility
to
each
other
and
to
the
future
of
their
country
,
and
they
know
our
way
of
life
will
only
endure
if
we
feel
that
same
sense
of
shared
responsibility
.
that
's
how
we
'll
reduce
our
deficit
.
that
's
an
america
built
to
last
.
