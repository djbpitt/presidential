the
recent
repeal
of
the
provision
of
law
requiring
the
purchase
of
silver
bullion
by
the
government
a
a
feature
of
our
monetary
scheme
ha
made
an
entire
change
in
the
complexion
of
our
currency
affair
.
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
ultimate
result
of
this
action
will
be
most
salutary
and
far-reaching
.
in
the
nature
of
thing
,
however
,
it
is
impossible
to
know
at
this
time
precisely
what
condition
will
be
brought
about
by
the
change
,
or
what
,
if
any
,
supplementary
legislation
may
in
the
light
of
such
condition
appear
to
be
essential
or
expedient
.
of
course
,
after
the
recent
financial
perturbation
,
time
is
necessary
for
the
reestablishment
of
business
confidence
.
when
,
however
,
through
this
restored
confidence
,
the
money
which
ha
been
frightened
into
hoarding
place
is
returned
to
trade
and
enterprise
,
a
survey
of
the
situation
will
probably
disclose
a
safe
path
leading
to
a
permanently
sound
currency
,
abundantly
sufficient
to
meet
every
requirement
of
our
increasing
population
and
business
.
