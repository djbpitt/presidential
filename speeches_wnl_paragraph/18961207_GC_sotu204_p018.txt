many
cuban
reside
in
this
country
,
and
indirectly
promote
the
insurrection
through
the
press
,
by
public
meeting
,
by
the
purchase
and
shipment
of
arm
,
by
the
raising
of
fund
,
and
by
other
mean
which
the
spirit
of
our
institution
and
the
tenor
of
our
law
do
not
permit
to
be
made
the
subject
of
criminal
prosecution
.
some
of
them
,
though
cuban
at
heart
and
in
all
their
feeling
and
interest
,
have
taken
out
paper
a
naturalized
citizen
of
the
united
state
--
a
proceeding
resorted
to
with
a
view
to
possible
protection
by
this
government
,
and
not
unnaturally
regarded
with
much
indignation
by
the
country
of
their
origin
.
the
insurgent
are
undoubtedly
encouraged
and
supported
by
the
widespread
sympathy
the
people
of
this
country
always
and
instinctively
feel
for
every
struggle
for
better
and
freer
government
,
and
which
,
in
the
case
of
the
more
adventurous
and
restless
element
of
our
population
,
lead
in
only
too
many
instance
to
active
and
personal
participation
in
the
contest
.
the
result
is
that
this
government
is
constantly
called
upon
to
protect
american
citizen
,
to
claim
damage
for
injury
to
person
and
property
,
now
estimated
at
many
million
of
dollar
,
and
to
ask
explanation
and
apology
for
the
act
of
spanish
official
whose
zeal
for
the
repression
of
rebellion
sometimes
blind
them
to
the
immunity
belonging
to
the
unoffending
citizen
of
a
friendly
power
.
it
follows
from
the
same
cause
that
the
united
state
is
compelled
to
actively
police
a
long
line
of
seacoast
against
unlawful
expedition
,
the
escape
of
which
the
utmost
vigilance
will
not
always
suffice
to
prevent
.
