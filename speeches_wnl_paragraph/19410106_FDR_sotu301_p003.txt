since
the
permanent
formation
of
our
government
under
the
constitution
,
in
1789
,
most
of
the
period
of
crisis
in
our
history
have
related
to
our
domestic
affair
.
fortunately
,
only
one
of
these—the
four-year
war
between
the
states—ever
threatened
our
national
unity
.
today
,
thank
god
,
one
hundred
and
thirty
million
american
,
in
forty-eight
state
,
have
forgotten
point
of
the
compass
in
our
national
unity
.
