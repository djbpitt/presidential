to
be
sure
,
in
so
doing
,
we
have
invited
battle
.
we
have
earned
the
hatred
of
entrenched
greed
.
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
that
we
faced
made
it
necessary
to
drive
some
people
from
power
and
strictly
to
regulate
others
.
i
made
that
plain
when
i
took
the
oath
of
office
in
march
,
1933
.
i
spoke
of
the
practice
of
the
unscrupulous
money-changers
who
stood
indicted
in
the
court
of
public
opinion
.
i
spoke
of
the
ruler
of
the
exchange
of
mankind
's
good
,
who
failed
through
their
own
stubbornness
and
their
own
incompetence
.
i
said
that
they
had
admitted
their
failure
and
had
abdicated
.
