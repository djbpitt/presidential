i
respectfully
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
present
condition
of
the
statute
law
,
with
the
hope
that
congress
will
be
able
to
find
an
easy
remedy
for
many
of
the
inconvenience
and
evil
which
constantly
embarrass
those
engaged
in
the
practical
administration
of
them
.
since
the
organization
of
the
government
congress
ha
enacted
some
5,000
act
and
joint
resolution
,
which
fill
more
than
6,000
closely
printed
page
and
are
scattered
through
many
volume
.
many
of
these
act
have
been
drawn
in
haste
and
without
sufficient
caution
,
so
that
their
provision
are
often
obscure
in
themselves
or
in
conflict
with
each
other
,
or
at
least
so
doubtful
a
to
render
it
very
difficult
for
even
the
best-informed
person
to
ascertain
precisely
what
the
statute
law
really
is
.
