a
considerable
number
of
american
vessel
which
were
in
england
when
the
revocation

order
in
council
took
place
were
laden
with
british
manufacture
under
an
erroneous
impression
that
the
non-importation
act
would
immediately
cease
to
operate
,
and
have
arrived
in
the

state
.
it
did
not
appear
proper
to
exercise
on
unforeseen
case
of
such
magnitude
the
power
vested
in
the
treasury
department
to
mitigate
forfeiture
without
previously
affording
to
congress
an
opportunity
of
making
on
the
subject
such
provision
a
they
may
think
proper
.
in
their
decision
they
will
doubtless
equally
consult
what
is
due
to
equitable
consideration
and
to
the
public
interest
