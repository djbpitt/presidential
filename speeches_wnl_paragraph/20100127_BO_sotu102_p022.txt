but
i
realize
that
for
every
success
story
,
there
are
other
story
,
of
men
and
woman
who
wake
up
with
the
anguish
of
not
knowing
where
their
next
paycheck
will
come
from
,
who
send
out
resume
week
after
week
and
hear
nothing
in
response
.
that
is
why
job
must
be
our
number-one
focus
in
2010
,
and
that
's
why
i
'm
calling
for
a
new
job
bill
tonight
.
