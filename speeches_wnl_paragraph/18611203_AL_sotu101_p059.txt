under
and
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
congress
entitled
``
an
act
to
confiscate
property
used
for
insurrectionary
purpose
,
''
approved
august
6
,
1861
,
the
legal
claim
of
certain
person
to
the
labor
and
service
of
certain
other
person
have
become
forfeited
,
and
number
of
the
latter
thus
liberated
are
already
dependent
on
the
united
state
and
must
be
provided
for
in
some
way
.
besides
this
,
it
is
not
impossible
that
some
of
the
state
will
pas
similar
enactment
for
their
own
benefit
respectively
,
and
by
operation
of
which
person
of
the
same
class
will
be
thrown
upon
them
for
disposal
.
in
such
case
i
recommend
that
congress
provide
for
accepting
such
person
from
such
state
,
according
to
some
mode
of
valuation
,
in
lieu
,
pro
tanto
,
of
direct
tax
,
or
upon
some
other
plan
to
be
agreed
on
with
such
state
respectively
;
that
such
person
,
on
such
acceptance
by
the
general
government
,
be
at
once
deemed
free
,
and
that
in
any
event
step
be
taken
for
colonizing
both
class
(
or
the
one
first
mentioned
if
the
other
shall
not
be
brought
into
existence
)
at
some
place
or
place
in
a
climate
congenial
to
them
.
it
might
be
well
to
consider
,
too
,
whether
the
free
colored
people
already
in
the
united
state
could
not
,
so
far
a
individual
may
desire
,
be
included
in
such
colonization
.
