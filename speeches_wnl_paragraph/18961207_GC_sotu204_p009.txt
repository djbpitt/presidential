we
have
made
claim
against
the
turkish
government
for
the
pillage
and
destruction
of
missionary
property
at
harpoot
and
marash
during
uprising
at
those
place
.
thus
far
the
validity
of
these
demand
ha
not
been
admitted
,
though
our
minister
,
prior
to
such
outrage
and
in
anticipation
of
danger
,
demanded
protection
for
the
person
and
property
of
our
missionary
citizen
in
the
locality
mentioned
and
notwithstanding
that
strong
evidence
exists
of
actual
complicity
of
turkish
soldier
in
the
work
of
destruction
and
robbery
.
