one
of
the
great
american
industrialist
of
our
day—a
man
who
ha
rendered
yeoman
service
to
his
country
in
this
crisis-recently
emphasized
the
grave
danger
of
``
rightist
reaction
''
in
this
nation
.
all
clear-thinking
businessmen
share
his
concern
.
indeed
,
if
such
reaction
should
develop—if
history
were
to
repeat
itself
and
we
were
to
return
to
the
so-called
``
normalcy
''
of
the
1920's—then
it
is
certain
that
even
though
we
shall
have
conquered
our
enemy
on
the
battlefield
abroad
,
we
shall
have
yielded
to
the
spirit
of
fascism
here
at
home
.
