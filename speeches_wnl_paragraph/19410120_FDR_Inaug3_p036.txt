the
destiny
of
america
wa
proclaimed
in
word
of
prophecy
spoken
by
our
first
president
in
his
first
inaugural
in
1789â€”words
almost
directed
,
it
would
seem
,
to
this
year
of
1941
:
``
the
preservation
of
the
sacred
fire
of
liberty
and
the
destiny
of
the
republican
model
of
government
are
justly
considered
.
.
.
deeply
,
.
.
.
finally
,
staked
on
the
experiment
intrusted
to
the
hand
of
the
american
people
.
