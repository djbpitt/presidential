through
it
all
,
we
have
never
relinquished
our
skepticism
of
central
authority
nor
have
we
succumbed
to
the
fiction
that
all
society
's
ill
can
be
cured
through
government
alone
.
our
celebration
of
initiative
and
enterprise
,
our
insistence
on
hard
work
and
personal
responsibility
,
these
are
constant
in
our
character
.
