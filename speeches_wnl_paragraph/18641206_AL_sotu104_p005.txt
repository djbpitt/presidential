at
the
request
of
the
state
of
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
,
a
competent
engineer
ha
been
authorized
to
make
a
survey
of
the
river
san
juan
and
the
port
of
san
juan
.
it
is
a
source
of
much
satisfaction
that
the
difficulty
which
for
a
moment
excited
some
political
apprehension
and
caused
a
closing
of
the
interoceanic
transit
route
have
been
amicably
adjusted
,
and
that
there
is
a
good
prospect
that
the
route
will
soon
be
reopened
with
an
increase
of
capacity
and
adaptation
.
we
could
not
exaggerate
either
the
commercial
or
the
political
importance
of
that
great
improvement
.
