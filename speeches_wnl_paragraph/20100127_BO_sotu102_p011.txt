it
's
because
of
this
spirit
,
this
great
decency
and
great
strength
,
that
i
have
never
been
more
hopeful
about
america
's
future
than
i
am
tonight
.
despite
our
hardship
,
our
union
is
strong
.
we
do
not
give
up
.
we
do
not
quit
.
we
do
not
allow
fear
or
division
to
break
our
spirit
.
in
this
new
decade
,
it
's
time
the
american
people
get
a
government
that
match
their
decency
,
that
embodies
their
strength
.
and
tonight
i
'd
like
to
talk
about
how
together
we
can
deliver
on
that
promise
.
