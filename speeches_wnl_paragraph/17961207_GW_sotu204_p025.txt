the
compensation
to
the
officer
of
the
united
state
in
various
instance
,
and
in
none
more
than
in
respect
to
the
most
important
station
,
appear
to
call
for
legislative
revision
.
the
consequence
of
a
defective
provision
are
of
serious
import
to
the
government
.
if
private
wealth
is
to
supply
the
defect
of
public
retribution
,
it
will
greatly
contract
the
sphere
within
which
the
selection
of
character
for
office
is
to
be
made
,
and
will
proportionally
diminish
the
probability
of
a
choice
of
men
able
a
well
a
upright
.
besides
that
,
it
should
be
repugnant
to
the
vital
principle
of
our
government
virtually
to
exclude
from
public
trust
talent
and
virtue
unless
accompanied
by
wealth
.
