no
opportunity
ha
been
omitted
to
testify
the
friendliness
of
this
government
toward
korea
,
whose
entrance
into
the
family
of
treaty
power
the
united
state
were
the
first
to
recognize
.
i
regard
with
favor
the
application
made
by
the
korean
government
to
be
allowed
to
employ
american
officer
a
military
instructor
,
to
which
the
assent
of
congress
becomes
necessary
,
and
i
am
happy
to
say
this
request
ha
the
concurrent
sanction
of
china
and
japan
.
