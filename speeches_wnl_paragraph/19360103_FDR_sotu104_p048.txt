i
am
confident
that
the
congress
of
the
united
state
well
understands
the
fact
and
is
ready
to
wage
unceasing
warfare
against
those
who
seek
a
continuation
of
that
spirit
of
fear
.
the
carrying
out
of
the
law
of
the
land
a
enacted
by
the
congress
requires
protection
until
final
adjudication
by
the
highest
tribunal
of
the
land
.
the
congress
ha
the
right
and
can
find
the
mean
to
protect
it
own
prerogative
.
