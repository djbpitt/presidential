our
action
will
not
prevent
every
senseless
act
of
violence
in
this
country
.
in
fact
,
no
law
,
no
initiative
,
no
administrative
act
will
perfectly
solve
all
the
challenge
i
've
outlined
tonight
.
but
we
were
never
sent
here
to
be
perfect
.
we
were
sent
here
to
make
what
difference
we
can
,
to
secure
this
nation
,
expand
opportunity
,
uphold
our
ideal
through
the
hard
,
often
frustrating
,
but
absolutely
necessary
work
of
self-government
.
