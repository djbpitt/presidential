were
the
spanish
army
able
to
meet
their
antagonist
in
the
open
or
in
pitched
battle
,
prompt
and
decisive
result
might
be
looked
for
,
and
the
immense
superiority
of
the
spanish
force
in
number
,
discipline
,
and
equipment
could
hardly
fail
to
tell
greatly
to
their
advantage
.
but
they
are
called
upon
to
face
a
foe
that
shuns
general
engagement
,
that
can
choose
and
doe
choose
it
own
ground
,
that
from
the
nature
of
the
country
is
visible
or
invisible
at
pleasure
,
and
that
fight
only
from
ambuscade
and
when
all
the
advantage
of
position
and
number
are
on
it
side
.
in
a
country
where
all
that
is
indispensable
to
life
in
the
way
of
food
,
clothing
,
and
shelter
is
so
easily
obtainable
,
especially
by
those
born
and
bred
on
the
soil
,
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
hardly
a
limit
to
the
time
during
which
hostility
of
this
sort
may
be
prolonged
.
meanwhile
,
a
in
all
case
of
protracted
civil
strife
,
the
passion
of
the
combatant
grow
more
and
more
inflamed
and
excess
on
both
side
become
more
frequent
and
more
deplorable
.
they
are
also
participated
in
by
band
of
marauder
,
who
,
now
in
the
name
of
one
party
and
now
in
the
name
of
the
other
,
a
may
best
suit
the
occasion
,
harry
the
country
at
will
and
plunder
it
wretched
inhabitant
for
their
own
advantage
.
such
a
condition
of
thing
would
inevitably
entail
immense
destruction
of
property
,
even
if
it
were
the
policy
of
both
party
to
prevent
it
a
far
a
practicable
;
but
while
such
seemed
to
be
the
original
policy
of
the
spanish
government
,
it
ha
now
apparently
abandoned
it
and
is
acting
upon
the
same
theory
a
the
insurgent
,
namely
,
that
the
exigency
of
the
contest
require
the
wholesale
annihilation
of
property
that
it
may
not
prove
of
use
and
advantage
to
the
enemy
.
