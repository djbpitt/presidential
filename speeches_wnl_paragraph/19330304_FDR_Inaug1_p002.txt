this
is
a
day
of
national
consecration
.
and
i
am
certain
that
on
this
day
my
fellow
american
expect
that
on
my
induction
into
the
presidency
i
will
address
them
with
a
candor
and
a
decision
which
the
present
situation
of
our
people
impels
.
this
is
preeminently
the
time
to
speak
the
truth
,
the
whole
truth
,
frankly
and
boldly
.
nor
need
we
shrink
from
honestly
facing
condition
in
our
country
today
.
this
great
nation
will
endure
a
it
ha
endured
,
will
revive
and
will
prosper
.
so
,
first
of
all
,
let
me
assert
my
firm
belief
that
the
only
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
itselfâ€”nameless
,
unreasoning
,
unjustified
terror
which
paralyzes
needed
effort
to
convert
retreat
into
advance
.
in
every
dark
hour
of
our
national
life
a
leadership
of
frankness
and
vigor
ha
met
with
that
understanding
and
support
of
the
people
themselves
which
is
essential
to
victory
.
i
am
convinced
that
you
will
again
give
that
support
to
leadership
in
these
critical
day
.
