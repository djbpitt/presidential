this
unexceptionable
course
could
not
avail
against
the
injustice
and
violence
of
the
belligerent
power
.
in
their
rage
against
each
other
,
or
impelled
by
more
direct
motif
,
principle
of
retaliation
have
been
introduced
equally
contrary
to
universal
reason
and
acknowledged
law
.
how
long
their
arbitrary
edict
will
be
continued
in
spite
of
the
demonstration
that
not
even
a
pretext
for
them
ha
been
given
by
the
united
state
,
and
of
the
fair
and
liberal
attempt
to
induce
a
revocation
of
them
,
can
not
be
anticipated
.
assuring
myself
that
under
every
vicissitude
the
determined
spirit
and
united
council
of
the
nation
will
be
safeguard
to
it
honor
and
it
essential
interest
,
i
repair
to
the
post
assigned
me
with
no
other
discouragement
than
what
spring
from
my
own
inadequacy
to
it
high
duty
.
if
i
do
not
sink
under
the
weight
of
this
deep
conviction
it
is
because
i
find
some
support
in
a
consciousness
of
the
purpose
and
a
confidence
in
the
principle
which
i
bring
with
me
into
this
arduous
service
.
