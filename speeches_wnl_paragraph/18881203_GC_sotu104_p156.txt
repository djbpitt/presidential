it
is
gratifying
to
note
from
the
carefully
prepared
statistic
accompanying
the
postmaster-general
's
report
that
notwithstanding
the
great
expansion
of
the
service
the
rate
of
expenditure
ha
been
lessened
and
efficiency
ha
been
improved
in
every
branch
;
that
fraud
and
crime
have
decreased
;
that
loss
from
the
mail
have
been
reduced
,
and
that
the
number
of
complaint
of
the
service
made
to
postmaster
and
to
the
department
are
far
le
than
ever
before
.
