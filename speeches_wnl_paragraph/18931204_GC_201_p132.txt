the
vast
area
of
land
which
but
a
short
time
ago
constituted
the
public
domain
is
rapidly
falling
into
private
hand
.
it
is
certain
that
in
the
transfer
the
beneficent
intention
of
the
government
to
supply
from
it
domain
home
to
the
industrious
and
worthy
home
seeker
is
often
frustrated
.
though
the
speculator
,
who
stand
with
extortionate
purpose
between
the
land
office
and
those
who
,
with
their
family
,
are
invited
by
the
government
to
settle
on
the
public
land
,
is
a
despicable
character
who
ought
not
to
be
tolerated
,
yet
it
is
difficult
to
thwart
his
scheme
.
the
recent
opening
to
settlement
of
the
land
in
the
cherokee
outlet
,
embracing
an
area
of
6,500,000
acre
,
notwithstanding
the
utmost
care
in
framing
the
regulation
governing
the
selection
of
location
and
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
united
state
troop
,
furnished
an
exhibition
,
though
perhaps
in
a
modified
degree
,
of
the
mad
scramble
,
the
violence
,
and
the
fraudulent
occupation
which
have
accompanied
previous
opening
of
public
land
.
