estimate
for
the
remaining
three
quarter
of
the
year

for
the
financial
year
1863
,
together
with
his

for
meeting
the
demand
contemplated
by

,
will
be
submitted
to
congress
by
the
secretary
of
the

.
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
the
expenditure
made
necessary
by
the
rebellion
are
not
beyond
the
resource
of
the
loyal
people
,
and
to
believe
that
the
same
patriotism
which
ha
thus
far
sustained
the
government
will
continue
to
sustain
it
till
peace
and
union
shall
again
bless
the
land
