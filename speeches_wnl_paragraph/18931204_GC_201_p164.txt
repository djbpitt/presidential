i
earnestly
urge
that
the
clerk
necessary
to
carry
on
the
work
of
the
commission
be
regularly
put
upon
it
roster
and
that
the
system
of
obliging
the
commissioner
to
rely
upon
the
service
of
clerk
belonging
to
other
department
be
discontinued
.
this
ought
not
to
increase
the
expense
to
the
government
,
while
it
would
certainly
be
more
consistent
and
add
greatly
to
the
efficiency
of
the
commission
.
