i
have
presented
to
the
leader
of
the
congress
today
a
message
of
15,000
word
discussing
in
some
detail
where
the
nation
stand
and
setting
forth
specific
legislative
item
on
which
i
have
asked
the
congress
to
act
.
much
of
this
is
legislation
which
i
proposed
in
1969
,
in
1970
,
and
also
in
the
first
session
of
this
92d
congress
and
on
which
i
feel
it
is
essential
that
action
be
completed
this
year
.
