i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
is
no
sentiment
more
general
in
the
mind
of
the
people
of
our
country
than
a
conviction
of
the
correctness
of
the
principle
upon
which
the
law
enforcing
civil-service
reform
is
based
.
in
it
present
condition
the
law
regulates
only
a
part
of
the
subordinate
public
position
throughout
the
country
.
it
applies
the
test
of
fitness
to
applicant
for
these
place
by
mean
of
a
competitive
examination
,
and
give
large
discretion
to
the
commissioner
a
to
the
character
of
the
examination
and
many
other
matter
connected
with
it
execution
.
thus
the
rule
and
regulation
adopted
by
the
commission
have
much
to
do
with
the
practical
usefulness
of
the
statute
and
with
the
result
of
it
application
.
