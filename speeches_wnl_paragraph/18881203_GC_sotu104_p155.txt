the
legislation
affecting
the
relation
of
the
government
with
railroad
is
in
need
of
revision
.
while
for
the
most
part
the
railroad
company
throughout
the
country
have
cordially
cooperated
with
the
post-office
department
in
rendering
excellent
service
,
yet
under
the
law
a
it
stand
,
while
the
compensation
to
them
for
carrying
the
mail
is
limited
and
regulated
,
and
although
railroad
are
made
post-roads
by
law
,
there
is
no
authority
reposed
anywhere
to
compel
the
owner
of
a
railroad
to
take
and
carry
the
united
state
mail
.
the
only
alternative
provided
by
act
of
congress
in
case
of
refusal
is
for
the
postmaster-general
to
send
mail
forward
by
pony
express
.
this
is
but
an
illustration
of
ill-fitting
legislation
,
reasonable
and
proper
at
the
time
of
it
enactment
,
but
long
since
outgrown
and
requiring
readjustment
.
