america
must
also
face
the
rapidly
growing
threat
from
cyber
attack
.
now
,
we
know
hacker
steal
people
's
identity
and
infiltrate
private
e-mail
.
we
know
foreign
country
and
company
swipe
our
corporate
secret
.
now
our
enemy
are
also
seeking
the
ability
to
sabotage
our
power
grid
,
our
financial
institution
,
our
air
traffic
control
system
.
we
can
not
look
back
year
from
now
and
wonder
why
we
did
nothing
in
the
face
of
real
threat
to
our
security
and
our
economy
.
