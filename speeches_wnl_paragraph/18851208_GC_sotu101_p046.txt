i
regret
to
say
that
the
restriction
upon
the
importation
of
our
pork
into
france
continue
,
notwithstanding
the
abundant
demonstration
of
the
absence
of
sanitary
danger
in
it
use
;
but
i
entertain
strong
hope
that
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
matter
this
vexatious
prohibition
will
be
removed
.
it
would
be
pleasing
to
be
able
to
say
a
much
with
respect
to
germany
,
austria
,
and
other
country
,
where
such
food
product
are
absolutely
excluded
,
without
present
prospect
of
reasonable
change
.
