agriculture
,
confessedly
the
largest
interest
of
the
nation
,
ha
not
a
department
nor
a
bureau
,
but
a
clerkship
only
,
assigned
to
it
in
the
government
.
while
it
is
fortunate
that
this
great
interest
is
so
independent
in
it
nature
a
to
not
have
demanded
and
extorted
more
from
the
government
,
i
respectfully
ask
congress
to
consider
whether
something
more
can
not
be
given
voluntarily
with
general
advantage
.
