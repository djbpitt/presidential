at
the
period
of
our
last
meeting
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
communicating
an
adjustment
with
one
of
the
principal
belligerent
nation
,
highly
important
in
itself
,
and
still
more
so
a
presaging
a
more
extended
accommodation
.
it
is
with
deep
concern
i
am
now
to
inform
you
that
the
favorable
prospect
ha
been
over-clouded
by
a
refusal
of
the
british
government
to
abide
by
the
act
of
it
minister
plenipotentiary
,
and
by
it
ensuing
policy
toward
the
united
state
a
seen
through
the
communication
of
the
minister
sent
to
replace
him
.
