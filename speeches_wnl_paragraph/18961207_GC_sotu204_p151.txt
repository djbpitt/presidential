it
is
not
one
of
the
function
of
our
government
to
accumulate
and
make
addition
to
a
fund
not
needed
for
immediate
expenditure
.
with
individual
it
is
the
chief
object
of
struggle
and
effort
.
the
application
of
an
accumulated
fund
by
the
government
to
the
payment
of
it
running
expense
is
a
duty
.
an
individual
living
beyond
his
income
and
embarrassing
himself
with
debt
or
drawing
upon
his
accumulated
fund
of
principal
is
either
unfortunate
or
improvident
.
the
distinction
is
between
a
government
charged
with
the
duty
of
expending
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
and
for
proper
purpose
all
the
money
it
receives
from
any
source
,
and
the
individual
,
who
is
expected
to
manifest
a
natural
desire
to
avoid
debt
or
to
accumulate
a
much
a
possible
and
to
live
within
the
income
derived
from
such
accumulation
,
to
the
end
that
they
may
be
increased
or
at
least
remain
unimpaired
for
the
future
use
and
enjoyment
of
himself
or
the
object
of
his
love
and
affection
who
may
survive
him
.
