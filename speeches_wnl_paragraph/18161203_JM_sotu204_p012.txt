i
am
happy
to
ad
that
the
tranquillity
which
ha
been
restored
among
the
tribe
themselves
,
a
well
a
between
them
and
our
own
population
,
will
favor
the
resumption
of
the
work
of
civilization
which
had
made
an
encouraging
progress
among
some
tribe
,
and
that
the
facility
is
increasing
for
extending
that
divided
and
individual
ownership
,
which
exists
now
in
movable
property
only
,
to
the
soil
itself
,
and
of
thus
establishing
in
the
culture
and
improvement
of
it
the
true
foundation
for
a
transit
from
the
habit
of
the
savage
to
the
art
and
comfort
of
social
life
.
