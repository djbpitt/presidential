finally
,
none
of
this
can
happen
unless
we
also
lower
the
temperature
in
this
town
.
we
need
to
end
the
notion
that
the
two
party
must
be
locked
in
a
perpetual
campaign
of
mutual
destruction
,
that
politics
is
about
clinging
to
rigid
ideology
instead
of
building
consensus
around
commonsense
idea
.
