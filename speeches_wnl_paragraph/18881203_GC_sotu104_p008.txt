we
view
with
pride
and
satisfaction
this
bright
picture
of
our
country
's
growth
and
prosperity
,
while
only
a
closer
scrutiny
develops
a
somber
shading
.
upon
more
careful
inspection
we
find
the
wealth
and
luxury
of
our
city
mingled
with
poverty
and
wretchedness
and
unremunerative
toil
.
a
crowded
and
constantly
increasing
urban
population
suggests
the
impoverishment
of
rural
section
and
discontent
with
agricultural
pursuit
.
the
farmer
's
son
,
not
satisfied
with
his
father
's
simple
and
laborious
life
,
join
the
eager
chase
for
easily
acquired
wealth
.
