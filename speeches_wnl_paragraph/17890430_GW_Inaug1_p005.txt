i
dwell
on
this
prospect
with
every
satisfaction
which
an
ardent
love
for
my
country
can
inspire
:
since
there
is
no
truth
more
thoroughly
established
,
than
that
there
exists
in
the
oeconomy
and
course
of
nature
,
an
indissoluble
union
between
virtue
and
happiness
,
between
duty
and
advantage
,
between
the
genuine
maxim
of
an
honest
and
magnanimous
policy
,
and
the
solid
reward
of
public
prosperity
and
felicity
:
since
we
ought
to
be
no
le
persuaded
that
the
propitious
smile
of
heaven
,
can
never
be
expected
on
a
nation
that
disregard
the
eternal
rule
of
order
and
right
,
which
heaven
itself
ha
ordained
:
and
since
the
preservation
of
the
sacred
fire
of
liberty
,
and
the
destiny
of
the
republican
model
of
government
,
are
justly
considered
a
deeply
,
perhaps
a
finally
staked
,
on
the
experiment
entrusted
to
the
hand
of
the
american
people
.
