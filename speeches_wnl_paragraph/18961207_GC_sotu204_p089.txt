there
should
be
a
small
addition
to
the
existing
inspector
service
,
to
be
employed
in
the
supervision
of
the
carrier
force
,
which
now
number
13,000
men
and
performs
it
service
practically
without
the
surveillance
exercised
over
all
other
branch
of
the
postal
or
public
service
.
of
course
such
a
lack
of
supervision
and
freedom
from
wholesome
disciplinary
restraint
must
inevitably
lead
to
imperfect
service
.
there
should
also
be
appointed
a
few
inspector
who
could
assist
the
central
office
in
necessary
investigation
concerning
matter
of
post-office
lease
,
post-office
site
,
allowance
for
rent
,
fuel
,
and
light
,
and
in
organizing
and
securing
the
best
result
from
the
work
of
the
14,000
clerk
now
employed
in
first
and
second
class
office
.
