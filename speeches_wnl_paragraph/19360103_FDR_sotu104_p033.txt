the
principle
that
they
would
instill
into
government
if
they
succeed
in
seizing
power
is
well
shown
by
the
principle
which
many
of
them
have
instilled
into
their
own
affair
:
autocracy
toward
labor
,
toward
stockholder
,
toward
consumer
,
toward
public
sentiment
.
autocrat
in
smaller
thing
,
they
seek
autocracy
in
bigger
thing
.
``
by
their
fruit
ye
shall
know
them
