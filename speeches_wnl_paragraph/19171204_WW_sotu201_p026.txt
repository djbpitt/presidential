and
i
beg
that
the
member
of
the
house
of
representative
will
permit
me
to
express
the
opinion
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
deal
in
any
but
a
very
wasteful
and
extravagant
fashion
with
the
enormous
appropriation
of
the
public
money
which
must
continue
to
be
made
,
if
the
war
is
to
be
properly
sustained
,
unless
the
house
will
consent
to
return
to
it
former
practice
of
initiating
and
preparing
all
appropriation
bill
through
a
single
committee
,
in
order
that
responsibility
may
be
centered
,
expenditure
standardized
and
made
uniform
,
and
waste
and
duplication
a
much
a
possible
avoided
.
