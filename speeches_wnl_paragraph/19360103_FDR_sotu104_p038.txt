shall
we
say
to
the
several
million
of
unemployed
citizen
who
face
the
very
problem
of
existence
,
of
getting
enough
to
eat
,
``
we
will
withdraw
from
giving
you
work
.
we
will
turn
you
back
to
the
charity
of
your
community
and
those
men
of
selfish
power
who
tell
you
that
perhaps
they
will
employ
you
if
the
government
leaf
them
strictly
alone
?
