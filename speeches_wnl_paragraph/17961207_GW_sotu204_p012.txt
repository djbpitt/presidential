to
an
active
external
commerce
the
protection
of
a
naval
force
is
indispensable
.
this
is
manifest
with
regard
to
war
in
which
a
state
is
itself
a
party
.
but
besides
this
,
it
is
in
our
own
experience
that
the
most
sincere
neutrality
is
not
a
sufficient
guard
against
the
depredation
of
nation
at
war
.
to
secure
respect
to
a
neutral
flag
requires
a
naval
force
organized
and
ready
to
vindicate
it
from
insult
or
aggression
.
this
may
even
prevent
the
necessity
of
going
to
war
by
discouraging
belligerent
power
from
committing
such
violation
of
the
right
of
the
neutral
party
a
may
,
first
or
last
,
leave
no
other
option
.
from
the
best
information
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
it
would
seem
a
if
our
trade
to
the
mediterranean
without
a
protecting
force
will
always
be
insecure
and
our
citizen
exposed
to
the
calamity
from
which
number
of
them
have
but
just
been
relieved
.
