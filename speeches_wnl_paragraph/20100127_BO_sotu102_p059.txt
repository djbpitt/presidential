now
,
even
after
paying
for
what
we
spent
on
my
watch
,
we
'll
still
face
the
massive
deficit
we
had
when
i
took
office
.
more
importantly
,
the
cost
of
medicare
,
medicaid
,
and
social
security
will
continue
to
skyrocket
.
that
's
why
i
've
called
for
a
bipartisan
fiscal
commission
,
modeled
on
a
proposal
by
republican
judd
gregg
and
democrat
kent
conrad
.
this
ca
n't
be
one
of
those
washington
gimmick
that
let
u
pretend
we
solve
a
problem
.
the
commission
will
have
to
provide
a
specific
set
of
solution
by
a
certain
deadline
.
