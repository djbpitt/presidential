let
's
remember
how
we
got
here
.
long
before
the
recession
,
job
and
manufacturing
began
leaving
our
shore
.
technology
made
business
more
efficient
,
but
also
made
some
job
obsolete
.
folk
at
the
top
saw
their
income
rise
like
never
before
,
but
most
hard-working
american
struggled
with
cost
that
were
growing
,
paycheck
that
were
n't
,
and
personal
debt
that
kept
piling
up
.
