i
am
not
at
all
in
sympathy
with
those
benevolent
but
injudicious
people
who
are
constantly
insisting
that
these
indian
should
be
returned
to
their
reservation
.
their
removal
wa
an
absolute
necessity
if
the
life
and
property
of
citizen
upon
the
frontier
are
to
be
at
all
regarded
by
the
government
.
their
continued
restraint
at
a
distance
from
the
scene
of
their
repeated
and
cruel
murder
and
outrage
is
still
necessary
.
it
is
a
mistaken
philanthropy
,
every
way
injurious
,
which
prompt
the
desire
to
see
these
savage
returned
to
their
old
haunt
.
they
are
in
their
present
location
a
the
result
of
the
best
judgment
of
those
having
official
responsibility
in
the
matter
,
and
who
are
by
no
mean
lacking
in
kind
consideration
for
the
indian
.
a
number
of
these
prisoner
have
forfeited
their
life
to
outraged
law
and
humanity
.
experience
ha
proved
that
they
are
dangerous
and
can
not
be
trusted
.
this
is
true
not
only
of
those
who
on
the
warpath
have
heretofore
actually
been
guilty
of
atrocious
murder
,
but
of
their
kindred
and
friend
,
who
,
while
they
remained
upon
their
reservation
,
furnished
aid
and
comfort
to
those
absent
with
bloody
intent
.
