i
know
there
have
been
question
about
whether
we
can
afford
such
change
in
a
tough
economy
.
i
know
that
there
are
those
who
disagree
with
the
overwhelming
scientific
evidence
on
climate
change
.
but
here
's
the
thing
:
even
if
you
doubt
the
evidence
,
providing
incentive
for
energy
efficiency
and
clean
energy
are
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
future
,
because
the
nation
that
lead
the
clean
energy
economy
will
be
the
nation
that
lead
the
global
economy
.
and
america
must
be
that
nation
.
