it
will
merit
consideration
also
whether
a
auxiliary
to
the
security
of
our
frontier
corp
may
not
be
advantageously
organized
with
a
restriction
of
their
service
to
particular
district
convenient
to
them
,
and
whether
the
local
and
occasional
service
of
mariner
and
others
in
the
sea
port
town
under
a
similar
organization
would
not
be
a
provident
addition
to
the
mean
of
their
defense
.
