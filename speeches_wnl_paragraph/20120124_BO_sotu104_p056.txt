building
this
new
energy
future
should
be
just
one
part
of
a
broader
agenda
to
repair
america
's
infrastructure
.
so
much
of
america
need
to
be
rebuilt
.
we
've
got
crumbling
road
and
bridge
,
a
power
grid
that
waste
too
much
energy
,
an
incomplete
high-speed
broadband
network
that
prevents
a
small-business
owner
in
rural
america
from
selling
her
product
all
over
the
world
.
