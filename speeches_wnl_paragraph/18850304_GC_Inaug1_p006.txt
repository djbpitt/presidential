to-day
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
is
transferred
to
newkeeping
.
but
this
is
still
the
government
of
all
the
people
,
and
it
shouldbe
none
the
le
an
object
of
their
affectionate
solicitude
.
at
this
hourthe
animosity
of
political
strife
,
the
bitterness
of
partisan
defeat
,
and
the
exultation
of
partisan
triumph
should
be
supplanted
by
an
ungrudgingacquiescence
in
the
popular
will
and
a
sober
,
conscientious
concern
forthe
general
weal
.
moreover
,
if
from
this
hour
we
cheerfully
and
honestlyabandon
all
sectional
prejudice
and
distrust
,
and
determine
,
with
manlyconfidence
in
one
another
,
to
work
out
harmoniously
the
achievement
ofour
national
destiny
,
we
shall
deserve
to
realize
all
the
benefit
whichour
happy
form
of
government
can
bestow
.
