the
law
of
progress
are
vital
and
organic
,
and
we
must
be
conscious
of
that
irresistible
tide
of
commercial
expansion
which
,
a
the
concomitant
of
our
active
civilization
,
day
by
day
is
being
urged
onward
by
those
increasing
facility
of
production
,
transportation
,
and
communication
to
which
steam
and
electricity
have
given
birth
;
but
our
duty
in
the
present
instructs
u
to
address
ourselves
mainly
to
the
development
of
the
vast
resource
of
the
great
area
committed
to
our
charge
and
to
the
cultivation
of
the
art
of
peace
within
our
own
border
,
though
jealously
alert
in
preventing
the
american
hemisphere
from
being
involved
in
the
political
problem
and
complication
of
distant
government
.
therefore
i
am
unable
to
recommend
proposition
involving
.
paramount
privilege
of
ownership
or
right
outside
of
our
own
territory
,
when
coupled
with
absolute
and
unlimited
engagement
to
defend
the
territorial
integrity
of
the
state
where
such
interest
lie
.
while
the
general
project
of
connecting
the
two

by
mean
of
a
canal
is
to
be
encouraged
,
i
am
of
opinion
that
any
scheme
to
that
end
to
be
considered
with
favor
should
be
free
from
the
