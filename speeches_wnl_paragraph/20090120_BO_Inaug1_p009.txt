we
remain
a
young
nation
,
but
in
the
word
of
scripture
,
the
time
ha
come
to
set
aside
childish
thing
.
the
time
ha
come
to
reaffirm
our
enduring
spirit
;
to
choose
our
better
history
;
to
carry
forward
that
precious
gift
,
that
noble
idea
,
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation
:
the
god-given
promise
that
all
are
equal
,
all
are
free
,
and
all
deserve
a
chance
to
pursue
their
full
measure
of
happiness
.
