economy
in
public
expenditure
is
a
duty
that
can
not
innocently
be
neglected
by
those
intrusted
with
the
control
of
money
drawn
from
the
people
for
public
us
.
it
must
be
confessed
that
our
apparently
endless
resource
,
the
familiarity
of
our
people
with
immense
accumulation
of
wealth
,
the
growing
sentiment
among
them
that
the
expenditure
of
public
money
should
in
some
manner
be
to
their
immediate
and
personal
advantage
,
the
indirect
and
almost
stealthy
manner
in
which
a
large
part
of
our
tax
is
exacted
,
and
a
degenerated
sense
of
official
accountability
have
led
to
growing
extravagance
in
governmental
appropriation
.
