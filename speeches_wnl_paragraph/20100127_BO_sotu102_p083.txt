we
must
continually
renew
this
promise
.
my
administration
ha
a
civil
right
division
that
is
once
again
prosecuting
civil
right
violation
and
employment
discrimination
.
we
finally
strengthened
our
law
to
protect
against
crime
driven
by
hate
.
this
year
,
i
will
work
with
congress
and
our
military
to
finally
repeal
the
law
that
denies
gay
american
the
right
to
serve
the
country
they
love
because
of
who
they
are
.
it
's
the
right
thing
to
do
.
