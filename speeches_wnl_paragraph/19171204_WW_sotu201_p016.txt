all
these
thing
have
been
true
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
stupendous
war
;
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
they
had
been
made
plain
at
the
very
outset
the
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
of
the
russian
people
might
have
been
once
for
all
enlisted
on
the
side
of
the
ally
,
suspicion
and
distrust
swept
away
,
and
a
real
and
lasting
union
of
purpose
effected
.
had
they
believed
these
thing
at
the
very
moment
of
their
revolution
and
had
they
been
confirmed
in
that
belief
since
,
the
sad
revers
which
have
recently
marked
the
progress
of
their
affair
towards
an
ordered
and
stable
government
of
free
men
might
have
been
avoided
.
the
russian
people
have
been
poisoned
by
the
very
same
falsehood
that
have
kept
the
german
people
in
the
dark
,
and
the
poison
ha
been
administered
by
the
very
same
hand
.
the
only
possible
antidote
is
the
truth
.
it
can
not
be
uttered
too
plainly
or
too
often
.
