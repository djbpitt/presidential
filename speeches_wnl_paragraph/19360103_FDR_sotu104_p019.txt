a
a
consistent
part
of
a
clear
policy
,
the
united
state
is
following
a
twofold
neutrality
toward
any
and
all
nation
which
engage
in
war
that
are
not
of
immediate
concern
to
the
america
.
first
,
we
decline
to
encourage
the
prosecution
of
war
by
permitting
belligerent
to
obtain
arm
,
ammunition
or
implement
of
war
from
the
united
state
.
second
,
we
seek
to
discourage
the
use
by
belligerent
nation
of
any
and
all
american
product
calculated
to
facilitate
the
prosecution
of
a
war
in
quantity
over
and
above
our
normal
export
of
them
in
time
of
peace
.
