we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
kind
of
life
our
child
would
have
to
lead
if
a
large
part
of
the
rest
of
the
world
were
compelled
to
worship
a
god
imposed
by
a
military
ruler
,
or
were
forbidden
to
worship
god
at
all
;
if
the
rest
of
the
world
were
forbidden
to
read
and
hear
the
facts—the
daily
news
of
their
own
and
other
nations—if
they
were
deprived
of
the
truth
that
make
men
free
.
