while
the
number
of
the
unemployed
ha
decreased
very
greatly
,
while
their
immediate
need
for
food
and
clothing-as
far
a
the
federal
government
is
concernedâ€”have
been
largely
met
,
while
their
morale
ha
been
kept
alive
by
giving
them
useful
public
work
,
we
have
not
yet
found
a
way
to
employ
the
surplus
of
our
labor
which
the
efficiency
of
our
industrial
process
ha
created
.
