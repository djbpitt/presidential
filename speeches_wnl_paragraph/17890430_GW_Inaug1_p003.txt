such
being
the
impression
under
which
i
have
,
in
obedience
to
the
public
summons
,
repaired
to
the
present
station
;
it
would
be
peculiarly
improper
to
omit
in
this
first
official
act
,
my
fervent
supplication
to
that
almighty
being
who
rule
over
the
universe
,
who
presides
in
the
council
of
nation
,
and
whose
providential
aid
can
supply
every
human
defect
,
that
his
benediction
may
consecrate
to
the
liberty
and
happiness
of
the
people
of
the
united
state
,
a
government
instituted
by
themselves
for
these
essential
purpose
:
and
may
enable
every
instrument
employed
in
it
administration
to
execute
with
success
,
the
function
allotted
to
his
charge
.
in
tendering
this
homage
to
the
great
author
of
every
public
and
private
good
,
i
assure
myself
that
it
express
your
sentiment
not
le
than
my
own
;
nor
those
of
my
fellow-citizens
at
large
,
le
than
either
.
no
people
can
be
bound
to
acknowledge
and
adore
the
invisible
hand
,
which
conduct
the
affair
of
men
more
than
the
people
of
the
united
state
.
every
step
,
by
which
they
have
advanced
to
the
character
of
an
independent
nation
,
seems
to
have
been
distinguished
by
some
token
of
providential
agency
.
and
in
the
important
revolution
just
accomplished
in
the
system
of
their
united
government
,
the
tranquil
deliberation
and
voluntary
consent
of
so
many
distinct
community
,
from
which
the
event
ha
resulted
,
can
not
be
compared
with
the
mean
by
which
most
government
have
been
established
,
without
some
return
of
pious
gratitude
along
with
an
humble
anticipation
of
the
future
blessing
which
the
past
seem
to
presage
.
these
reflection
,
arising
out
of
the
present
crisis
,
have
forced
themselves
too
strongly
on
my
mind
to
be
suppressed
.
you
will
join
with
me
i
trust
in
thinking
,
that
there
are
none
under
the
influence
of
which
,
the
proceeding
of
a
new
and
free
government
can
more
auspiciously
commence
.
