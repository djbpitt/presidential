right
now
there
's
a
bill
in
this
congress
that
would
give
every
responsible
homeowner
in
america
the
chance
to
save
$
3,000
a
year
by
refinancing
at
today
's
rate
.
democrat
and
republican
have
supported
it
before
,
so
what
are
we
waiting
for
?
take
a
vote
and
send
me
that
bill
.
why
areâ€”why
would
we
be
against
that
?
why
would
that
be
a
partisan
issue
,
helping
folk
refinance
?
right
now
overlapping
regulation
keep
responsible
young
family
from
buying
their
first
home
.
what
's
holding
u
back
?
let
's
streamline
the
process
and
help
our
economy
grow
.
