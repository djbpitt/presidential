hand
in
hand
with
this
we
must
frankly
recognize
the
overbalance
of
population
in
our
industrial
center
and
,
by
engaging
on
a
national
scale
in
a
redistribution
,
endeavor
to
provide
a
better
use
of
the
land
for
those
best
fitted
for
the
land
.
the
task
can
be
helped
by
definite
effort
to
raise
the
value
of
agricultural
product
and
with
this
the
power
to
purchase
the
output
of
our
city
.
it
can
be
helped
by
preventing
realistically
the
tragedy
of
the
growing
loss
through
foreclosure
of
our
small
home
and
our
farm
.
it
can
be
helped
by
insistence
that
the
federal
,
state
,
and
local
government
act
forthwith
on
the
demand
that
their
cost
be
drastically
reduced
.
it
can
be
helped
by
the
unifying
of
relief
activity
which
today
are
often
scattered
,
uneconomical
,
and
unequal
.
it
can
be
helped
by
national
planning
for
and
supervision
of
all
form
of
transportation
and
of
communication
and
other
utility
which
have
a
definitely
public
character
.
there
are
many
way
in
which
it
can
be
helped
,
but
it
can
never
be
helped
merely
by
talking
about
it
.
we
must
act
and
act
quickly
.
