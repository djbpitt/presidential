these
inevitable
entanglement
of
the
united
state
with
the
rebellion
in
cuba
,
the
large
american
property
interest
affected
,
and
consideration
of
philanthropy
and
humanity
in
general
have
led
to
a
vehement
demand
in
various
quarter
for
some
sort
of
positive
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
united
state
.
it
wa
at
first
proposed
that
belligerent
right
should
be
accorded
to
the
insurgent
--
a
proposition
no
longer
urged
because
untimely
and
in
practical
operation
dearly
perilous
and
injurious
to
our
own
interest
.
it
ha
since
been
and
is
now
sometimes
contended
that
the
independence
of
the
insurgent
should
be
recognized
;
but
imperfect
and
restricted
a
the
spanish
government
of
the
island
may
be
,
no
other
exists
there
,
unless
the
will
of
the
military
officer
in
temporary
command
of
a
particular
district
can
be
dignified
a
a
specie
of
government
.
it
is
now
also
suggested
that
the
united
state
should
buy
the
island
--
a
suggestion
possibly
worthy
of
consideration
if
there
were
any
evidence
of
a
desire
or
willingness
on
the
part
of
spain
to
entertain
such
a
proposal
.
it
is
urged
finally
that
,
all
other
method
failing
,
the
existing
internecine
strife
in
cuba
should
be
terminated
by
our
intervention
,
even
at
the
cost
of
a
war
between
the
united
state
and
spain
--
a
war
which
it
advocate
confidently
prophesy
could
neither
be
large
in
it
proportion
nor
doubtful
in
it
issue
.
