since
,
however
,
it
is
apparent
that
here
,
a
in
every
other
state
,
foreign
danger
necessarily
attend
domestic
difficulty
,
i
recommend
that
adequate
and
ample
measure
be
adopted
for
maintaining
the
public
defense
on
every
side
.
while
under
this
general
recommendation
provision
for
defending
our
seacoast
line
readily
occurs
to
the
mind
,
i
also
in
the
same
connection
ask
the
attention
of
congress
to
our
great
lake
and
river
.
it
is
believed
that
some
fortification
and
depot
of
arm
and
munition
,
with
harbor
and
navigation
improvement
,
all
at
well-selected
point
upon
these
,
would
be
of
great
importance
to
the
national
defense
and
preservation
.
i
ask
attention
to
the
view
of
the
secretary
of
war
,
expressed
in
his
report
,
upon
the
same
general
subject
.
