i
am
more
convinced
than
ever
that
we
can
have
no
assured
financial
peace
and
safety
until
the
government
currency
obligation
upon
which
gold
may
be
demanded
from
the
treasury
are
withdrawn
from
circulation
and
canceled
.
this
might
be
done
,
a
ha
been
heretofore
recommended
,
by
their
exchange
for
long-term
bond
bearing
a
low
rate
of
interest
or
by
their
redemption
with
the
proceeds
of
such
bond
.
even
if
only
the
united
state
note
known
a
greenback
were
thus
retired
it
is
probable
that
the
treasury
note
issued
in
payment
of
silver
purchase
under
the
act
of
july
14
,
1890
,
now
paid
in
gold
when
demanded
,
would
not
create
much
disturbance
,
a
they
might
from
time
to
time
,
when
received
in
the
treasury
by
redemption
in
gold
or
otherwise
,
be
gradually
and
prudently
replaced
by
silver
coin
.
