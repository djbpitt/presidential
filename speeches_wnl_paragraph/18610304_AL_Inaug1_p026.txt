if
a
minority
in
such
case
will
secede
rather
than
acquiesce
,
they
make
a
precedent
which
in
turn
will
divide
and
ruin
them
;
for
a
minority
of
their
own
will
secede
from
them
whenever
a
majority
refuse
to
be
controlled
by
such
minority
.
for
instance
,
why
may
not
any
portion
of
a
new
confederacy
a
year
or
two
hence
arbitrarily
secede
again
,
precisely
a
portion
of
the
present
union
now
claim
to
secede
from
it
?
all
who
cherish
disunion
sentiment
are
now
being
educated
to
the
exact
temper
of
doing
this
.
