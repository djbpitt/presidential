another
topic
in
which
our
people
rightfully
take
a
deep
interest
may
be
here
briefly
considered
.
i
refer
to
the
existence
of
trust
and
other
huge
aggregation
of
capital
the
object
of
which
is
to
secure
the
monopoly
of
some
particular
branch
of
trade
,
industry
,
or
commerce
and
to
stifle
wholesome
competition
.
when
these
are
defended
,
it
is
usually
on
the
ground
that
though
they
increase
profit
they
also
reduce
price
,
and
thus
may
benefit
the
public
.
it
must
be
remembered
,
however
,
that
a
reduction
of
price
to
the
people
is
not
one
of
the
real
object
of
these
organization
,
nor
is
their
tendency
necessarily
in
that
direction
.
if
it
occurs
in
a
particular
case
it
is
only
because
it
accord
with
the
purpose
or
interest
of
those
managing
the
scheme
.
