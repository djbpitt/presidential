it
is
to
the
same
end
that
,
in
pursuance
of
general
order
,
spanish
garrison
are
now
being
withdrawn
from
plantation
and
the
rural
population
required
to
concentrate
itself
in
the
town
.
the
sure
result
would
seem
to
be
that
the
industrial
value
of
the
island
is
fast
diminishing
and
that
unless
there
is
a
speedy
and
radical
change
in
existing
condition
it
will
soon
disappear
altogether
.
that
value
consists
very
largely
,
of
course
,
in
it
capacity
to
produce
sugar
--
a
capacity
already
much
reduced
by
the
interruption
to
tillage
which
have
taken
place
during
the
last
two
year
.
it
is
reliably
asserted
that
should
these
interruption
continue
during
the
current
year
,
and
practically
extend
,
a
is
now
threatened
,
to
the
entire
sugar-producing
territory
of
the
island
,
so
much
time
and
so
much
money
will
be
required
to
restore
the
land
to
it
normal
productiveness
that
it
is
extremely
doubtful
if
capital
can
be
induced
to
even
make
the
attempt
.
