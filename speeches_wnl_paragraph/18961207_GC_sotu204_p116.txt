a
a
sincere
friend
of
the
indian
,
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
that
these
reform
should
be
accomplished
with
the
consent
and
aid
of
the
tribe
and
that
no
necessity
may
be
presented
for
radical
or
drastic
legislation
i
hope
,
therefore
,
that
the
commission
now
conducting
negotiation
will
soon
be
able
to
report
that
progress
ha
been
made
toward
a
friendly
adjustment
of
existing
difficulty
.
