it
is
most
gratifying
to
note
the
satisfactory
result
that
have
followed
the
inauguration
of
the
new
system
provided
for
by
the
act
of
may
28
,
1896
,
under
which
certain
federal
official
are
compensated
by
salary
instead
of
fee
.
the
new
plan
wa
put
in
operation
on
the
1st
day
of
july
,
1896
,
and
already
the
great
economy
it
enforces
,
it
prevention
of
abuse
,
and
it
tendency
to
a
better
enforcement
of
the
law
are
strikingly
apparent
.
detailed
evidence
of
the
usefulness
of
this
long-delayed
but
now
happily
accomplished
reform
will
be
found
clearly
set
forth
in
the
attorney-general
's
report
.
