we
have
to
seek
new
market
aggressively
,
just
a
our
competitor
are
.
if
america
sits
on
the
sideline
while
other
nation
sign
trade
deal
,
we
will
lose
the
chance
to
create
job
on
our
shore
.
but
realizing
those
benefit
also
mean
enforcing
those
agreement
so
our
trading
partner
play
by
the
rule
.
and
that
's
why
we
'll
continue
to
shape
a
doha
trade
agreement
that
open
global
market
and
why
we
will
strengthen
our
trade
relation
in
asia
and
with
key
partner
like
south
korea
and
panama
and
colombia
.
