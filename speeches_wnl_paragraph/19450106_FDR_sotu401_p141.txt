we
have
house-cleaning
of
our
own
to
do
in
this
regard
.
but
it
is
our
hope
,
not
only
in
the
interest
of
our
own
prosperity
but
in
the
interest
of
the
prosperity
of
the
world
,
that
trade
and
commerce
and
access
to
material
and
market
may
be
freer
after
this
war
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
.
