defending
our
freedom
,
though
,
is
not
just
the
job
of
our
military
alone
.
we
must
all
do
our
part
to
make
sure
our
god-given
right
are
protected
here
at
home
.
that
includes
one
of
the
most
fundamental
right
of
a
democracy
:
the
right
to
vote
.
now
,
when
any
american
,
no
matter
where
they
live
or
what
their
party
,
are
denied
that
right
because
they
ca
n't
afford
to
wait
for
5
or
6
or
7
hour
just
to
cast
their
ballot
,
we
are
betraying
our
ideal
.
