entertain
a
strong
hope
that
the
state
of
the
national
finance
is
now
sufficiently
matured
to
enable
you
to
enter
upon
a
systematic
and
effectual
arrangement
for
the
regular
redemption
and
discharge
of
the
public
debt
,
according
to
the
right
which
ha
been
reserved
to
the
government
.
no
measure
can
be
more
desirable
,
whether
viewed
with
an
eye
to
it
intrinsic
importance
or
to
the
general
sentiment
and
wish
of
the
nation
.
