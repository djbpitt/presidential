this
service
ha
never
been
regulated
by
anything
but
the
most
indefinite
legal
enactment
and
the
most
unsatisfactory
rule
.
it
wa
many
year
ago
sanctioned
apparently
for
a
purpose
regarded
a
temporary
and
related
to
a
survey
of
our
coast
.
having
gained
a
place
in
the
appropriation
made
by
congress
,
it
ha
gradually
taken
to
itself
power
and
object
not
contemplated
in
it
creation
and
extended
it
operation
until
it
sadly
need
legislative
attention
