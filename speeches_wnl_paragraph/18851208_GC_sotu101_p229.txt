the
nation
ha
made
princely
grant
and
subsidy
to
a
system
of
railroad
projected
a
great
national
highway
to
connect
the
pacific
state
with
the
east
.
it
ha
been
charged
that
these
donation
from
the
people
have
been
diverted
to
private
gain
and
corrupt
us
,
and
thus
public
indignation
ha
been
aroused
and
suspicion
engendered
.
our
great
nation
doe
not
begrudge
it
generosity
,
but
it
abhors
speculation
and
fraud
;
and
the
favorable
regard
of
our
people
for
the
great
corporation
to
which
these
grant
were
made
can
only
be
revived
by
a
restoration
of
confidence
,
to
be
secured
by
their
constant
,
unequivocal

and
clearly
manifested
integrity

a
faithful
application
of
the
undiminished
proceeds
of
the
grant
to
the
construction
and
perfecting
of
their
road
,
an
honest
discharge
of
their
obligation
,
and
entire
justice
to
all
the
people
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
right
on
these
highway
of
travel
are
all
the
public
asks
,
and
it
will
be
content
with
no

to
secure
these
thing
should
be
the
common
purpose
of
the
officer
of
the
government
,
a
well
a
of
the
corporation

with
this
accomplishment
prosperity
would
be
permanently
secured
to
the
road
,
and
national
pride
would
take
the
place
of
national
complaint
