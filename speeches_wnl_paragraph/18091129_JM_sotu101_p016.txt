in
the
midst
of
the
wrong
and
vexation
experienced
from
external
cause
there
is
much
room
for
congratulation
on
the
prosperity
and
happiness
flowing
from
our
situation
at
home
.
the
blessing
of
health
ha
never
been
more
universal
.
the
fruit
of
the
season
,
though
in
particular
article
and
district
short
of
their
usual
redundancy
,
are
more
than
sufficient
for
our
want
and
our
comfort
.
the
face
of
our
country
every
present
evidence
of
laudable
enterprise
,
of
extensive
capital
,
and
of
durable
improvement
.
in
a
cultivation
of
the
material
and
the
extension
of
useful
manufacture
,
more
especially
in
the
general
application
to
household
fabric
,
we
behold
a
rapid
diminution
of
our
dependence
on
foreign
supply
.
nor
is
it
unworthy
of
reflection
that
this
revolution
in
our
pursuit
and
habit
is
in
no
slight
degree
a
consequence
of
those
impolitic
and
arbitrary
edict
by
which
the
contending
nation
,
in
endeavoring
each
of
them
to
obstruct
our
trade
with
the
other
,
have
so
far
abridged
our
mean
of
procuring
the
production
and
manufacture
of
which
our
own
are
now
taking
the
place
.
