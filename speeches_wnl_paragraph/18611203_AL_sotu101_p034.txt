three
modification
occur
to
me
,
either
of
which
,
i
think
,
would
be
an
improvement
upon
our
present
system
.
let
the
supreme
court
be
of
convenient
number
in
every
event
;
then
,
first
,
let
the
whole
country
be
divided
into
circuit
of
convenient
size
,
the
supreme
judge
to
serve
in
a
number
of
them
corresponding
to
their
own
number
,
and
independent
circuit
judge
be
provided
for
all
the
rest
;
or
,
secondly
,
let
the
supreme
judge
be
relieved
from
circuit
duty
and
circuit
judge
provided
for
all
the
circuit
;
or
,
thirdly
,
dispense
with
circuit
court
altogether
,
leaving
the
judicial
function
wholly
to
the
district
court
and
an
independent
supreme
court
.
