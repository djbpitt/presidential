the
expense
of
the
current
year
,
from
the
multiplied
operation
falling
within
it
,
have
necessarily
been
extensive
;
but
on
a
just
estimate
of
the
campaign
in
which
the
mass
of
them
ha
been
incurred
the
cost
will
not
be
found
disproportionate
to
the
advantage
which
have
been
gained
.
the
campaign
ha
,
indeed
,
in
it
latter
stage
in
one
quarter
been
le
favorable
than
wa
expected
,
but
in
addition
to
the
importance
of
our
naval
success
the
progress
of
the
campaign
ha
been
filled
with
incident
highly
honorable
to
the
american
arm
.
