and
i
want
to
cut
through
the
maze
of
confusing
training
program
so
that
from
now
on
,
people
like
jackie
have
one
program
,
one
web
site
,
and
one
place
to
go
for
all
the
information
and
help
that
they
need
.
it
is
time
to
turn
our
unemployment
system
into
a
reemployment
system
that
put
people
to
work
.
