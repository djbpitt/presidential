labor
is
prior
to
and
independent
of
capital
.
capital
is
only
the
fruit
of
labor
,
and
could
never
have
existed
if
labor
had
not
first
existed
.
labor
is
the
superior
of
capital
,
and
deserves
much
the
higher
consideration
.
capital
ha
it
right
,
which
are
a
worthy
of
protection
a
any
other
right
.
nor
is
it
denied
that
there
is
,
and
probably
always
will
be
,
a
relation
between
labor
and
capital
producing
mutual
benefit
.
the
error
is
in
assuming
that
the
whole
labor
of
community
exists
within
that
relation
.
a
few
men
own
capital
,
and
that
few
avoid
labor
themselves
,
and
with
their
capital
hire
or
buy
another
few
to
labor
for
them
.
a
large
majority
belong
to
neither
class
--
neither
work
for
others
nor
have
others
working
for
them
.
in
most
of
the
southern
state
a
majority
of
the
whole
people
of
all
color
are
neither
slave
nor
master
,
while
in
the
northern
a
large
majority
are
neither
hirer
nor
hired
.
men
,
with
their
family
--
wife
,
son
,
and
daughter
--
work
for
themselves
on
their
farm
,
in
their
house
,
and
in
their
shop
,
taking
the
whole
product
to
themselves
,
and
asking
no
favor
of
capital
on
the
one
hand
nor
of
hired
laborer
or
slave
on
the
other
.
it
is
not
forgotten
that
a
considerable
number
of
person
mingle
their
own
labor
with
capital
;
that
is
,
they
labor
with
their
own
hand
and
also
buy
or
hire
others
to
labor
for
them
;
but
this
is
only
a
mixed
and
not
a
distinct
class
.
no
principle
stated
is
disturbed
by
the
existence
of
this
mixed
class
.
