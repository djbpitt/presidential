i
especially
recommend
such
a
recasting
of
the
appropriation
by
congress
for
the
post-office
department
a
will
permit
the
postmaster-general
to
proceed
with
the
work
of
consolidating
post-offices
.
this
work
ha
already
been
entered
upon
sufficiently
to
fully
demonstrate
by
experiment
and
experience
that
such
consolidation
is
productive
of
better
service
,
larger
revenue
,
and
le
expenditure
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
further
advantage
of
gradually
withdrawing
post-offices
from
the
spoil
system
.
