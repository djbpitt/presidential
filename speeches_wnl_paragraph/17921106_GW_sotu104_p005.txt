in
the
course
of
the
attempt
which
have
been
made
some
valuable
citizen
have
fallen
victim
to
their
zeal
for
the
public
service
.
a
sanction
commonly
respected
even
among
savage
ha
been
found
in
this
instance
insufficient
to
protect
from
massacre
the
emissary
of
peace
.
it
will
,
i
presume
,
be
duly
considered
whether
the
occasion
doe
not
call
for
an
exercise
of
liberality
toward
the
family
of
the
deceased
.
