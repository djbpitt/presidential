all
that
mattered
that
day
wa
the
mission
.
no
one
thought
about
politics
.
no
one
thought
about
themselves
.
one
of
the
young
men
involved
in
the
raid
later
told
me
that
he
didn't
deserve
credit
for
the
mission
.
it
only
succeeded
,
he
said
,
because
every
single
member
of
that
unit
did
their
job
:
the
pilot
who
landed
the
helicopter
that
spun
out
of
control
,
the
translator
who
kept
others
from
entering
the
compound
,
the
troop
who
separated
the
woman
and
child
from
the
fight
,
the
seal
who
charged
up
the
stair
.
more
than
that
,
the
mission
only
succeeded
because
every
member
of
that
unit
trusted
each
other
,
because
you
ca
n't
charge
up
those
stair
into
darkness
and
danger
unless
you
know
that
there
's
somebody
behind
you
,
watching
your
back
.
