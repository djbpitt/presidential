on
the
issue
of
the
war
are
staked
our
national
sovereignty
on
the
high
sea
and
the
security
of
an
important
class
of
citizen
whose
occupation
give
the
proper
value
to
those
of
every
other
class
.
not
to
contend
for
such
a
stake
is
to
surrender
our
equality
with
other
power
on
the
element
common
to
all
and
to
violate
the
sacred
title
which
every
member

society
ha
to
it
protection

i
need
not
call
into
view
the
unlawfulness
of
the
practice
by
which
our
mariner
are
forced
at
the
will
of
every
cruising
officer
from
their
own
vessel
into
foreign
one
,
nor
paint
the
outrage
inseparable
from
it
.
the
proof
are
in
the
record
of
each
successive
administration
of
our
government
,
and
the
cruel
suffering
of
that
portion
of
the
american
people

found
their
way
to
every
bosom
not

to
the
sympathy
