the
condition
of
our
indian
population
continues
to
improve
and
the
proof
multiply
that
the
transforming
change
,
so
much
to
be
desired
,
which
shall
substitute
for
barbarism
enlightenment
and
civilizing
education
,
is
in
favorable
progress
.
our
relation
with
these
people
during
the
year
have
been
disturbed
by
no
serious
disorder
,
but
rather
marked
by
a
better
realization
of
their
true
interest
and
increasing
confidence
and
good
will
.
these
condition
testify
to
the
value
of
the
higher
tone
of
consideration
and
humanity
which
ha
governed
the
later
method
of
dealing
with
them
,
and
commend
it
continued
observance
.
