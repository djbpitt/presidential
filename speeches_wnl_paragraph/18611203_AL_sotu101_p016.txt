by
the
act
of
the
5th
of
august
last
congress
authorized
the
president
to
instruct
the
commander
of
suitable
vessel
to
defend
themselves
against
and
to
capture
pirate
.
this
authority
ha
been
exercised
in
a
single
instance
only
.
for
the
more
effectual
protection
of
our
extensive
and
valuable
commerce
in
the
eastern
sea
especially
,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
also
be
advisable
to
authorize
the
commander
of
sailing
vessel
to
recapture
any
prize
which
pirate
may
make
of
united
state
vessel
and
their
cargo
,
and
the
consular
court
now
established
by
law
in
eastern
country
to
adjudicate
the
case
in
the
event
that
this
should
not
be
objected
to
by
the
local
authority
.
