the
secretary
report
that
the
value
of
our
export
of
farm
product
during
the
last
fiscal
year
amounted
to
$
570,000,000
,
an
increase
of
$
17,000,000
over
those
of
the
year
immediately
preceding
.
this
statement
is
not
the
le
welcome
because
of
the
fact
that
,
notwithstanding
such
increase
,
the
proportion
of
exported
agricultural
product
to
our
total
export
of
all
description
fell
off
during
the
year
.
the
benefit
of
an
increase
in
agricultural
export
being
assured
,
the
decrease
in
it
proportion
to
our
total
export
is
the
more
gratifying
when
we
consider
that
it
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
such
total
export
for
the
year
increased
more
than
$
75,000,000
.
