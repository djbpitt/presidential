when
our
difference
are
forgotten
and
our
contest
of
political
opinion
are
no
longer
remembered
,
nothing
in
the
retrospect
of
our
public
service
will
be
a
fortunate
and
comforting
a
the
recollection
of
official
duty
well
performed
and
the
memory
of
a
constant
devotion
to
the
interest
of
our
confiding
fellow-countrymen
.
