in
the
hope
that
the
work
will
be
prosecuted
with
no
le
vigor
in
the
future
,
the
secretary
of
war
ha
submitted
an
estimate
by
which
,
if
allowed
,
there
will
be
provided
and
either
built
or
building
by
the
end
of
the
next
fiscal
year
such
additional
gun
,
mortar
,
gun
carriage
,
and
emplacement
a
will
represent
not
far
from
one-third
of
the
total
work
to
be
done
under
the
plan
adopted
for
our
coast
defense
,
thus
affording
a
prospect
that
the
entire
work
will
be
substantially
completed
within
six
year
.
in
le
time
than
that
,
however
,
we
shall
have
attained
a
marked
degree
of
security
.
