we
are
united
in
determination
that
this
war
shall
not
be
followed
by
another
interim
which
lead
to
new
disaster-
that
we
shall
not
repeat
the
tragic
error
of
ostrich
isolationismâ€”that
we
shall
not
repeat
the
excess
of
the
wild
twenty
when
this
nation
went
for
a
joy
ride
on
a
roller
coaster
which
ended
in
a
tragic
crash
.
