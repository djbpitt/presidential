in
several
oriental
country
generous
offer
have
been
made
of
premise
for
housing
the
legation
of
the
united
state
.
a
grant
of
land
for
that
purpose
wa
made
some
year
since
by
japan
,
and
ha
been
referred
to
in
the
annual
message
of
my
predecessor
.
the
siamese
government
ha
made
a
gift
to
the
united
state
of
commodious
quarter
in
bangkok
.
in
korea
the
late
minister
wa
permitted
to
purchase
a
building
from
the
government
for
legation
use
.
in
china
the
premise
rented
for
the
legation
are
favored
a
to
local
charge
.
at
tangier
the
house
occupied
by
our
representative
ha
been
for
many
year
the
property
;
this
government
,
having
been
given
for
that
purpose
in
1822
by
the
sultan
of
morocco
.
i
approve
the
suggestion
heretofore
made
,
that
,
view
of
the
condition
of
life
and
administration
in
the
eastern
country
,
the
legation
building
in
china
,
japan
,
korea
,
siam
,
and
perhaps
persia
,
should
be
owned
and
furnished
by
the
government
with
a
view
to
permanency
and
security
.
to
this
end
i
recommend
that
authority
be
given
to
accept
the
gift
adverted
to
in
japan
and
siam
,
and
to
purchase
in
the
other
country
named
,
with
provision
for
furniture
and
repair
.
a
considerable
saving
in
rental
would
result
.
