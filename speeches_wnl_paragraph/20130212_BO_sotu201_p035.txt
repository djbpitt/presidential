america
's
energy
sector
is
just
one
part
of
an
aging
infrastructure
badly
in
need
of
repair
.
ask
any
ceo
where
they
'd
rather
locate
and
hire
,
a
country
with
deteriorating
road
and
bridge
or
one
with
high-speed
rail
and
internet
,
high-tech
school
,
self-healing
power
grid
.
the
ceo
of
siemens
america—a
company
that
brought
hundred
of
new
job
to
north
carolina—said
that
if
we
upgrade
our
infrastructure
,
they
'll
bring
even
more
job
.
and
that
's
the
attitude
of
a
lot
of
company
all
around
the
world
.
and
i
know
you
want
these
job-creating
project
in
your
district
.
i
've
seen
all
those
ribbon-cuttings
.
