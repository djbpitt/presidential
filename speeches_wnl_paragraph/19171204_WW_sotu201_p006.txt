i
believe
that
i
speak
for
them
when
i
say
two
thing
:
first
,
that
this
intolerable
thing
of
which
the
master
of
germany
have
shown
u
the
ugly
face
,
this
menace
of
combined
intrigue
and
force
which
we
now
see
so
clearly
a
the
german
power
,
a
thing
without
conscience
or
honor
or
capacity
for
covenanted
peace
,
must
be
crushed
and
,
if
it
be
not
utterly
brought
to
an
end
,
at
least
shut
out
from
the
friendly
intercourse
of
the
nation
;
and
,
second
,
that
when
this
thing
and
it
power
are
indeed
defeated
and
the
time
come
that
we
can
discus
peace
--
when
the
german
people
have
spokesman
whose
word
we
can
believe
and
when
those
spokesman
are
ready
in
the
name
of
their
people
to
accept
the
common
judgment
of
the
nation
a
to
what
shall
henceforth
be
the
base
of
law
and
of
covenant
for
the
life
of
the
world
--
we
shall
be
willing
and
glad
to
pay
the
full
price
for
peace
,
and
pay
it
ungrudgingly
.
we
know
what
that
price
will
be
.
it
will
be
full
,
impartial
justice
--
justice
done
at
every
point
and
to
every
nation
that
the
final
settlement
must
affect
,
our
enemy
a
well
a
our
friend
.
