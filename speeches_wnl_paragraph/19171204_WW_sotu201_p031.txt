i
have
spoken
plainly
because
this
seems
to
me
the
time
when
it
is
most
necessary
to
speak
plainly
,
in
order
that
all
the
world
may
know
that
even
in
the
heat
and
ardor
of
the
struggle
and
when
our
whole
thought
is
of
carrying
the
war
through
to
it
end
we
have
not
forgotten
any
ideal
or
principle
for
which
the
name
of
america
ha
been
held
in
honor
among
the
nation
and
for
which
it
ha
been
our
glory
to
contend
in
the
great
generation
that
went
before
u
.
a
supreme
moment
of
history
ha
come
.
the
eye
of
the
people
have
been
opened
and
they
see
.
the
hand
of
god
is
laid
upon
the
nation
.
he
will
show
them
favor
,
i
devoutly
believe
,
only
if
they
rise
to
the
clear
height
of
his
own
justice
and
mercy
.
