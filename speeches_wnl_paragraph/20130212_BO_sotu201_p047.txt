so
tonight
i
ask
congress
to
change
the
higher
education
act
so
that
affordability
and
value
are
included
in
determining
which
college
receive
certain
type
of
federal
aid
.
and
tomorrow
my
administration
will
release
a
new
college
scorecard
that
parent
and
student
can
use
to
compare
school
based
on
a
simple
criterion
:
where
you
can
get
the
most
bang
for
your
educational
buck
.
