when
i
addressed
myself
to
performing
the
duty
laid
upon
the
president
by
the
constitution
to
present
to
you
an
annual
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
,
i
found
my
thought
dominated
by
an
immortal
sentence
of
abraham
lincoln's-
''
let
u
have
faith
that
right
make
might
,
and
in
that
faith
let
u
dare
to
do
our
duty
a
we
understand
it
''
-a
sentence
immortal
because
it
embodies
in
a
form
of
utter
simplicity
and
purity
the
essential
faith
of
the
nation
,
the
faith
in
which
it
wa
conceived
,
and
the
faith
in
which
it
ha
grown
to
glory
and
power
.
with
that
faith
and
the
birth
of
a
nation
founded
upon
it
came
the
hope
into
the
world
that
a
new
order
would
prevail
throughout
the
affair
of
mankind
,
an
order
in
which
reason
and
right
would
take
precedence
over
covetousness
and
force
;
and
i
believe
that
i
express
the
wish
and
purpose
of
every
thoughtful
american
when
i
say
that
this
sentence
mark
for
u
in
the
plainest
manner
the
part
we
should
play
alike
in
the
arrangement
of
our
domestic
affair
and
in
our
exercise
of
influence
upon
the
affair
of
the
world
.
