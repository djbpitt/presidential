it
is
,
of
course
,
true
that
the
record
of
past
century
includes
destruction
of
many
small
nation
,
the
enslavement
of
people
,
and
the
building
of
empire
on
the
foundation
of
force
.
but
wholly
apart
from
the
greater
international
morality
which
we
seek
today
,
we
recognize
the
practical
fact
that
with
modern
weapon
and
modern
condition
,
modern
man
can
no
longer
lead
a
civilized
life
if
we
are
to
go
back
to
the
practice
of
war
and
conquest
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
century
.
