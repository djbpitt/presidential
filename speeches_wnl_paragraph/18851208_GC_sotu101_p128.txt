when
the
time

that

will
be
apparent
the
difference
between

dollar

the

it
may
be
said
that
the

temporary

that
ultimately
the

adjusted

change
;

even
if

the
wage-worker
can
not

gain

must
inevitably
lose
,
since
the
price
he
is
compelled
to
pay
for
his
living
will
not
only
be
measured
in
a
coin
heavily
depreciated
and
fluctuating
and
uncertain
in
it
value
,
but
this
uncertainty
in
the
value
of
the
purchasing
medium
will
be
made
the
pretext
for
an
advance
in
price
beyond
that
justified
by
actual
depreciation
.
