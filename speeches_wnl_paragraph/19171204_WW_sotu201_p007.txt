you
catch
,
with
me
,
the
voice
of
humanity
that
are
in
the
air
.
they
grow
daily
more
audible
,
more
articulate
,
more
persuasive
,
and
they
come
from
the
heart
of
men
everywhere
.
they
insist
that
the
war
shall
not
end
in
vindictive
action
of
any
kind
;
that
no
nation
or
people
shall
be
robbed
or
punished
because
the
irresponsible
ruler
of
a
single
country
have
themselves
done
deep
and
abominable
wrong
.
it
is
this
thought
that
ha
been
expressed
in
the
formula
``
no
annexation
,
no
contribution
,
no
punitive
indemnity
.
''
just
because
this
crude
formula
express
the
instinctive
judgment
a
to
right
of
plain
men
everywhere
it
ha
been
made
diligent
use
of
by
the
master
of
german
intrigue
to
lead
the
people
of
russia
astray
,
and
the
people
of
every
other
country
their
agent
could
reach
,
in
order
that
a
premature
peace
might
be
brought
about
before
autocracy
ha
been
taught
it
final
and
convincing
lesson
,
and
the
people
of
the
world
put
in
control
of
their
own
destiny
.
