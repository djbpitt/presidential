i
commend
also
the
recommendation
that
appropriate
measure
be
taken
to
complete
the
adjustment
of
the
various
grant
made
to
the
state
for
internal
improvement
and
of
swamp
and
overflowed
land
,
a
well
a
to
adjudicate
and
finally
determine
the
validity
and
extent
of
the
numerous
private
land
claim
.
all
these
are
element
of
great
injustice
and
peril
to
the
settler
upon
the
locality
affected
;
and
now
that
their
existence
can
not
be
avoided
,
no
duty
is
more
pressing
than
to
fix
a
soon
a
possible
their
bound
and
terminate
the
threat
of
trouble
which
arise
from
uncertainty
.
