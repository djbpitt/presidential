it
is
not
my
purpose
to
review
our
discussion
with
foreign
state
,
because
,
whatever
might
be
their
wish
or
disposition
,
the
integrity
of
our
country
and
the
stability
of
our
government
mainly
depend
not
upon
them
,
but
on
the
loyalty
,
virtue
,
patriotism
,
and
intelligence
of
the
american
people
.
the
correspondence
itself
,
with
the
usual
reservation
,
is
herewith
submitted
.
