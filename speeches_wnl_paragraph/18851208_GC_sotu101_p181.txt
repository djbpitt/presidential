all
must
admit
the
importance
of
an
effective
navy
to
a
nation
like
ours
,
having
such
an
extended
seacoast
to
protect
;
and
yet
we
have
not
a
single
vessel
of
war
that
could
keep
the
sea
against
a
first-class
vessel
of
any
important
power
.
such
a
condition
ought
not
longer
to
continue
.
the
nation
that
can
not
resist
aggression
is
constantly
exposed
to
it
.
it
foreign
policy
is
of
necessity
weak
and
it
negotiation
are
conducted
with
disadvantage
because
it
is
not
in
condition
to
enforce
the
term
dictated
by
it
sense
of
right
and
justice
.
