while
there
is
no
expenditure
of
the
public
fund
which
the
people
more
cheerfully
approve
than
that
made
in
recognition
of
the
service
of
our
soldier
living
and
dead
,
the
sentiment
underlying
the
subject
should
not
be
vitiated
by
the
introduction
of
any
fraudulent
practice
.
therefore
it
is
fully
a
important
that
the
roll
should
be
cleansed
of
all
those
who
by
fraud
have
secured
a
place
thereon
a
that
meritorious
claim
should
be
speedily
examined
and
adjusted
.
the
reform
in
the
method
of
doing
the
business
of
this
bureau
which
have
lately
been
inaugurated
promise
better
result
in
both
these
direction
.
