but
we
ca
n't
stop
there
.
we
know
our
economy
is
stronger
when
our
wife
,
our
mother
,
our
daughter
can
live
their
life
free
from
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
free
from
the
fear
of
domestic
violence
.
today
the
senate
passed
the
``
violence
against
women's
act
''
that
joe
biden
originally
wrote
almost
20
year
ago
.
and
i
now
urge
the
house
to
do
the
same
.
good
job
,
joe
.
and
i
ask
this
congress
to
declare
that
woman
should
earn
a
living
equal
to
their
effort
,
and
finally
pas
the
``
paycheck
fairness
act
''
this
year
.
