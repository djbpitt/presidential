the
operation
of
wise
law
and
the
influence
of
civilization
constantly
tending
to
relieve
the
country
from
the
danger
of
indian
hostility
,
together
with
the
increasing
ability
of
the
state
,
through
the
efficiency
of
the
national
guard
organization
,
to
protect
their
citizen
from
domestic
violence
,
lead
to
the
suggestion
that
the
time
is
fast
approaching
when
there
should
be
a
reorganization
of
our
army
on
the
line
of
the
present
necessity
of
the
country
.
this
change
contemplates
neither
increase
in
number
nor
added
expense
,
but
a
redistribution
of
the
force
and
an
encouragement
of
measure
tending
to
greater
efficiency
among
the
men
and
improvement
of
the
service
.
