now
,
i
'm
confident
a
farmer
can
contain
a
milk
spill
without
a
federal
agency
looking
over
his
shoulder
.
absolutely
.
but
i
will
not
back
down
from
making
sure
an
oil
company
can
contain
the
kind
of
oil
spill
we
saw
in
the
gulf
2
year
ago
.
i
will
not
back
down
from
protecting
our
kid
from
mercury
poisoning
or
making
sure
that
our
food
is
safe
and
our
water
is
clean
.
i
will
not
go
back
to
the
day
when
health
insurance
company
had
unchecked
power
to
cancel
your
policy
,
deny
your
coverage
,
or
charge
woman
differently
than
men
.
