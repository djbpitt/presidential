our
very
popular
and
estimable
representative
in
egypt
died
in
april
last
.
an
unpleasant
altercation
which
arose
between
the
temporary
incumbent
of
the
office
and
the
government
of
the
pasha
resulted
in
a
suspension
of
intercourse
.
the
evil
wa
promptly
corrected
on
the
arrival
of
the
successor
in
the
consulate
,
and
our
relation
with
egypt
,
a
well
a
our
relation
with
the
barbary
power
,
are
entirely
satisfactory
.
