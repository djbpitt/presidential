the
basic
thought
that
guide
these
specific
mean
of
national
recovery
is
not
narrowly
nationalistic
.
it
is
the
insistence
,
a
a
first
consideration
,
upon
the
interdependence
of
the
various
element
in
and
part
of
the
united
states-a
recognition
of
the
old
and
permanently
important
manifestation
of
the
american
spirit
of
the
pioneer
.
it
is
the
way
to
recovery
.
it
is
the
immediate
way
.
it
is
the
strongest
assurance
that
the
recovery
will
endure
.
