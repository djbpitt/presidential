nineteen
hundred
seventy-two
is
now
before
u
.
it
hold
precious
time
in
which
to
accomplish
good
for
the
nation
.
we
must
not
waste
it
.
i
know
the
political
pressure
in
this
session
of
the
congress
will
be
great
.
there
are
more
candidate
for
the
presidency
in
this
chamber
today
than
there
probably
have
been
at
any
one
time
in
the
whole
history
of
the
republic
.
and
there
is
an
honest
difference
of
opinion
,
not
only
between
the
party
,
but
within
each
party
,
on
some
foreign
policy
issue
and
on
some
domestic
policy
issue
.
