when
we
contemplate
the
war
on
our
frontier
,
it
may
be
truly
affirmed
that
every
reasonable
effort
ha
been
made
to
adjust
the
cause
of
dissension
with
the
indian
north
of
the
ohio
.
the
instruction
given
to
the
commissioner
evince
a
moderation
and
equity
proceeding
from
a
sincere
love
of
peace
,
and
a
liberality
having
no
restriction
but
the
essential
interest
and
dignity
of
the
united
state
.
the
attempt
,
however
,
of
an
amicable
negotiation
having
been
frustrated
,
the
troop
have
marched
to
act
offensively
.
although
the
proposed
treaty
did
not
arrest
the
progress
of
military
preparation
,
it
is
doubtful
how
far
the
advance
of
the
season
,
before
good
faith
justified
active
movement
,
may
retard
them
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
.
from
the
paper
and
intelligence
which
relate
to
this
important
subject
you
will
determine
whether
the
deficiency
in
the
number
of
troop
granted
by
law
shall
be
compensated
by
succor
of
militia
,
or
additional
encouragement
shall
be
proposed
to
recruit
.
