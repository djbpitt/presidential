whatever
argument
may
be
drawn
from
particular
example
superficially
viewed
,
a
thorough
examination
of
the
subject
will
evince
that
the
art
of
war
is
at
once
comprehensive
and
complicated
,
that
it
demand
much
previous
study
,
and
that
the
possession
of
it
in
it
most
improved
and
perfect
state
is
always
of
great
moment
to
the
security
of
a
nation
.
this
,
therefore
,
ought
to
be
a
serious
care
of
every
government
,
and
for
this
purpose
an
academy
where
a
regular
course
of
instruction
is
given
is
an
obvious
expedient
which
different
nation
have
successfully
employed
.
