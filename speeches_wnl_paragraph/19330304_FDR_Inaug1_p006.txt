true
they
have
tried
,
but
their
effort
have
been
cast
in
the
pattern
of
an
outworn
tradition
.
faced
by
failure
of
credit
they
have
proposed
only
the
lending
of
more
money
.
stripped
of
the
lure
of
profit
by
which
to
induce
our
people
to
follow
their
false
leadership
,
they
have
resorted
to
exhortation
,
pleading
tearfully
for
restored
confidence
.
they
know
only
the
rule
of
a
generation
of
self-seeker
.
they
have
no
vision
,
and
when
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
.
