annual
report
exhibiting
the
condition
of
our
agriculture
,
commerce
,
and
manufacture
would
present
a
fund
of
information
of
great
practical
value
to
the
country
.
while
i
make
no
suggestion
a
to
detail
,
i
venture
the
opinion
that
an
agricultural
and
statistical
bureau
might
profitably
be
organized
.
