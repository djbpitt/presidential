pending
these
occurrence
a
question
of
much
importance
wa
presented
by
decree
of
the
colombian
government
proclaiming
the
closure
of
certain
port
then
in
the
hand
of
insurgent
and
declaring
vessel
held
by
the
revolutionist
to
be
piratical
and
liable
to
capture
by
any
power
.
to
neither
of
these
proposition
could
the
united
state
assent
.
an
effective
closure
of
port
not
in
the
possession
of
the
government
,
but
held
by
hostile
partisan
,
could
not
be
recognized
;
neither
could
the
vessel
of
insurgent
against
the
legitimate
sovereignty
be
deemed
hostes
humani
generis
within
the
precept
of
international
law
,
whatever
might
be
the
definition
and
penalty
of
their
act
under
the
municipal
law
of
the
state
against
whose
authority
they
were
in
revolt
.
the
denial
by
this
government
of
the
colombian
proposition
did
not
,
however
,
imply
the
admission
of
a
belligerent
status
on
the
part
of
the
insurgent
.
