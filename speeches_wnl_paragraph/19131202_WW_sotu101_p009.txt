it
ha
,
singularly
enough
,
come
to
pas
that
we
have
allowed
the
industry
of
our
farm
to
lag
behind
the
other
activity
of
the
country
in
it
development
.
i
need
not
stop
to
tell
you
how
fundamental
to
the
life
of
the
nation
is
the
production
of
it
food
.
our
thought
may
ordinarily
be
concentrated
upon
the
city
and
the
hive
of
industry
,
upon
the
cry
of
the
crowded
market
place
and
the
clangor
of
the
factory
,
but
it
is
from
the
quiet
interspaces
of
the
open
valley
and
the
free
hillside
that
we
draw
the
source
of
life
and
of
prosperity
,
from
the
farm
and
the
ranch
,
from
the
forest
and
the
mine
.
without
these
every
street
would
be
silent
,
every
office
deserted
,
every
factory
fallen
into
disrepair
.
and
yet
the
farmer
doe
not
stand
upon
the
same
footing
with
the
forester
and
the
miner
in
the
market
of
credit
.
he
is
the
servant
of
the
season
.
nature
determines
how
long
he
must
wait
for
his
crop
,
and
will
not
be
hurried
in
her
process
.
he
may
give
his
note
,
but
the
season
of
it
maturity
depends
upon
the
season
when
his
crop
matures
,
lie
at
the
gate
of
the
market
where
his
product
are
sold
.
and
the
security
he
give
is
of
a
character
not
known
in
the
broker
's
office
or
a
familiarly
a
it
might
be
on
the
counter
of
the
banker
.
