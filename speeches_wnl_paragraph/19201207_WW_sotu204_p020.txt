i
have
not
so
much
laid
before
you
a
series
of
recommendation
,
gentleman
,
a
sought
to
utter
a
confession
of
faith
,
of
the
faith
in
which
i
wa
bred
and
which
it
is
my
solemn
purpose
to
stand
by
until
my
last
fighting
day
.
i
believe
this
to
be
the
faith
of
america
,
the
faith
of
the
future
,
and
of
all
the
victory
which
await
national
action
in
the
day
to
come
,
whether
in
america
or
elsewhere
.
