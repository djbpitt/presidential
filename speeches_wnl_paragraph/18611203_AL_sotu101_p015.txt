i
repeat
the
recommendation
of
my
predecessor
in
his
annual
message
to
congress
in
december
last
in
regard
to
the
disposition
of
the
surplus
which
will
probably
remain
after
satisfying
the
claim
of
american
citizen
against
china
,
pursuant
to
the
award
of
the
commissioner
under
the
act
of
the
3d
of
march
,
1859
.
if
,
however
,
it
should
not
be
deemed
advisable
to
carry
that
recommendation
into
effect
,
i
would
suggest
that
authority
be
given
for
investing
the
principal
,
over
the
proceeds
of
the
surplus
referred
to
,
in
good
security
,
with
a
view
to
the
satisfaction
of
such
other
just
claim
of
our
citizen
against
china
a
are
not
unlikely
to
arise
hereafter
in
the
course
of
our
extensive
trade
with
that
empire
.
