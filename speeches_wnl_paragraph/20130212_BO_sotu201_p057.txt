this
single
step
would
raise
the
income
of
million
of
working
family
.
it
could
mean
the
difference
between
grocery
or
the
food
bank
,
rent
or
eviction
,
scraping
by
or
finally
getting
ahead
.
for
business
across
the
country
,
it
would
mean
customer
with
more
money
in
their
pocket
.
and
a
whole
lot
of
folk
out
there
would
probably
need
le
help
from
government
.
in
fact
,
working
folk
should
n't
have
to
wait
year
after
year
for
the
minimum
wage
to
go
up
while
ceo
pay
ha
never
been
higher
.
so
here
's
an
idea
that
governor
romney
and
i
actually
agreed
on
last
year
:
let
's
tie
the
minimum
wage
to
the
cost
of
living
so
that
it
finally
becomes
a
wage
you
can
live
on
.
