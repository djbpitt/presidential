their
weapon
is
the
weapon
of
fear
.
i
have
said
,
``
the
only
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
itself
.
''
that
is
a
true
today
a
it
wa
in
1933
.
but
such
fear
a
they
instill
today
is
not
a
natural
fear
,
a
normal
fear
;
it
is
a
synthetic
,
manufactured
,
poisonous
fear
that
is
being
spread
subtly
,
expensively
and
cleverly
by
the
same
people
who
cried
in
those
other
day
,
``
save
u
,
save
u
,
lest
we
perish
