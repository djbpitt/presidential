i
am
sure
that
secular
education
and
moral
and
religious
teaching
must
be
important
factor
in
any
effort
to
save
the
indian
and
lead
him
to
civilization
.
i
believe
,
too
,
that
the
relinquishment
of
tribal
relation
and
the
holding
of
land
in
severalty
may
in
favorable
condition
aid
this
consummation
.
it
seems
to
me
,
however
,
that
allotment
of
land
in
severalty
ought
to
be
made
with
great
care
and
circumspection
.
if
hastily
done
,
before
the
indian
know
it
meaning
,
while
yet
he
ha
little
or
no
idea
of
tilling
a
farm
and
no
conception
of
thrift
,
there
is
great
danger
that
a
reservation
life
in
tribal
relation
may
be
exchanged
for
the
pauperism
of
civilization
instead
of
it
independence
and
elevation
.
