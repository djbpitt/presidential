question
concerning
our
citizen
in
turkey
may
be
affected
by
the
porte's
nonacquiescence
in
the
right
of
expatriation
and
by
the
imposition
of
religious
test
a
a
condition
of
residence
,
in
which
this
government
can
not
concur
.
the
united
state
must
hold
in
their
intercourse
with
every
power
that
the
status
of
their
citizen
is
to
be
respected
and
equal
civil
privilege
accorded
to
them
without
regard
to
creed
,
and
affected
by
no
consideration
save
those
growing
out
of
domiciliary
return
to
the
land
of
original
allegiance
or
of
unfulfilled
personal
obligation
which
may
survive
,
under
municipal
law
,
after
such
voluntary
return
.
