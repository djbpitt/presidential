a
year
ago
general
pardon
and
amnesty
,
upon
specified
term
,
were
offered
to
all
except
certain
designated
class
,
and
it
wa
at
the
same
time
made
known
that
the
excepted
class
were
still
within
contemplation
of
special
clemency
.
during
the
year
many
availed
themselves
of
the
general
provision
,
and
many
more
would
,
only
that
the
sign
of
bad
faith
in
some
led
to
such
precautionary
measure
a
rendered
the
practical
process
le
easy
and
certain
.
during
the
same
time
also
special
pardon
have
been
granted
to
individual
of
the
excepted
class
,
and
no
voluntary
application
ha
been
denied
.
thus
practically
the
door
ha
been
for
a
full
year
open
to
all
except
such
a
were
not
in
condition
to
make
free
choice
;
that
is
,
such
a
were
in
custody
or
under
constraint
.
it
is
still
so
open
to
all
.
but
the
time
may
come
,
probably
will
come
,
when
public
duty
shall
demand
that
it
be
closed
and
that
in
lieu
more
rigorous
measure
than
heretofore
shall
be
adopted
.
in
presenting
the
abandonment
of
armed
resistance
to
the
national
authority
on
the
part
of
the
insurgent
a
the
only
indispensable
condition
to
ending
the
war
on
the
part
of
the
government
,
i
retract
nothing
heretofore
said
a
to
slavery
.
i
repeat
the
declaration
made
a
year
a
ago
,
that
``
while
i
remain
in
my
present
position
i
shall
not
attempt
to
retract
or
modify
the
emancipation
proclamation
,
nor
shall
i
return
to
slavery
any
person
who
is
free
by
the
term
of
that
proclamation
or
by
any
of
the
act
of
congress
.
''
if
the
people
should
,
by
whatever
mode
or
mean
,
make
it
an
executive
duty
to
reenslave
such
person
,
another
,
and
not
i
,
must
be
their
instrument
to
perform
it
.
in
stating
a
single
condition
of
peace
i
mean
simply
to
say
that
the
war
will
cease
on
the
part
of
the
government
whenever
it
shall
have
ceased
on
the
part
of
those
who
began
it
.
