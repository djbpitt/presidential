the
situation
in
which
i
now
stand
for
the
last
time
,
in
the
midst
of
the
representative
of
the
people
of
the
united
state
,
naturally
recall
the
period
when
the
administration
of
the
present
form
of
government
commenced
,
and
i
can
not
omit
the
occasion
to
congratulate
you
and
my
country
on
the
success
of
the
experiment
,
nor
to
repeat
my
fervent
supplication
to
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
and
sovereign
arbiter
of
nation
that
his
providential
care
may
still
be
extended
to
the
united
state
,
that
the
virtue
and
happiness
of
the
people
may
be
preserved
,
and
that
the
government
which
they
have
instituted
for
the
protection
of
their
liberty
may
be
perpetual
.
