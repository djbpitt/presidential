we
do
not
distrust
the
future
of
essential
democracy
.
the
people
of
the
united
state
have
not
failed
.
in
their
need
they
have
registered
a
mandate
that
they
want
direct
,
vigorous
action
.
they
have
asked
for
discipline
and
direction
under
leadership
.
they
have
made
me
the
present
instrument
of
their
wish
.
in
the
spirit
of
the
gift
i
take
it
.
