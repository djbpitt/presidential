the
most
remarkable
feature
in
the
military
operation
of
the
year
is
general
sherman's
attempted
march
of
300
mile
directly
through
the
insurgent
region
.
it
tends
to
show
a
great
increase
of
our
relative
strength
that
our
general
in
chief
should
feel
able
to
confront
and
hold
in
check
every
active
force
of
the
enemy
,
and
yet
to
detach
a
well-appointed
large
army
to
move
on
such
an
expedition
.
the
result
not
yet
being
known
,
conjecture
in
regard
to
it
is
not
here
indulged
.
