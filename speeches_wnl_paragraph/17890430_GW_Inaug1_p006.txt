besides
the
ordinary
object
submitted
to
your
care
,
it
will
remain
with
your
judgment
to
decide
,
how
far
an
exercise
of
the
occasional
power
delegated
by
the
fifth
article
of
the
constitution
is
rendered
expedient
at
the
present
juncture
by
the
nature
of
objection
which
have
been
urged
against
the
system
,
or
by
the
degree
of
inquietude
which
ha
given
birth
to
them
.
instead
of
undertaking
particular
recommendation
on
this
subject
,
in
which
i
could
be
guided
by
no
light
derived
from
official
opportunity
,
i
shall
again
give
way
to
my
entire
confidence
in
your
discernment
and
pursuit
of
the
public
good
:
for
i
assure
myself
that
whilst
you
carefully
avoid
every
alteration
which
might
endanger
the
benefit
of
an
united
and
effective
government
,
or
which
ought
to
await
the
future
lesson
of
experience
;
a
reverence
for
the
characteristic
right
of
freeman
,
and
a
regard
for
the
public
harmony
,
will
sufficiently
influence
your
deliberation
on
the
question
how
far
the
former
can
be
more
impregnably
fortified
,
or
the
latter
be
safely
and
advantageously
promoted
.
