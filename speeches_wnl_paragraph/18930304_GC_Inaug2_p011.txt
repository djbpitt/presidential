the
verdict
of
our
voter
which
condemned
the
injustice
of
maintainingprotection
for
protection

enjoins
upon
the
people
's
servant
theduty
of
exposing
and
destroying
the
brood
of
kindred
evil
which
are
theunwholesome
progeny
of
paternalism
.
this
is
the
bane
of
republican
institutionsand
the
constant
peril
of
our
government
by
the
people
.
it
degrades
tothe

the
plan
of
rule
our
father
established
andbequeathed
to
u
a
an
object
of
our
love
and
veneration
.
it
pervert
thepatriotic
sentiment
of
our

and
tempts
them
to
pitiful
calculationof
the
sordid
gain
to
be
derived
from

.
itundermines
the

it
stifle
