i
have
often
said
that
there
are
no
two
front
for
america
in
this
war
.
there
is
only
one
front
.
there
is
one
line
of
unity
which
extends
from
the
heart
of
the
people
at
home
to
the
men
of
our
attacking
force
in
our
farthest
outpost
.
when
we
speak
of
our
total
effort
,
we
speak
of
the
factory
and
the
field
,
and
the
mine
a
well
a
of
the
battleground
--
we
speak
of
the
soldier
and
the
civilian
,
the
citizen
and
his
government
.
