at
your
late
session
a
joint
resolution
wa
adopted
authorizing
the
president
to
take
measure
for
facilitating
a
proper
representation
of
the
industrial
interest
of
the
united
state
at
the
exhibition
of
the
industry
of
all
nation
to
be
holden
at
london
in
the
year
1862
.
i
regret
to
say
i
have
been
unable
to
give
personal
attention
to
this
subject
--
a
subject
at
once
so
interesting
in
itself
and
so
extensively
and
intimately
connected
with
the
material
prosperity
of
the
world
.
through
the
secretary
of
state
and
of
the
interior
a
plan
or
system
ha
been
devised
and
partly
matured
,
and
which
will
be
laid
before
you
.
