in
our
disillusionment
after
the
last
war
we
preferred
international
anarchy
to
international
cooperation
with
nation
which
did
not
see
and
think
exactly
a
we
did
.
we
gave
up
the
hope
of
gradually
achieving
a
better
peace
because
we
had
not
the
courage
to
fulfill
our
responsibility
in
an
admittedly
imperfect
world
.
