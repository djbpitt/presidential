among
the
incident
to
the
measure
of
the
war
i
am
constrained
to
advert
to
the
refusal
of
the
governor
of
maine
and
connecticut
to
furnish
the
required
detachment
of
militia
toward
the
defense
of
the
maritime
frontier
.
the
refusal
wa
founded
on
a
novel
and
unfortunate
exposition
of
the
provision
of
the
constitution
relating
to
the
militia
.
the
correspondence
which
will
be
laid
before
you
contain
the
requisite
information
on
the
subject
.
it
is
obvious
that
if
the
authority
of
the
united
state
to
call
into
service
and
command
the
militia
for
the
public
defense
can
be
thus
frustrated
,
even
in
a
state
of
declared
war
and
of
course
under
apprehension
of
invasion
preceding
war
,
they
are
not
one
nation
for
the
purpose
most
of
all
requiring
it
,
and
that
the
public
safety
may
have
no
other
resource
than
in
those
large
and
permanent
military
establishment
which
are
forbidden
by
the
principle
of
our
free
government
,
and
against
the
necessity
of
which
the
militia
were
meant
to
be
a
constitutional
bulwark
.
