from
a
statement
which
will
be
made
by
the
secretary
of
war
it
will
be
seen
that
the
fortification
on
our
maritime
frontier
are
in
many
of
the
port
completed
,
affording
the
defense
which
wa
contemplated
,
and
that
a
further
time
will
be
required
to
render
complete
the
work
in
the
harbor
of
new
york
and
in
some
other
place
.
by
the
enlargement
of
the
work
and
the
employment
of
a
greater
number
of
hand
at
the
public
armory
the
supply
of
small
arm
of
an
improving
quality
appears
to
be
annually
increasing
at
a
rate
that
,
with
those
made
on
private
contract
,
may
be
expected
to
go
far
toward
providing
for
the
public
exigency
.
