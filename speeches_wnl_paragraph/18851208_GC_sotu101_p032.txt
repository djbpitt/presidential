the
condition
of
the
chinese
question
in
the
western
state
and
territory
is
,
despite
this
restrictive
legislation
,
far
from
being
satisfactory
.
the
recent
outbreak
in
wyoming
territory
,
where
number
of
unoffending
chinaman
,
indisputably
within
the
protection
of
the
treaty
and
the
law
,
were
murdered
by
a
mob
,
and
the
still
more
recent
threatened
outbreak
of
the
same
character
in
washington
territory
,
are
fresh
in
the
mind
of
all
,
and
there
is
apprehension
lest
the
bitterness
of
feeling
against
the
mongolian
race
on
the
pacific
slope
may
find
vent
in
similar
lawless
demonstration
.
all
the
power
of
this
government
should
be
exerted
to
maintain
the
amplest
good
faith
toward
china
in
the
treatment
of
these
men
,
and
the
inflexible
sternness
of
the
law
in
bringing
the
wrongdoer
to
justice
should
be
insisted
upon
.
