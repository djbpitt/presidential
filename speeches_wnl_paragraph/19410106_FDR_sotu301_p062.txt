men
do
not
live
by
bread
alone
,
they
do
not
fight
by
armament
alone
.
those
who
man
our
defense
,
and
those
behind
them
who
build
our
defense
,
must
have
the
stamen
and
the
courage
which
come
from
unshakable
belief
in
the
manner
of
life
which
they
are
defending
.
the
mighty
action
that
we
are
calling
for
can
not
be
based
on
a
disregard
of
all
thing
worth
fighting
for
.
