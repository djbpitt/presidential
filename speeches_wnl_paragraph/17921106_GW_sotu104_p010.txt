i
have
reason
to
believe
that
every
practicable
exertion
ha
been
made
(
pursuant
to
the
provision
by
law
for
that
purpose
)
to
be
prepared
for
the
alternative
of
a
prosecution
of
the
war
in
the
event
of
a
failure
of
pacific
overture
.
a
large
proportion
of
the
troop
authorized
to
be
raised
have
been
recruited
,
though
the
number
is
still
incomplete
,
and
pain
have
been
taken
to
discipline
and
put
them
in
condition
for
the
particular
kind
of
service
to
be
performed
.
a
delay
of
operation
(
besides
being
dictated
by
the
measure
which
were
pursuing
toward
a
pacific
termination
of
the
war
)
ha
been
in
itself
deemed
preferable
to
immature
effort
.
a
statement
from
the
proper
department
with
regard
to
the
number
of
troop
raised
,
and
some
other
point
which
have
been
suggested
,
will
afford
more
precise
information
a
a
guide
to
the
legislative
consultation
,
and
among
other
thing
will
enable
congress
to
judge
whether
some
additional
stimulus
to
the
recruiting
service
may
not
be
advisable
.
