today
we
reconsecrate
our
country
to
long-cherished
ideal
in
a
suddenly
changed
civilization
.
in
every
land
there
are
always
at
work
force
that
drive
men
apart
and
force
that
draw
men
together
.
in
our
personal
ambition
we
are
individualist
.
but
in
our
seeking
for
economic
and
political
progress
a
a
nation
,
we
all
go
up
,
or
else
we
all
go
down
,
a
one
people
.
