nor
is
the
question
before
u
whether
the
market
is
a
force
for
good
or
ill.
it
power
to
generate
wealth
and
expand
freedom
is
unmatched
,
but
this
crisis
ha
reminded
u
that
without
a
watchful
eye
,
the
market
can
spin
out
of
control—and
that
a
nation
can
not
prosper
long
when
it
favor
only
the
prosperous
.
the
success
of
our
economy
ha
always
depended
not
just
on
the
size
of
our
gross
domestic
product
,
but
on
the
reach
of
our
prosperity
;
on
our
ability
to
extend
opportunity
to
every
willing
heart—not
out
of
charity
,
but
because
it
is
the
surest
route
to
our
common
good
.
