if
i
have
overlooked
anything
that
ought
to
be
done
for
the
more
effective
conduct
of
the
war
,
your
own
counsel
will
supply
the
omission
.
what
i
am
perfectly
clear
about
is
that
in
the
present
session
of
the
congress
our
whole
attention
and
energy
should
be
concentrated
on
the
vigorous
,
rapid
,
and
successful
prosecution
of
the
great
task
of
winning
the
war
.
