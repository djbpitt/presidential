in
may
of
the
present
year
a
small
portion
of
the
chiricahua
apache
on
the
white
mountain
reservation
,
in
arizona
,
left
the
reservation
and
committed
a
number
of
murder
and
depredation
upon
settler
in
that
neighborhood
.
though
prompt
and
energetic
action
wa
taken
by
the
military
,
the
renegade
eluded
capture
and
escaped
into
mexico
.
the
formation
of
the
country
through
which
these
indian
passed
,
their
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
same
,
the
speed
of
their
escape
,
and
the
manner
in
which
they
scattered
and
concealed
themselves
among
the
mountain
near
the
scene
of
their
outrage
put
our
soldier
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
their
effort
to
capture
them
,
though
the
expectation
is
still
entertained
that
they
will
be
ultimately
taken
and
punished
for
their
crime
.
