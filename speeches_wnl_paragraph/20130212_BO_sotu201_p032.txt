now
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
natural
gas
boom
ha
led
to
cleaner
power
and
greater
energy
independence
.
we
need
to
encourage
that
.
and
that
's
why
my
administration
will
keep
cutting
redtape
and
speeding
up
new
oil
and
gas
permit
.
that
's
got
to
be
part
of
an
all-of-the-above
plan
.
but
i
also
want
to
work
with
this
congress
to
encourage
the
research
and
technology
that
help
natural
gas
burn
even
cleaner
and
protects
our
air
and
our
water
.
