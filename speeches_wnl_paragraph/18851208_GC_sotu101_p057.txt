a
question
arose
with
hayti
during
the
past
year
by
reason
of
the
exceptional
treatment
of
an
american
citizen
,
mr.
van
bokkelen
,
a
resident
of
port-au-prince
,
who
,
on
suit
by
creditor
residing
in
the
united
state
,
wa
sentenced
to
imprisonment
,
and
,
under
the
operation
of
a
haytian
statute
,
wa
denied
relief
secured
to
a
native
haytian
.
this
government
asserted
his
treaty
right
to
equal
treatment
with
native
of
hayti
in
all
suit
at
law
.
our
contention
wa
denied
by
the
haytian
government
,
which
,
however
,
while
still
professing
to
maintain
the
ground
taken
against
mr.
van
bokkelen
's
right
,
terminated
the
controversy
by
setting
him
at
liberty
without
explanation
.
