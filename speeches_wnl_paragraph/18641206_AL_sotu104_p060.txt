at
the
last
session
of
congress
a
proposed
amendment
of
the
constitution
abolishing
slavery
throughout
the
united
state
passed
the
senate
,
but
failed
for
lack
of
the
requisite
two-thirds
vote
in
the
house
of
representative
.
although
the
present
is
the
same
congress
and
nearly
the
same
member
,
and
without
questioning
the
wisdom
or
patriotism
of
those
who
stood
in
opposition
,
i
venture
to
recommend
the
reconsideration
and
passage
of
the
measure
at
the
present
session
.
of
course
the
abstract
question
is
not
changed
;
but
in
intervening
election
show
almost
certainly
that
the
next
congress
will
pas
the
measure
if
this
doe
not
.
hence
there
is
only
a
question
of
time
a
to
when
the
proposed
amendment
will
go
to
the
state
for
their
action
.
and
a
it
is
to
so
go
at
all
event
,
may
we
not
agree
that
the
sooner
the
better
?
it
is
not
claimed
that
the
election
ha
imposed
a
duty
on
member
to
change
their
view
or
their
vote
any
further
than
,
a
an
additional
element
to
be
considered
,
their
judgment
may
be
affected
by
it
.
it
is
the
voice
of
the
people
now
for
the
first
time
heard
upon
the
question
.
in
a
great
national
crisis
like
ours
unanimity
of
action
among
those
seeking
a
common
end
is
very
desirable
--
almost
indispensable
.
and
yet
no
approach
to
such
unanimity
is
attainable
unless
some
deference
shall
be
paid
to
the
will
of
the
majority
simply
because
it
is
the
will
of
the
majority
.
in
this
case
the
common
end
is
the
maintenance
of
the
union
,
and
among
the
mean
to
secure
that
end
such
will
,
through
the
election
,
is
most
dearly
declared
in
favor
of
such
constitutional
amendment
.
