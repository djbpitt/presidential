while
i
am
distinctly
in
favor
of
consistently
pursuing
the
policy
we
have
inaugurated
of
building
up
a
thorough
and
efficient
navy
,
i
can
not
refrain
from
the
suggestion
that
the
congress
should
carefully
take
into
account
the
number
of
unfinished
vessel
on
our
hand
and
the
depleted
condition
of
our
treasury
in
considering
the
propriety
of
an
appropriation
at
this
time
to
begin
new
work
.
