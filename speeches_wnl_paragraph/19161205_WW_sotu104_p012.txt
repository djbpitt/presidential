the
second
and
third
of
these
recommendation
the
congress
immediately
acted
on
:
it
established
the
eight-hour
day
a
the
legal
basis
of
work
and
wage
in
train
service
and
it
authorized
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
observe
and
report
upon
the
practical
result
,
deeming
these
the
measure
most
immediately
needed
;
but
it
postponed
action
upon
the
other
suggestion
until
an
opportunity
should
be
offered
for
a
more
deliberate
consideration
of
them
.
