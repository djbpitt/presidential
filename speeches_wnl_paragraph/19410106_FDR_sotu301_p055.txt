in
fulfillment
of
this
purpose
we
will
not
be
intimidated
by
the
threat
of
dictator
that
they
will
regard
a
a
breach
of
international
law
or
a
an
act
of
war
our
aid
to
the
democracy
which
dare
to
resist
their
aggression
.
such
aid
is
not
an
act
of
war
,
even
if
a
dictator
should
unilaterally
proclaim
it
so
to
be
.
