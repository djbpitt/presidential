now
,
even
with
better
high
school
,
most
young
people
will
need
some
higher
education
.
it
's
a
simple
fact
:
the
more
education
you
've
got
,
the
more
likely
you
are
to
have
a
good
job
and
work
your
way
into
the
middle
class
.
but
today
,
skyrocketing
cost
price
too
many
young
people
out
of
a
higher
education
or
saddle
them
with
unsustainable
debt
.
