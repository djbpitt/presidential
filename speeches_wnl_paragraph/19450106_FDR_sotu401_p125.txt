i
do
not
wish
to
give
the
impression
that
all
mistake
can
be
avoided
and
that
many
disappointment
are
not
inevitable
in
the
making
of
peace
.
but
we
must
not
this
time
lose
the
hope
of
establishing
an
international
order
which
will
be
capable
of
maintaining
peace
and
realizing
through
the
year
more
perfect
justice
between
nation
.
