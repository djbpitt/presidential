it
is
now
our
generation
's
task
to
carry
on
what
those
pioneer
began
.
for
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
our
wife
,
our
mother
and
daughter
can
earn
a
living
equal
to
their
effort
.
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
our
gay
brother
and
sister
are
treated
like
anyone
else
under
the
law—for
if
we
are
truly
created
equal
,
then
surely
the
love
we
commit
to
one
another
must
be
equal
a
well
.
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
no
citizen
is
forced
to
wait
for
hour
to
exercise
the
right
to
vote
.
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
we
find
a
better
way
to
welcome
the
striving
,
hopeful
immigrant
who
still
see
america
a
a
land
of
opportunity—until
bright
young
student
and
engineer
are
enlisted
in
our
workforce
rather
than
expelled
from
our
country
.
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
all
our
child
,
from
the
street
of
detroit
to
the
hill
of
appalachia
,
to
the
quiet
lane
of
newtown
,
know
that
they
are
cared
for
and
cherished
and
always
safe
from
harm
.
