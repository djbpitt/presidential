in
fact
,
much
of
our
new-found
energy
is
drawn
from
land
and
water
that
we
,
the
public
,
own
together
.
so
tonight
i
propose
we
use
some
of
our
oil
and
gas
revenue
to
fund
an
energy
security
trust
that
will
drive
new
research
and
technology
to
shift
our
car
and
truck
off
oil
for
good
.
if
a
nonpartisan
coalition
of
ceo
and
retired
general
and
admiral
can
get
behind
this
idea
,
then
so
can
we
.
let
's
take
their
advice
and
free
our
family
and
business
from
the
painful
spike
in
gas
price
we
've
put
up
with
for
far
too
long
.
