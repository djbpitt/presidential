now
,
let
me
repeat
:
we
cut
tax
.
we
cut
tax
for
95
percent
of
working
family
.
we
cut
tax
for
small
business
.
we
cut
tax
for
first-time
home
buyer
.
we
cut
tax
for
parent
trying
to
care
for
their
child
.
we
cut
tax
for
8
million
american
paying
for
college
.
i
thought
i
'd
get
some
applause
on
that
one
.
