a
revision
of
our
pension
law
could
easily
be
made
which
would
rest
upon
just
principle
and
provide
for
every
worthy
applicant
.
but
while
our
general
pension
law
remain
confused
and
imperfect
,
hundred
of
private
pension
law
are
annually
passed
,
which
are
the
source
of
unjust
discrimination
and
popular
demoralization
.
