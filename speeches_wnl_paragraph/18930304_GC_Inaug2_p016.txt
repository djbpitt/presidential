it
is
a
plain
dictate
of
honesty
and
good
government
that
public
expendituresshould
be
limited
by
public
necessity
,
and
that
this
should
be
measuredby
the
rule
of
strict
economy
;
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
frugalityamong
the
people
is
the
best
guaranty
of
a
contented
and
strong

free
institution
