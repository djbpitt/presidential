but
when
i
ran
for
president
,
i
promised
i
would
n't
just
do
what
wa
popular
;
i
would
do
what
wa
necessary
.
and
if
we
had
allowed
the
meltdown
of
the
financial
system
,
unemployment
might
be
double
what
it
is
today
.
more
business
would
certainly
have
closed
.
more
home
would
have
surely
been
lost
.
