the
interest
of
labor
are
certainly
,
though
indirectly
,
involved
in
this
feature
of
our
tariff
system
.
the
sharp
competition
and
active
struggle
among
our
manufacturer
to
supply
the
limited
demand
for
their
good
soon
fill
the
narrow
market
to
which
they
are
confined
.
then
follows
a
suspension
of
work
in
mill
and
factory
,
a
discharge
of
employee
,
and
distress
in
the
home
of
our
workingman
.
