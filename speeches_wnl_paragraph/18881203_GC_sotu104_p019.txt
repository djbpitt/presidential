our
workingman
,
enfranchised
from
all
delusion
and
no
longer
frightened
by
the
cry
that
their
wage
are
endangered
by
a
just
revision
of
our
tariff
law
,
will
reasonably
demand
through
such
revision
steadier
employment
,
cheaper
mean
of
living
in
their
home
,
freedom
for
themselves
and
their
child
from
the
doom
of
perpetual
servitude
,
and
an
open
door
to
their
advancement
beyond
the
limit
of
a
laboring
class
.
others
of
our
citizen
,
whose
comfort
and
expenditure
are
measured
by
moderate
salary
and
fixed
income
,
will
insist
upon
the
fairness
and
justice
of
cheapening
the
cost
of
necessary
for
themselves
and
their
family
