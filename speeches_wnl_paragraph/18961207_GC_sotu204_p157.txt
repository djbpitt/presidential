this
plan
of
issuing
bond
for
the
purpose
of
redemption
certainly
appears
to
be
the
most
effective
and
direct
path
to
the
needed
reform
.
in
default
of
this
,
however
,
it
would
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
if
currency
obligation
redeemable
in
gold
whenever
so
redeemed
should
be
canceled
instead
of
being
reissued
.
this
operation
would
be
a
slow
remedy
,
but
it
would
improve
present
condition
.
