now
,
yesterday
the
senate
blocked
a
bill
that
would
have
created
this
commission
,
so
i'll
issue
an
executive
order
that
will
allow
u
to
go
forward
,
because
i
refuse
to
pas
this
problem
on
to
another
generation
of
american
.
and
when
the
vote
come
tomorrow
,
the
senate
should
restore
the
pay-as-you-go
law
that
wa
a
big
reason
for
why
we
had
record
surplus
in
the
1990s
.
