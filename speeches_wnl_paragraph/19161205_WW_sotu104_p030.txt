the
argument
for
the
proposed
amendment
of
the
organic
law
of
porto
rico
is
brief
and
conclusive
.
the
present
law
governing
the
island
and
regulating
the
right
and
privilege
of
it
people
are
not
just
.
we
have
created
expectation
of
extended
privilege
which
we
have
not
satisfied
.
there
is
uneasiness
among
the
people
of
the
island
and
even
a
suspicious
doubt
with
regard
to
our
intention
concerning
them
which
the
adoption
of
the
pending
measure
would
happily
remove
.
we
do
not
doubt
what
we
wish
to
do
in
any
essential
particular
.
we
ought
to
do
it
at
once
.
