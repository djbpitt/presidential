that
is
our
generation
's
taskâ€”to
make
these
word
,
these
right
,
these
value
of
life
and
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
real
for
every
american
.
being
true
to
our
founding
document
doe
not
require
u
to
agree
on
every
contour
of
life
.
it
doe
not
mean
we
all
define
liberty
in
exactly
the
same
way
or
follow
the
same
precise
path
to
happiness
.
progress
doe
not
compel
u
to
settle
centuries-long
debate
about
the
role
of
government
for
all
time
,
but
it
doe
require
u
to
act
in
our
time
.
