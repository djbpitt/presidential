i
have
asked
this
bipartisan
commission
to
review
our
proposal
for
federal
action
to
cope
with
the
gathering
crisis
of
school
finance
and
property
tax
.
later
in
the
year
,
when
both
commission
have
completed
their
study
,
i
shall
make
my
final
recommendation
for
relieving
the
burden
of
property
tax
and
providing
both
fair
and
adequate
financing
for
our
child
's
education
.
