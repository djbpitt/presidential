it
is
in
this
spirit
and
with
this
thought
that
we
have
grown
more
andmore
aware
,
more
and
more
certain
that
the
part
we
wished
to
play
wa
thepart
of
those
who
mean
to
vindicate
and
fortify
peace
.
we
have
been
obligedto
arm
ourselves
to
make
good
our
claim
to
a
certain
minimum
of
right
andof
freedom
of
action
.
we
stand
firm
in
armed
neutrality
since
it
seemsthat
in
no
other
way
we
can
demonstrate
what
it
is
we
insist
upon
and
cannotforget
.
we
may
even
be
drawn
on
,
by
circumstance
,
not
by
our
own
purposeor
desire
,
to
a
more
active
assertion
of
our
right
a
we
see
them
anda
more
immediate
association
with
the
great
struggle
itself
.
but
nothingwill
alter
our
thought
or
our
purpose
.
they
are
too
clear
to
be
obscured.they
are
too
deeply
rooted
in
the
principle
of
our
national
life
to
bealtered
.
we
desire
neither
conquest
nor
advantage
.
we
wish
nothing
thatcan
be
had
only
at
the
cost
of
another
people
.
we
always
professed
unselfishpurpose
and
we
covet
the
opportunity
to
prove
our
profession
are
sincere
.
