of
thousand
of
talented
,
hard-working
student

this
country
face
another
challenge
:
the
fact
that
they
are
n't
yet
american
citizen
.
many
were
brought
here
a
small
child
,
are
american
through
and
through
,
yet
they
live
every
day
with
the
threat
of
deportation
.
others
came
more
recently
,
to
study
business
and
science
and
engineering
,
but
a
soon
a
they
get
their
degree
,
we
send
them
home
to
invent
new
product
and
create
new
job
somewhere
else
.
