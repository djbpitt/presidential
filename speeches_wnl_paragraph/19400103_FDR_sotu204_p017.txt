i
ask
that
all
of
u
everywhere
think
thing
through
with
the
single
aim
of
how
best
to
serve
the
future
of
our
own
nation
.
i
do
not
mean
merely
it
future
relationship
with
the
outside
world
.
i
mean
it
domestic
future
a
well—the
work
,
the
security
,
the
prosperity
,
the
happiness
,
the
life
of
all
the
boy
and
girl
in
the
united
state
,
a
they
are
inevitably
affected
by
such
world
relationship
.
for
it
becomes
clearer
and
clearer
that
the
future
world
will
be
a
shabby
and
dangerous
place
to
live
in-yes
,
even
for
american
to
live
in—if
it
is
ruled
by
force
in
the
hand
of
a
few
.
