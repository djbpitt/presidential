it
is
not
needed
nor
fitting
here
that
a
general
argument
should
be
made
in
favor
of
popular
institution
,
but
there
is
one
point
,
with
it
connection
,
not
so
hackneyed
a
most
others
,
to
which
i
ask
a
brief
attention
.
it
is
the
effort
to
place
capital
on
an
equal
footing
with
,
if
not
above
,
labor
in
the
structure
of
government
.
it
is
assumed
that
labor
is
available
only
in
connection
with
capital
;
that
nobody
labor
unless
somebody
else
,
owning
capital
,
somehow
by
the
use
of
it
induces
him
to
labor
.
this
assumed
,
it
is
next
considered
whether
it
is
best
that
capital
shall
hire
laborer
,
and
thus
induce
them
to
work
by
their
own
consent
,
or
buy
them
and
drive
them
to
it
without
their
consent
.
having
proceeded
so
far
,
it
is
naturally
concluded
that
all
laborer
are
either
hired
laborer
or
what
we
call
slave
.
and
further
,
it
is
assumed
that
whoever
is
once
a
hired
laborer
is
fixed
in
that
condition
for
life
.
