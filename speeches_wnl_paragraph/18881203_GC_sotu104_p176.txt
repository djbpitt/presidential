i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
our
general
pension
law
should
be
revised
and
adjusted
to
meet
a
far
a
possible
,
in
the
light
of
our
experience
,
all
meritorious
case
.
the
fact
that
102
different
rate
of
pension
are
paid
can
not
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
made
consistent
with
justice
to
the
pensioner
or
to
the
government
;
and
the
numerous
private
pension
bill
that
are
passed
,
predicated
upon
the
imperfection
of
general
law
,
while
they
increase
in
many
case
existing
inequality
and
injustice
,
lend
additional
force
to
the
recommendation
for
a
revision
of
the
general
law
on
this
subject
.
