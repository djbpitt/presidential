this
reference
to
the
condition
and
prospect
of
our
revenue
naturally
suggests
an
allusion
to
the
weakness
and
vice
of
our
financial
method
.
they
have
been
frequently
pressed
upon
the
attention
of
congress
in
previous
executive
communication
and
the
inevitable
danger
of
their
continued
toleration
pointed
out
.
without
now
repeating
these
detail
,
i
can
not
refrain
from
again
earnestly
presenting
the
necessity
of
the
prompt
reform
of
a
system
opposed
to
every
rule
of
sound
finance
and
shown
by
experience
to
be
fraught
with
the
gravest
peril
and
perplexity
.
the
terrible
civil
war
,
which
shook
the
foundation
of
our
government
more
than
thirty
year
ago
,
brought
in
it
train
the
destruction
of
property
,
the
wasting
of
our
country
's
substance
,
and
the
estrangement
of
brother
.
these
are
now
past
and
forgotten
.
even
the
distressing
loss
of
life
the
conflict
entailed
is
but
a
sacred
memory
which
foster
patriotic
sentiment
and
keep
alive
a
tender
regard
for
those
who
nobly
died
.
and
yet
there
remains
with
u
to-day
in
full
strength
and
activity
,
a
an
incident
of
that
tremendous
struggle
,
a
feature
of
it
financial
necessity
not
only
unsuited
to
our
present
circumstance
,
but
manifestly
a
disturbing
menace
to
business
security
and
an
ever-present
agent
of
monetary
distress
.
