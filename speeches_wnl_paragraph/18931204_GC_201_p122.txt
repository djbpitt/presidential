i
am
unable
to
understand
why
fraud
in
the
pension
roll
should
not
be
exposed
and
corrected
with
thoroughness
and
vigor
.
every
name
fraudulently
put
upon
these
roll
is
a
wicked
imposition
upon
the
kindly
sentiment
in
which
pension
have
their
origin
;
every
fraudulent
pensioner
ha
become
a
bad
citizen
;
every
false
oath
in
support
of
a
pension
ha
made
perjury
more
common
,
and
false
and
undeserving
pensioner
rob
the
people
not
only
of
their
money
,
but
of
the
patriotic
sentiment
which
the
survivor
of
a
war
fought
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
ought
to
inspire
.
thousand
of
neighborhood
have
their
well-known
fraudulent
pensioner
,
and
recent
development
by
the
bureau
establish
appalling
conspiracy
to
accomplish
pension
fraud
.
by
no
mean
the
least
wrong
done
is
to
brave
and
deserving
pensioner
,
who
certainly
ought
not
to
be
condemned
to
such
association
.
