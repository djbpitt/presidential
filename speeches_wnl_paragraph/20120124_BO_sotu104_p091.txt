how
this
incredible
transformation
will
end
remains
uncertain
.
but
we
have
a
huge
stake
in
the
outcome
.
and
while
it
's
ultimately
up
to
the
people
of
the
region
to
decide
their
fate
,
we
will
advocate
for
those
value
that
have
served
our
own
country
so
well
.
we
will
stand
against
violence
and
intimidation
.
we
will
stand
for
the
right
and
dignity
of
all
human
being
:
men
and
woman
;
christian
,
muslim
,
and
jew
.
we
will
support
policy
that
lead
to
strong
and
stable
democracy
and
open
market
,
because
tyranny
is
no
match
for
liberty
.
