the
reorganization
of
the
consular
service
is
a
matter
of
serious
importance
to
our
national
interest
.
the
number
of
existing
principal
consular
office
is
believed
to
be
greater
than
is
at
all
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
the
public
business
.
it
need
not
be
our
policy
to
maintain
more
than
a
moderate
number
of
principal
office
,
each
supported
by
a
salary
sufficient
to
enable
the
incumbent
to
live
in
comfort
,
and
so
distributed
a
to
secure
the
convenient
supervision
,
through
subordinate
agency
,
of
affair
over
a
considerable
district
.
