a
number
of
armenian
refugee
having
arrived
at
our
port
,
an
order
ha
lately
been
obtained
from
the
turkish
government
permitting
the
wife
and
child
of
such
refugee
to
join
them
here
.
it
is
hoped
that
hereafter
no
obstacle
will
be
interposed
to
prevent
the
escape
of
all
those
who
seek
to
avoid
the
peril
which
threaten
them
in
turkish
dominion
.
