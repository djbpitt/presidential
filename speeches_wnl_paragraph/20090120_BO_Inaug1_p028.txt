our
challenge
may
be
new
.
the
instrument
with
which
we
meet
them
may
be
new
.
but
those
value
upon
which
our
success
depends—hard
work
and
honesty
,
courage
and
fair
play
,
tolerance
and
curiosity
,
loyalty
and
patriotism—these
thing
are
old
.
these
thing
are
true
.
they
have
been
the
quiet
force
of
progress
throughout
our
history
.
what
is
demanded
then
is
a
return
to
these
truth
.
what
is
required
of
u
now
is
a
new
era
of
responsibility—a
recognition
,
on
the
part
of
every
american
,
that
we
have
duty
to
ourselves
,
our
nation
,
and
the
world
,
duty
that
we
do
not
grudgingly
accept
but
rather
seize
gladly
,
firm
in
the
knowledge
that
there
is
nothing
so
satisfying
to
the
spirit
,
so
defining
of
our
character
,
than
giving
our
all
to
a
difficult
task
.
