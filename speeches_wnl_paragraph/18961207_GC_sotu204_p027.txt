when
the
inability
of
spain
to
deal
successfully
with
the
insurrection
ha
become
manifest
and
it
is
demonstrated
that
her
sovereignty
is
extinct
in
cuba
for
all
purpose
of
it
rightful
existence
,
and
when
a
hopeless
struggle
for
it
reestablishment
ha
degenerated
into
a
strife
which
mean
nothing
more
than
the
useless
sacrifice
of
human
life
and
the
utter
destruction
of
the
very
subject-matter
of
the
conflict
,
a
situation
will
be
presented
in
which
our
obligation
to
the
sovereignty
of
spain
will
be
superseded
by
higher
obligation
,
which
we
can
hardly
hesitate
to
recognize
and
discharge
.
deferring
the
choice
of
way
and
method
until
the
time
for
action
arrives
,
we
should
make
them
depend
upon
the
precise
condition
then
existing
;
and
they
should
not
be
determined
upon
without
giving
careful
heed
to
every
consideration
involving
our
honor
and
interest
or
the
international
duty
we
owe
to
spain
.
until
we
face
the
contingency
suggested
or
the
situation
is
by
other
incident
imperatively
changed
we
should
continue
in
the
line
of
conduct
heretofore
pursued
,
thus
in
all
circumstance
exhibiting
our
obedience
to
the
requirement
of
public
law
and
our
regard
for
the
duty
enjoined
upon
u
by
the
position
we
occupy
in
the
family
of
nation
.
