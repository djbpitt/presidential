the
department
of
agriculture
is
so
intimately
related
to
the
welfare
of
our
people
and
the
prosperity
of
our
nation
that
it
should
constantly
receive
the
care
and
encouragement
of
the
government
.
from
small
beginning
it
ha
grown
to
be
the
center
of
agricultural
intelligence
and
the
source
of
aid
and
encouragement
to
agricultural
effort
.
large
sum
of
money
are
annually
appropriated
for
the
maintenance
of
this
department
,
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
legislation
relating
to
it
ha
not
always
been
directly
in
the
interest
of
practical
farming
or
properly
guarded
against
waste
and
extravagance
.
so
far
,
however
,
a
public
money
ha
been
appropriated
fairly
and
sensibly
to
help
those
who
actually
till
the
soil
,
no
expenditure
ha
been
more
profitably
made
or
more
generally
approved
by
the
people
.
