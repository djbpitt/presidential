in
like
manner
,
a
several
of
the
court
have
doubted
,
under
particular
circumstance
,
their
power
to
liberate
the
vessel
of
a
nation
at
peace
,
and
even
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
state
,
although
seized
under
a
false
color
of
being
hostile
property
,
and
have
denied
their
power
to
liberate
certain
capture
within
the
protection
of
our
territory
,
it
would
seem
proper
to
regulate
their
jurisdiction
in
these
point
.
but
if
the
executive
is
to
be
the
resort
in
either
of
the
two
last-mentioned
case
,
it
is
hoped
that
he
will
be
authorized
by
law
to
have
fact
ascertained
by
the
court
when
for
his
own
information
he
shall
request
it
.
