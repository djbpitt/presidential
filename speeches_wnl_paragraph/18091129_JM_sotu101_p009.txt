some
of
the

although
professing
just
and
amicable
disposition

injury
materially
affecting

the
interposition
deemed
proper

it
well
deserves
the
consideration

how

both
the
safety

the
honor
of

may
be
consulted
,
by
adequate
provision
against
that
collusive
prostitution
of
it
by
individual
unworthy

the
american

which
ha
so
