from
this
position
of
strength
,
we
've
begun
to
wind
down
the
war
in
afghanistan
.
ten
thousand
of
our
troop
have
come
home
.
twenty-three
thousand
more
will
leave
by
the
end
of
this
summer
.
this
transition
to
afghan
lead
will
continue
,
and
we
will
build
an
enduring
partnership
with
afghanistan
so
that
it
is
never
again
a
source
of
attack
against
america
.
