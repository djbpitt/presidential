at
this
second
appearing
to
take
the
oath
of
the
presidential
office
there
is
le
occasion
for
an
extended
address
than
there
wa
at
the
first
.
then
a
statement
somewhat
in
detail
of
a
course
to
be
pursued
seemed
fitting
and
proper
.
now
,
at
the
expiration
of
four
year
,
during
which
public
declaration
have
been
constantly
called
forth
on
every
point
and
phase
of
the
great
contest
which
still
absorbs
the
attention
and
engrosses
the
energy
of
the
nation
,
little
that
is
new
could
be
presented
.
the
progress
of
our
arm
,
upon
which
all
else
chiefly
depends
,
is
a
well
known
to
the
public
a
to
myself
,
and
it
is
,
i
trust
,
reasonably
satisfactory
and
encouraging
to
all
.
with
high
hope
for
the
future
,
no
prediction
in
regard
to
it
is
ventured
.
