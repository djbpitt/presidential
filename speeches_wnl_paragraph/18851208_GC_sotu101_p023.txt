the
lapse
of
year
ha
abundantly
confirmed
the
wisdom
and
foresight
of
those
earlier
administration
which
,
long
before
the
condition
of
maritime
intercourse
were
changed
and
enlarged
by
the
progress
of
the
age
,
proclaimed
the
vital
need
of
interoceanic
transit
across
the
american
isthmus
and
consecrated
it
in
advance
to
the
common
use
of
mankind
by
their
positive
declaration
and
through
the
formal
obligation
of
treaty
.
toward
such
realization
the
effort
of
my
administration
will
be
applied
,
ever
bearing
in
mind
the
principle
on
which
it
must
rest
,
and
which
were
declared
in
no
uncertain
tone
by
mr.
ca
,
who
,
while
secretary
of
state
,
in
1858
,
announced
that
``
what
the
united
state
want
in
central
america
,
next
to
the
happiness
of
it
people
,
is
the
security
and
neutrality
of
the
interoceanic
route
which
lead
through
it
.
