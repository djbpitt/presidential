it
is
a
precious
reflection
that
the
transition
from
this
prosperous
condition
of
our
country
to
the
scene
which
ha
for
some
time
been
distressing
u
is
not
chargeable
on
any
unwarrantable
view
,
nor
,
a
i
trust
,
on
any
involuntary
error
in
the
public
council
.
indulging
no
passion
which
trespass
on
the
right
or
the
repose
of
other
nation
,
it
ha
been
the
true
glory
of
the
united
state
to
cultivate
peace
by
observing
justice
,
and
to
entitle
themselves
to
the
respect
of
the
nation
at
war
by
fulfilling
their
neutral
obligation
with
the
most
scrupulous
impartiality
.
if
there
be
candor
in
the
world
,
the
truth
of
these
assertion
will
not
be
questioned
;
posterity
at
least
will
do
justice
to
them
.
