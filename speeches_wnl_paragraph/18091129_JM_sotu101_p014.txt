the
sum
which
had
been
previously
accumulated
in
the
treasury
,
together
with
the
receipt
during
the
year
ending
on
the
30th
of
september
last
(
and
amounting
to
more
than
$
9m
)
,
have
enabled
u
to
fulfill
all
our
engagement
and
to
defray
the
current
expense
of
government
without
recurring
to
any
loan
.
but
the
insecurity
of
our
commerce
and
the
consequent
diminution
of
the
public
revenue
will
probably
produce
a
deficiency
in
the
receipt
of
the
ensuing
year
,
for
which
and
for
other
detail
i
refer
to
the
statement
which
will
be
transmitted
from
the
treasury
.
