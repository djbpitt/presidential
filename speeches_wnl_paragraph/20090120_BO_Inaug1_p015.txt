this
is
the
journey
we
continue
today
.
we
remain
the
most
prosperous
,
powerful
nation
on
earth
.
our
worker
are
no
le
productive
than
when
this
crisis
began
.
our
mind
are
no
le
inventive
,
our
good
and
service
no
le
needed
than
they
were
last
week
or
last
month
or
last
year
.
our
capacity
remains
undiminished
.
but
our
time
of
standing
pat
,
of
protecting
narrow
interest
and
putting
off
unpleasant
decisionsâ€”that
time
ha
surely
passed
.
starting
today
,
we
must
pick
ourselves
up
,
dust
ourselves
off
,
and
begin
again
the
work
of
remaking
america
.
