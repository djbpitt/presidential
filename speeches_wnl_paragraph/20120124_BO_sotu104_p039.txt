recently
,
i
spoke
with
a
group
of
college
president
who
have
done
just
that
.
some
school
redesign
course
to
help
student
finish
more
quickly
.
some
use
better
technology
.
the
point
is
,
it
's
possible
.
so
let
me
put
college
and
university
on
notice
:
if
you
ca
n't
stop
tuition
from
going
up
,
the
funding
you
get
from
taxpayer
will
go
down
.
higher
education
ca
n't
be
a
luxury
.
it
is
an
economic
imperative
that
every
family
in
america
should
be
able
to
afford
.
