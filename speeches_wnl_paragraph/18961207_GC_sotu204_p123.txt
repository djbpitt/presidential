in
my
opinion
,
based
upon
such
statement
a
these
and
much
other
information
and
observation
,
the
abuse
which
have
been
allowed
to
creep
into
our
pension
system
have
done
incalculable
harm
in
demoralizing
our
people
and
undermining
good
citizenship
.
i
have
endeavored
within
my
sphere
of
official
duty
to
protect
our
pension
roll
and
make
it
what
it
should
be
,
a
roll
of
honor
,
containing
the
name
of
those
disabled
in
their
country
's
service
and
worthy
of
their
country
's
affectionate
remembrance
.
when
i
have
seen
those
who
pose
a
the
soldier
'
friend
active
and
alert
in
urging
greater
laxity
and
more
reckless
pension
expenditure
,
while
nursing
selfish
scheme
,
i
have
deprecated
the
approach
of
a
situation
when
necessary
retrenchment
and
enforced
economy
may
lead
to
an
attack
upon
pension
abuse
so
determined
a
to
overlook
the
discrimination
due
to
those
who
,
worthy
of
a
nation
's
care
,
ought
to
live
and
die
under
the
protection
of
a
nation
's
gratitude
.
