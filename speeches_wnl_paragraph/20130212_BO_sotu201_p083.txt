of
course
,
what
i
've
said
tonight
matter
little
if
we
do
n't
come
together
to
protect
our
most
precious
resource
:
our
child
.
it
ha
been
2
month
since
newtown
.
i
know
this
is
not
the
first
time
this
country
ha
debated
how
to
reduce
gun
violence
.
but
this
time
is
different
.
overwhelming
majority
of
americans—americans
who
believe
in
the
second
amendment—have
come
together
around
commonsense
reform
,
like
background
check
that
will
make
it
harder
for
criminal
to
get
their
hand
on
a
gun
.
senator
of
both
party
are
working
together
on
tough
new
law
to
prevent
anyone
from
buying
gun
for
resale
to
criminal
.
police
chief
are
asking
our
help
to
get
weapon
of
war
and
massive
ammunition
magazine
off
our
street
,
because
these
police
chief
,
they
're
tired
of
seeing
their
guy
and
gal
being
outgunned
.
