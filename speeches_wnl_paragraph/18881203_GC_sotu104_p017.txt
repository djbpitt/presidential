the
arrogance
of
this
assumption
is
unconcealed
.
it
appears
in
the
sordid
disregard
of
all
but
personal
interest
,
in
the
refusal
to
abate
for
the
benefit
of
others
one
iota
of
selfish
advantage
,
and
in
combination
to
perpetuate
such
advantage
through
effort
to
control
legislation
and
improperly
influence
the
suffrage
of
the
people
.
