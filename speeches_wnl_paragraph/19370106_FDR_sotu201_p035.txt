in
a
world
unhappily
thinking
in
term
of
war
,
the
representative
of
twenty-one
nation
sat
around
a
table
,
in
an
atmosphere
of
complete
confidence
and
understanding
,
sincerely
discussing
measure
for
maintaining
peace
.
here
wa
a
great
and
a
permanent
achievement
directly
affecting
the
life
and
security
of
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
human
being
who
dwell
in
this
western
hemisphere
.
here
wa
an
example
which
must
have
a
wholesome
effect
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
.
