and
that
ha
to
start
at
the
earliest
possible
age
.
study
after
study
show
that
the
sooner
a
child
begin
learning
,
the
better
he
or
she
doe
down
the
road
.
but
today
,
fewer
than
3
in
10
4-year-olds
are
enrolled
in
a
high-quality
preschool
program
.
most
middle
class
parent
ca
n't
afford
a
few
hundred
buck
a
week
for
a
private
preschool
.
and
for
poor
kid
who
need
help
the
most
,
this
lack
of
access
to
preschool
education
can
shadow
them
for
the
rest
of
their
life
.
so
tonight
i
propose
working
with
state
to
make
high-quality
preschool
available
to
every
single
child
in
america
.
that
's
something
we
should
be
able
to
do
.
