i
take
the
official
oath
to-day
with
no
mental
reservation
,
and
with
no
purpose
to
construe
the
constitution
or
law
by
any
hypercritical
rule
.
and
while
i
do
not
choose
now
to
specify
particular
act
of
congress
a
proper
to
be
enforced
,
i
do
suggest
that
it
will
be
much
safer
for
all
,
both
in
official
and
private
station
,
to
conform
to
and
abide
by
all
those
act
which
stand
unrepealed
,
than
to
violate
any
of
them
,
trusting
to
find
impunity
in
having
them
held
to
be
unconstitutional
.
