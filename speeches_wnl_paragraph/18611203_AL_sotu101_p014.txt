i
invite
your
attention
to
the
correspondence
between
her
britannic
majesty
's
minister
accredited
to
this
government
and
the
secretary
of
state
relative
to
the
detention
of
the
british
ship
perthshire
in
june
last
by
the
united
state
steamer
massachusetts
for
a
supposed
breach
of
the
blockade
.
a
this
detention
wa
occasioned
by
an
obvious
misapprehension
of
the
fact
,
and
a
justice
requires
that
we
should
commit
no
belligerent
act
not
rounded
in
strict
right
a
sanctioned
by
public
law
,
i
recommend
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
satisfy
the
reasonable
demand
of
the
owner
of
the
vessel
for
her
detention
.
