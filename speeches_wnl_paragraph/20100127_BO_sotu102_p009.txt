so
we
face
big
and
difficult
challenge
.
and
what
the
american
people
hope
,
what
they
deserve
,
is
for
all
of
u
,
democrat
and
republican
,
to
work
through
our
difference
,
to
overcome
the
numbing
weight
of
our
politics
.
for
while
the
people
who
sent
u
here
have
different
background
,
different
story
,
different
belief
,
the
anxiety
they
face
are
the
same
.
the
aspiration
they
hold
are
shared
:
a
job
that
pay
the
bill
;
a
chance
to
get
ahead
;
most
of
all
,
the
ability
to
give
their
child
a
better
life
.
