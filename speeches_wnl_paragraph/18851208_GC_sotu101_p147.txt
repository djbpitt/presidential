we
have
now
on
hand
all
the
silver
dollar
necessary
to
supply
the
present
need
of
the
people
and
to
satisfy
those
who
from
sentiment
wish
to
see
them
in
circulation
,
and
if
their
coinage
is
suspended
they
can
be
readily
obtained
by
all
who
desire
them
.
if
the
need
of
more
is
at
anytime
apparent
,
their
coinage
may
be
renewed
.
