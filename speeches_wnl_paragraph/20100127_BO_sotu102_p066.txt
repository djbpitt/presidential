with
all
due
deference
to
separation
of
power
,
last
week
,
the
supreme
court
reversed
a
century
of
law
that
i
believe
will
open
the
floodgate
for
special
interest
,
including
foreign
corporation
,
to
spend
without
limit
in
our
election
.
i
do
n't
think
american
election
should
be
bankrolled
by
america
's
most
powerful
interest
,
or
worse
,
by
foreign
entity
.
they
should
be
decided
by
the
american
people
.
and
i
'd
urge
democrat
and
republican
to
pas
a
bill
that
help
correct
some
of
these
problem
.
