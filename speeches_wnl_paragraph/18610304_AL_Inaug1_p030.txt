one
section
of
our
country
belief
slavery
is
right
,
and
ought
to
be
extended
,
while
the
other
belief
it
is
wrong
,
and
ought
not
to
be
extended
.
this
is
the
only
substantial
dispute
.
the
fugitive-slave
clause
of
the
constitution
,
and
the
law
for
the
suppression
of
the
foreign
slave-trade
,
are
each
a
well
enforced
,
perhaps
,
a
any
law
can
ever
be
in
a
community
where
the
moral
sense
of
the
people
imperfectly
support
the
law
itself
.
the
great
body
of
the
people
abide
by
the
dry
legal
obligation
in
both
case
,
and
a
few
break
over
in
each
.
this
,
i
think
,
can
not
be
perfectly
cured
;
and
it
would
be
worse
in
both
case
after
the
separation
of
the
section
than
before
.
the
foreign
slave-trade
,
now
imperfectly
suppressed
,
would
be
ultimately
revived
,
without
restriction
,
in
one
section
,
while
fugitive
slave
,
now
only
partially
surrendered
,
would
not
be
surrendered
at
all
by
the
other
.
