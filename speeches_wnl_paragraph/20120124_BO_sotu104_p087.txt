the
point
is
,
we
should
all
want
a
smarter
,
more
effective
government
.
and
while
we
may
not
be
able
to
bridge
our
biggest
philosophical
difference
this
year
,
we
can
make
real
progress
.
with
or
without
this
congress
,
i
will
keep
taking
action
that
help
the
economy
grow
.
but
i
can
do
a
whole
lot
more
with
your
help
.
because
when
we
act
together
,
there
's
nothing
the
united
state
of
america
ca
n't
achieve
.
