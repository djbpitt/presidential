i
desire
to
repeat
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
last
annual
message
in
favor
of
providing
at
public
expense
official
residence
for
our
ambassador
and
minister
at
foreign
capital
.
the
reason
supporting
this
recommendation
are
strongly
stated
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
,
and
the
subject
seems
of
such
importance
that
i
hope
it
may
receive
the
early
attention
of
the
congress
.
