to
give
to
our
vessel
of
war
,
public
and
private
,
the
requisite
advantage
in
their
cruise
,
it
is
of
much
importance
that
they
should
have
,
both
for
themselves
and
their
prize
,
the
use
of
the
port
and
market
of
friendly
power
.
with
this
view
,
i
recommend
to
congress
the
expediency
of
such
legal
provision
a
may
supply
the
defect
or
remove
the
doubt
of
the
executive
authority
,
to
allow
to
the
cruiser
of
other
power
at
war
with
enemy
of
the
united
state
such
use
of
the
american
port
a
may
correspond
with
the
privilege
allowed
by
such
power
to
american
cruiser
.
