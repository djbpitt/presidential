observation
on
the
value
of
peace
with
other
nation
are
unnecessary
.
it
would
be
wise
,
however
,
by
timely
provision
to
guard
against
those
act
of
our
own
citizen
which
might
tend
to
disturb
it
,
and
to
put
ourselves
in
a
condition
to
give
that
satisfaction
to
foreign
nation
which
we
may
sometimes
have
occasion
to
require
from
them
.
i
particularly
recommend
to
your
consideration
the
mean
of
preventing
those
aggression
by
our
citizen
on
the
territory
of
other
nation
,
and
other
infraction
of
the
law
of
nation
,
which
,
furnishing
just
subject
of
complaint
,
might
endanger
our
peace
with
them
;
and
,
in
general
,
the
maintenance
of
a
friendly
intercourse
with
foreign
power
will
be
presented
to
your
attention
by
the
expiration
of
the
law
for
that
purpose
,
which
take
place
,
if
not
renewed
,
at
the
close
of
the
present
session
.
