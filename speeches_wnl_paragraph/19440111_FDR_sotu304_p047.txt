``
when
the
very
life
of
the
nation
is
in
peril
the
responsibility
for
service
is
common
to
all
men
and
woman
.
in
such
a
time
there
can
be
no
discrimination
between
the
men
and
woman
who
are
assigned
by
the
government
to
it
defense
at
the
battlefront
and
the
men
and
woman
assigned
to
producing
the
vital
material
essential
to
successful
military
operation
.
a
prompt
enactment
of
a
national
service
law
would
be
merely
an
expression
of
the
universality
of
this
responsibility
.
