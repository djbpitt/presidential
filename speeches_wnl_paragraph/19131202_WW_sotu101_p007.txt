i
turn
to
matter
of
domestic
concern
.
you
already
have
under
consideration
a
bill
for
the
reform
of
our
system
of
banking
and
currency
,
for
which
the
country
wait
with
impatience
,
a
for
something
fundamental
to
it
whole
business
life
and
necessary
to
set
credit
free
from
arbitrary
and
artificial
restraint
.
i
need
not
say
how
earnestly
i
hope
for
it
early
enactment
into
law
.
i
take
leave
to
beg
that
the
whole
energy
and
attention
of
the
senate
be
concentrated
upon
it
till
the
matter
is
successfully
disposed
of
.
and
yet
i
feel
that
the
request
is
not
needed-that
the
member
of
that
great
house
need
no
urging
in
this
service
to
the
country
.
