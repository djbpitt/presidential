in
directing
the
legislative
attention
to
the
state
of
the
finance
it
is
a
subject
of
great
gratification
to
find
that
even
within
the
short
period
which
ha
elapsed
since
the
return
of
peace
the
revenue
ha
far
exceeded
all
the
current
demand
upon
the
treasury
,
and
that
under
any
probable
diminution
of
it
future
annual
product
which
the
vicissitude
of
commerce
may
occasion
it
will
afford
an
ample
fund
for
the
effectual
and
early
extinguishment
of
the
public
debt
.
it
ha
been
estimated
that
during
the
year
1816
the
actual
receipt
of
revenue
at
the
treasury
,
including
the
balance
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
,
and
excluding
the
proceeds
of
loan
and
treasury
note
,
will
amount
to
about
the
sum
of
$
47,000,000
;
that
during
the
same
year
the
actual
payment
at
the
treasury
,
including
the
payment
of
the
arrearages
of
the
war
department
a
well
a
the
payment
of
a
considerable
excess
beyond
the
annual
appropriation
,
will
amount
to
about
the
sum
of
$
38m
,
and
that
consequently
at
the
close
of
the
year
there
will
be
a
surplus
in
the
treasury
of
about
the
sum
of
$
9m
.
