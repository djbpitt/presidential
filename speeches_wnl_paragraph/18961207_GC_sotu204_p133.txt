the
large
and
increasing
exportation
of
our
agricultural
product
suggests
the
great
usefulness
of
the
organization
lately
established
in
the
department
for
the
purpose
of
giving
to
those
engaged
in
farming
pursuit
reliable
information
concerning
the
condition
,
need
,
and
advantage
of
different
foreign
market
.
inasmuch
a
the
success
of
the
farmer
depends
upon
the
advantageous
sale
of
his
product
,
and
inasmuch
a
foreign
market
must
largely
be
the
destination
of
such
product
,
it
is
quite
apparent
that
a
knowledge
of
the
condition
and
want
that
affect
those
market
ought
to
result
in
sowing
more
intelligently
and
reaping
with
a
better
promise
of
profit
.
such
information
point
out
the
way
to
a
prudent
foresight
in
the
selection
and
cultivation
of
crop
and
to
a
release
from
the
bondage
of
unreasoning
monotony
of
production
,
a
glutted
and
depressed
market
,
and
constantly
recurring
unprofitable
toil
.
