it
wa
decided
,
with
my
approbation
,
after
a
sufficient
examination
,
to
be
inexpedient
for
the
post-office
department
to
contract
for
carrying
our
foreign
mail
under
the
additional
authority
given
by
the
last
congress
.
the
amount
limited
wa
inadequate
to
pay
all
within
the
purview
of
the
law
the
full
rate
of
50
cent
per
mile
,
and
it
would
have
been
unjust
and
unwise
to
have
given
it
to
some
and
denied
it
to
others
.
nor
could
contract
have
been
let
under
the
law
to
all
at
a
rate
to
have
brought
the
aggregate
within
the
appropriation
without
such
practical
prearrangement
of
term
a
would
have
violated
it
.
