``
with
the
experience
of
three
year
of
war
and
after
the
most
thorough
consideration
,
we
are
convinced
that
it
is
now
necessary
to
carry
out
the
statement
made
by
the
congress
in
the
joint
resolution
declaring
that
a
state
of
war
existed
with
japan
and
germany
:
that
'to
bring
the
conflict
to
a
successful
conclusion
,
all
of
the
resource
of
the
country
are
hereby
pledged
by
the
congress
of
the
united
state
.
