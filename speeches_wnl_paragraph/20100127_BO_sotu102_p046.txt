after
nearly
a
century
of
trying—democratic
administration
,
republican
administrations—we
are
closer
than
ever
to
bringing
more
security
to
the
life
of
so
many
american
.
the
approach
we
've
taken
would
protect
every
american
from
the
worst
practice
of
the
insurance
industry
.
it
would
give
small
business
and
uninsured
american
a
chance
to
choose
an
affordable
health
care
plan
in
a
competitive
market
.
it
would
require
every
insurance
plan
to
cover
preventive
care
.
