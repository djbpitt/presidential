there
should
be
a
general
law
of
congress
prohibiting
the
construction
of
bridge
over
navigable
water
in
such
manner
a
to
obstruct
navigation
,
with
provision
for
preventing
the
same
.
it
seems
that
under
existing
statute
the
government
can
not
intervene
to
prevent
such
a
construction
when
entered
upon
without
it
consent
,
though
when
such
consent
is
asked
and
granted
upon
condition
the
authority
to
insist
upon
such
condition
is
clear
.
thus
it
is
represented
that
while
the
officer
of
the
government
are
with
great
care
guarding
against
the
obstruction
of
navigation
by
a
bridge
across
the
mississippi
river
at
st.
paul
a
large
pier
for
a
bridge
ha
been
built
just
below
this
place
directly
in
the
navigable
channel
of
the
river
.
if
such
thing
are
to
be
permitted
,
a
strong
argument
is
presented
against
the
appropriation
of
large
sum
of
money
to
improve
the
navigation
of
this
and
other
important
highway
of
commerce
.
