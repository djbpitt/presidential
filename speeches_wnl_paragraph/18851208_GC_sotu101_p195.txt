whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
policy
of
subsidizing
any
line
of
public
conveyance
or
travel
,
i
am
satisfied
that
it
should
not
be
done
under
cover
of
an
expenditure
incident
to
the
administration
of
a
department
,
nor
should
there
be
any
uncertainty
a
to
the
recipient
of
the
subsidy
or
any
discretion
left
to
an
executive
officer
a
to
it
distribution
.
if
such
gift
of
the
public
money
are
to
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
any
enterprise
in
the
supposed
interest
of
the
public
,
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
amount
to
be
paid
and
the
beneficiary
might
better
be
determined
by
congress
than
in
any
other
way
.
