to
the
fact

island
have
succeeded
in
maintaining
a
stable
government
since
the
last
action
of
the
congress
in
their
behalf
,
and
have
thus
fulfilled
the
condition
set
by
the
congress
a
precedent
to
a
consideration
of
granting
independence
to
the
island
.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
condition
precedent
having
been
fulfilled
,
it
is
now
our
liberty
and
our
duty
to
keep
our
promise
to
the
people
of
those

by
granting
them
the
independence
