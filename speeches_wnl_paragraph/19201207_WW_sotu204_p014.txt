closely
connected
with
this
,
it
seems
to
me
,
is
the
necessity
for
an
immediate
consideration
of
the
revision
of
our
tax
law
.
simplification
of
the
income
and
profit
tax
ha
become
an
immediate
necessity
.
these
tax
performed
an
indispensable
service
during
the
war
.
the
need
for
their
simplification
,
however
,
is
very
great
,
in
order
to
save
the
taxpayer
inconvenience
and
expense
and
in
order
to
make
his
liability
more
certain
and
definite
.
other
and
more
detailed
recommendation
with
regard
to
tax
will
no
doubt
be
laid
before
you
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
.
