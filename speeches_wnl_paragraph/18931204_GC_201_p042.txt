at
the
time
spain
's
title
to
the
caroline
island
wa
confirmed
by
arbitration
that
government
agreed
that
the
right
which
had
been
acquired
there
by
american
missionary
should
be
recognized
and
respected
.
it
is
sincerely
hoped
that
this
pledge
will
be
observed
by
allowing
our
missionary
,
who
were
removed
from
ponape
to
a
place
of
safety
by
a
united
state
war
ship
during
the
late
trouble
between
the
spanish
garrison
and
the
native
,
to
return
to
their
field
of
usefulness
.
