in
the
light
of
our
substantial
material
progress
,
in
the
light
of
the
increasing
effectiveness
of
the
restoration
of
popular
rule
,
i
recommend
to
the
congress
that
we
advance
;
that
we
do
not
retreat
.
i
have
confidence
that
you
will
not
fail
the
people
of
the
nation
whose
mandate
you
have
already
so
faithfully
fulfilled
.
