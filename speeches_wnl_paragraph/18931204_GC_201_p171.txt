manifestly
if
we
are
to
aid
the
people
directly
through
tariff
reform
,
one
of
it
most
obvious
feature
should
be
a
reduction
in
present
tariff
charge
upon
the
necessary
of
life
.
the
benefit
of
such
a
reduction
would
be
palpable
and
substantial
,
seen
and
felt
by
thousand
who
would
be
better
fed
and
better
clothed
and
better
sheltered
.
these
gift
should
be
the
willing
benefaction
of
a
government
whose
highest
function
is
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
the
people
.
