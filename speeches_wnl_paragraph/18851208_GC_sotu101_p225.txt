threatening
and
disorderly
conduct
of
the
cheyenne
in
the
indian
territory
early
last
summer
caused
considerable
alarm
and
uneasiness
.
investigation
proved
that
their
threatening
attitude
wa
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
occupation
of
the
land
of
their
reservation
by
immense
herd
of
cattle
,
which
their
owner
claimed
were
rightfully
there
under
certain
lease
made
by
the
indian
.
such
occupation
appearing
upon
examination
to
be
unlawful
notwithstanding
these
lease
,
the
intruder
were
ordered
to
remove
with
their
cattle
from
the
land
of
the
indian
by
executive
proclamation
.
the
enforcement
of
this
proclamation
had
the
effect
of
restoring
peace
and
order
among
the
indian
,
and
they
are
now
quiet
and
well
behaved
