let
u
accept
that
high
responsibility
not
a
a
burden
,
but
gladly
--
gladly
because
the
chance
to
build
such
a
peace
is
the
noblest
endeavor
in
which
a
nation
can
engage
;
gladly
,
also
,
because
only
if
we
act
greatly
in
meeting
our
responsibility
abroad
will
we
remain
a
great
nation
,
and
only
if
we
remain
a
great
nation
will
we
act
greatly
in
meeting
our
challenge
at
home
.
