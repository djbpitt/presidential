the
most
reliable
indication
of
public
purpose
in
this
country
is
derived
through
our
popular
election
.
judging
by
the
recent
canvas
and
it
result
,
the
purpose
of
the
people
within
the
loyal
state
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
union
wa
never
more
firm
nor
more
nearly
unanimous
than
now
.
the
extraordinary
calmness
and
good
order
with
which
the
million
of
voter
met
and
mingled
at
the
poll
give
strong
assurance
of
this
.
not
only
all
those
who
supported
the
union
ticket
,
so
called
,
but
a
great
majority
of
the
opposing
party
also
may
be
fairly
claimed
to
entertain
and
to
be
actuated
by
the
same
purpose
.
it
is
an
unanswerable
argument
to
this
effect
that
no
candidate
for
any
officce
whatever
,
high
or
low
,
ha
ventured
to
seek
vote
on
the
avowal
that
he
wa
for
giving
up
the
union
.
there
have
been
much
impugning
of
motif
and
much
heated
controversy
a
to
the
proper
mean
and
best
mode
of
advancing
the
union
cause
,
but
on
the
distinct
issue
of
union
or
no
union
the
politician
have
shown
their
instinctive
knowledge
that
there
is
no
diversity
among
the
people
.
in
affording
the
people
the
fair
opportunity
of
showing
one
to
another
and
to
the
world
this
firmess
and
unanimity
of
purpose
,
the
election
ha
been
of
vast
value
to
the
national
cause
.
