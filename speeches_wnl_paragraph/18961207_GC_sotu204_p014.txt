the
insurrection
in
cuba
still
continues
with
all
it
perplexity
.
it
is
difficult
to
perceive
that
any
progress
ha
thus
far
been
made
toward
the
pacification
of
the
island
or
that
the
situation
of
affair
a
depicted
in
my
last
annual
message
ha
in
the
least
improved
.
if
spain
still
hold
havana
and
the
seaport
and
all
the
considerable
town
,
the
insurgent
still
roam
at
will
over
at
least
two-thirds
of
the
inland
country
.
if
the
determination
of
spain
to
put
down
the
insurrection
seems
but
to
strengthen
with
the
lapse
of
time
and
is
evinced
by
her
unhesitating
devotion
of
largely
increased
military
and
naval
force
to
the
task
,
there
is
much
reason
to
believe
that
the
insurgent
have
gained
in
point
of
number
and
character
and
resource
and
are
none
the
le
inflexible
in
their
resolve
not
to
succumb
without
practically
securing
the
great
object
for
which
they
took
up
arm
.
if
spain
ha
not
yet
reestablished
her
authority
,
neither
have
the
insurgent
yet
made
good
their
title
to
be
regarded
a
an
independent
state
.
indeed
,
a
the
contest
ha
gone
on
the
pretense
that
civil
government
exists
on
the
island
,
except
so
far
a
spain
is
able
to
maintain
it
,
ha
been
practically
abandoned
.
spain
doe
keep
on
foot
such
a
government
,
more
or
le
imperfectly
,
in
the
large
town
and
their
immediate
suburb
;
but
that
exception
being
made
,
the
entire
country
is
either
given
over
to
anarchy
or
is
subject
to
the
military
occupation
of
one
or
the
other
party
.
it
is
reported
,
indeed
,
on
reliable
authority
that
at
the
demand
of
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
insurgent
army
the
putative
cuban
government
ha
now
given
up
all
attempt
to
exercise
it
function
,
leaving
that
government
confessedly
(
what
there
is
the
best
reason
for
supposing
it
always
to
have
been
in
fact
)
a
government
merely
on
paper
.
