by
this
faith
,
and
by
this
faith
alone
,
can
the
world
be
lifted
out
of
it
present
confusion
and
despair
.
it
wa
this
faith
which
prevailed
over
the
wicked
force
of
germany
.
you
will
remember
that
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
war
came
when
the
german
people
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
conscience
of
the
world
and
realized
that
right
wa
everywhere
arrayed
against
the
wrong
that
their
government
wa
attempting
to
perpetrate
.
i
think
,
therefore
,
that
it
is
true
to
say
that
this
wa
the
faith
which
won
the
war
.
certainly
this
is
the
faith
with
which
our
gallant
men
went
into
the
field
and
out
upon
the
sea
to
make
sure
of
victory
.
