we
will
continue
to
go
through
the
budget
,
line
by
line
,
page
by
page
,
to
eliminate
program
that
we
ca
n't
afford
and
do
n't
work
.
we
've
already
identified
$
20
billion
in
saving
for
next
year
.
to
help
working
family
,
we
'll
extend
our
middle
class
tax
cut
.
but
at
a
time
of
record
deficit
,
we
will
not
continue
tax
cut
for
oil
company
,
for
investment
fund
manager
,
and
for
those
making
over
$
250,000

just
can't
afford
it
.
