these
are
some
of
the
thing
we
ought
to
do
,
and
not
leave
the
othersundone
,
the
old-fashioned
,
never-to-be-neglected
,
fundamental
safeguardingof
property
and
of
individual
right
.
this
is
the
high
enterprise
of
thenew
day
:
to
lift
everything
that
concern
our
life
a
a
nation
to
the
lightthat
shine
from
the
hearthfire
of
every
man's
conscience
and
vision
ofthe
right
.
it
is
inconceivable
that
we
should
do
this
a
partisan
;
itis
inconceivable
we
should
do
it
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
a
they
areor
in
blind
haste
.
we
shall
restore
,
not
destroy
.
we
shall
deal
with
oureconomic
system
a
it
is
and
a
it
may
be
modified
,
not
a
it
might
beif
we
had
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
to
write
upon
;
and
step
by
step
we
shallmake
it
what
it
should
be
,
in
the
spirit
of
those
who
question
their
ownwisdom
and
seek
counsel
and
knowledge
,
not
shallow
self-satisfaction
orthe
excitement
of
excursion
whither
they
can
not

.
justice
,
and

,
shall
always
be
our
