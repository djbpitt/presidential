the
total
number
of
inspection
of
cattle
for
export
during
the
past
fiscal
year
wa
611,542
.
the
export
show
a
falling
off
of
about
25
per
cent
from
the
preceding
year
,
the
decrease
occurring
entirely
in
the
last
half
of
the
year
.
this
suggests
that
the
falling
off
may
have
been
largely
due
to
an
increase
in
the
price
of
american
export
cattle
.
