from
the
day
i
took
office
,
i
've
been
told
that
addressing
our
larger
challenge
is
too
ambitious
;
such
an
effort
would
be
too
contentious
.
i
've
been
told
that
our
political
system
is
too
gridlocked
and
that
we
should
just
put
thing
on
hold
for
a
while
.
for
those
who
make
these
claim
,
i
have
one
simple
question
:
how
long
should
we
wait
?
how
long
should
america
put
it
future
on
hold
?
