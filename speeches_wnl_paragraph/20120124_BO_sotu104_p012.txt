the
state
of
our
union
is
getting
stronger
.
and
we
've
come
too
far
to
turn
back
now
.
a
long
a
i
'm
president
,
i
will
work
with
anyone
in
this
chamber
to
build
on
this
momentum
.
but
i
intend
to
fight
obstruction
with
action
,
and
i
will
oppose
any
effort
to
return
to
the
very
same
policy
that
brought
on
this
economic
crisis
in
the
first
place
.
