the
act
passed
at
the
last
session
for
the
encouragement
of
immigration
ha
so
far
a
wa
possible
been
put
into
operation
.
it
seems
to
need
amendment
which
will
enable
the
officer
of
the
government
to
prevent
the
practice
of
fraud
against
the
immigrant
while
on
their
way
and
on
their
arrival
in
the
port
,
so
a
to
secure
them
here
a
free
choice
of
avocation
and
place
of
settlement
.
a
liberal
disposition
toward
this
great
national
policy
is
manifested
by
most
of
the
european
state
,
and
ought
to
be
reciprocated
on
our
part
by
giving
the
immigrant
effective
national
protection
.
i
regard
our
immigrant
a
one
of
the
principal
replenishing
stream
which
are
appointed
by
providence
to
repair
the
ravage
of
internal
war
and
it
waste
of
national
strength
and
health
.
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
secure
the
flow
of
that
stream
in
it
present
fullness
,
and
to
that
end
the
government
must
in
every
way
make
it
manifest
that
it
neither
need
nor
design
to
impose
involuntary
military
service
upon
those
who
come
from
other
land
to
cast
their
lot
in
our
country
.
