the
war
continues
.
in
considering
the
policy
to
be
adopted
for
suppressing
the
insurrection
i
have
been
anxious
and
careful
that
the
inevitable
conflict
for
this
purpose
shall
not
degenerate
into
a
violent
and
remorseless
revolutionary
struggle
.
i
have
therefore
in
every
case
thought
it
proper
to
keep
the
integrity
of
the
union
prominent
a
the
primary
object
of
the
contest
on
our
part
,
leaving
all
question
which
are
not
of
vital
military
importance
to
the
more
deliberate
action
of
the
legislature
.
