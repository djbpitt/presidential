our
bureau
of
mine
ought
to
be
equipped
and
empowered
to
render
even
more
effectual
service
than
it
render
now
in
improving
the
condition
of
mine
labor
and
making
the
mine
more
economically
productive
a
well
a
more
safe
.
this
is
an
all-important
part
of
the
work
of
conservation
;
and
the
conservation
of
human
life
and
energy
lie
even
nearer
to
our
interest
than
the
preservation
from
waste
of
our
material
resource
.
