that
,
unfortunately
,
is
not
so
clear
.
it
might
be
true
that
the
mass
of
the
people
in
those
nation
would
change
the
policy
of
their
government
if
they
could
be
allowed
full
freedom
and
full
access
to
the
process
of
democratic
government
a
we
understand
them
.
but
they
do
not
have
that
access
;
lacking
it
they
follow
blindly
and
fervently
the
lead
of
those
who
seek
autocratic
power
.
