if
you
and
i
in
this
later
day
lose
that
sacred
fire—if
we
let
it
be
smothered
with
doubt
and
fear—then
we
shall
reject
the
destiny
which
washington
strove
so
valiantly
and
so
triumphantly
to
establish
.
the
preservation
of
the
spirit
and
faith
of
the
nation
doe
,
and
will
,
furnish
the
highest
justification
for
every
sacrifice
that
we
may
make
in
the
cause
of
national
defense
.
