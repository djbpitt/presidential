the
people
of
germany
are
being
told
by
the
men
whom
they
now
permit
to
deceive
them
and
to
act
a
their
master
that
they
are
fighting
for
the
very
life
and
existence
of
their
empire
,
a
war
of
desperate
self-defense
against
deliberate
aggression
.
nothing
could
be
more
grossly
or
wantonly
false
,
and
we
must
seek
by
the
utmost
openness
and
candor
a
to
our
real
aim
to
convince
them
of
it
falseness
.
we
are
in
fact
fighting
for
their
emancipation
from
fear
,
along
with
our
own
--
from
the
fear
a
well
a
from
the
fact
of
unjust
attack
by
neighbor
or
rival
or
schemer
after
world
empire
.
no
one
is
threatening
the
existence
or
the
independence
or
the
peaceful
enterprise
of
the
german
empire
.
