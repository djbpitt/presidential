before
entering
upon
so
grave
a
matter
a
the
destruction
of
our
national
fabric
,
with
all
it
benefit
,
it
memory
,
and
it
hope
,
would
it
not
be
wise
to
ascertain
precisely
why
we
do
it
?
will
you
hazard
so
desperate
a
step
while
there
is
any
possibility
that
any
portion
of
the
ill
you
fly
from
have
no
real
existence
?
will
you
,
while
the
certain
ill
you
fly
to
are
greater
than
all
the
real
one
you
fly
fromâ€”will
you
risk
the
commission
of
so
fearful
a
mistake
?
