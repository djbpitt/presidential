under
section
3659
of
the
revised
statute
all
fund
held
in
trust
by
the
united
state
and
the
annual
interest
accruing
thereon
,
when
not
otherwise
required
by
treaty
,
are
to
be
invested
in
stock
of
the
united
state
bearing
a
rate
of
interest
not
le
than
5
per
cent
per
annum
.
there
being
now
no
procurable
stock
paying
so
high
a
rate
of
interest
,
the
letter
of
the
statute
is
at
present
inapplicable
,
but
it
spirit
is
subserved
by
continuing
to
make
investment
of
this
nature
in
current
stock
bearing
the
highest
interest
now
paid
.
the
statute
,
however
,
make
no
provision
for
the
disposal
of
such
accretion
.
it
being
contrary
to
the
general
rule
of
this
government
to
allow
interest
on
claim
,
i
recommend
the
repeal
of
the
provision
in
question
and
the
disposition
,
under
a
uniform
rule
,
of
the
present
accumulation
from
investment
of
trust
fund
.
