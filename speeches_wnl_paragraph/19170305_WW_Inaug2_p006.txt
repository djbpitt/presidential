and
yet
all
the
while
we
have
been
conscious
that
we
were
not
part
ofit
.
in
that
consciousness
,
despite
many
division
,
we
have
drawn
closertogether
.
we
have
been
deeply
wronged
upon
the
sea
,
but
we
have
not
wishedto
wrong
or
injure
in
return
;
have
retained
throughout
the
consciousnessof
standing
in
some
sort
apart
,
intent
upon
an
interest
that
transcendedthe
immediate
issue
of
the
war
itself
.
