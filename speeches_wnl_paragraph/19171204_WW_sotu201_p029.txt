we
can
do
this
with
all
the
greater
zeal
and
enthusiasm
because
we
know
that
for
u
this
is
a
war
of
high
principle
,
debased
by
no
selfish
ambition
of
conquest
or
spoliation
;
because
we
know
,
and
all
the
world
know
,
that
we
have
been
forced
into
it
to
save
the
very
institution
we
live
under
from
corruption
and
destruction
.
the
purpose
of
the
central
power
strike
straight
at
the
very
heart
of
everything
we
believe
in
;
their
method
of
warfare
outrage
every
principle
of
humanity
and
of
knightly
honor
;
their
intrigue
ha
corrupted
the
very
thought
and
spirit
of
many
of
our
people
;
their
sinister
and
secret
diplomacy
ha
sought
to
take
our
very
territory
away
from
u
and
disrupt
the
union
of
the
state
.
our
safety
would
be
at
an
end
,
our
honor
forever
sullied
and
brought
into
contempt
were
we
to
permit
their
triumph
.
they
are
striking
at
the
very
existence
of
democracy
and
liberty
.
