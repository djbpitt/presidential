by
the
article
establishing
the
executive
department
,
it
is
made
the
duty
of
the
president
``
to
recommend
to
your
consideration
,
such
measure
a
he
shall
judge
necessary
and
expedient
.
''
the
circumstance
under
which
i
now
meet
you
,
will
acquit
me
from
entering
into
that
subject
,
farther
than
to
refer
to
the
great
constitutional
charter
under
which
you
are
assembled
;
and
which
,
in
defining
your
power
,
designates
the
object
to
which
your
attention
is
to
be
given
.
it
will
be
more
consistent
with
those
circumstance
,
and
far
more
congenial
with
the
feeling
which
actuate
me
,
to
substitute
,
in
place
of
a
recommendation
of
particular
measure
,
the
tribute
that
is
due
to
the
talent
,
the
rectitude
,
and
the
patriotism
which
adorn
the
character
selected
to
devise
and
adopt
them
.
in
these
honorable
qualification
,
i
behold
the
surest
pledge
,
that
a
on
one
side
,
no
local
prejudice
,
or
attachment
;
no
seperate
view
,
nor
party
animosity
,
will
misdirect
the
comprehensive
and
equal
eye
which
ought
to
watch
over
this
great
assemblage
of
community
and
interest
:
so
,
on
another
,
that
the
foundation
of
our
national
policy
will
be
laid
in
the
pure
and
immutable
principle
of
private
morality
;
and
the
pre-eminence
of
a
free
government
,
be
exemplified
by
all
the
attribute
which
can
win
the
affection
of
it
citizen
,
and
command
the
respect
of
the
world
.
