it
is
not
too
late
in
the
war
.
in
fact
,
bitter
experience
ha
shown
that
in
this
kind
of
mechanized
warfare
where
new
weapon
are
constantly
being
created
by
our
enemy
and
by
ourselves
,
the
closer
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
war
,
the
more
pressing
becomes
the
need
for
sustained
war
production
with
which
to
deliver
the
final
blow
to
the
enemy
.
