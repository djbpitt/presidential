i
shall
not
go
back
to
debate
the
cause
of
the
war
.
the
intolerable
wrong
done
and
planned
against
u
by
the
sinister
master
of
germany
have
long
since
become
too
grossly
obvious
and
odious
to
every
true
american
to
need
to
be
rehearsed
.
but
i
shall
ask
you
to
consider
again
and
with
a
very
grave
scrutiny
our
objective
and
the
measure
by
which
we
mean
to
attain
them
;
for
the
purpose
of
discussion
here
in
this
place
is
action
,
and
our
action
must
move
straight
towards
definite
end
.
our
object
is
,
of
course
,
to
win
the
war
;
and
we
shall
not
slacken
or
suffer
ourselves
to
be
diverted
until
it
is
won
.
but
it
is
worth
while
asking
and
answering
the
question
,
when
shall
we
consider
the
war
won
?
