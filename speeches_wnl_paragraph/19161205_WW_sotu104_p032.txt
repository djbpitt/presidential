may
i
not
urge
it
early
and
favorable
consideration
by
the
house
of
representative
and
it
early
enactment
into
law
?
it
contains
plan
which
affect
all
interest
and
all
part
of
the
country
,
and
i
am
sure
that
there
is
no
legislation
now
pending
before
the
congress
whose
passage
the
country
awaits
with
more
thoughtful
approval
or
greater
impatience
to
see
a
great
and
admirable
thing
set
in
the
way
of
being
done
.
