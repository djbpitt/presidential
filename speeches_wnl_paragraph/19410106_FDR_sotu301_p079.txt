a
part
of
the
sacrifice
mean
the
payment
of
more
money
in
tax
.
in
my
budget
message
i
shall
recommend
that
a
greater
portion
of
this
great
defense
program
be
paid
for
from
taxation
than
we
are
paying
today
.
no
person
should
try
,
or
be
allowed
,
to
get
rich
out
of
this
program
;
and
the
principle
of
tax
payment
in
accordance
with
ability
to
pay
should
be
constantly
before
our
eye
to
guide
our
legislation
.
