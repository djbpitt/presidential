we
owe
it
,
however
,
to
ourselves
to
say
that
we
do
not
wish
in
any
way
to
impair
or
to
rearrange
the
austro-hungarian
empire
.
it
is
no
affair
of
ours
what
they
do
with
their
own
life
,
either
industrially
or
politically
.
we
do
not
purpose
or
desire
to
dictate
to
them
in
any
way
.
we
only
desire
to
see
that
their
affair
are
left
in
their
own
hand
,
in
all
matter
,
great
or
small
.
we
shall
hope
to
secure
for
the
people
of
the
balkan
peninsula
and
for
the
people
of
the
turkish
empire
the
right
and
opportunity
to
make
their
own
life
safe
,
their
own
fortune
secure
against
oppression
or
injustice
and
from
the
dictation
of
foreign
court
or
party
.
