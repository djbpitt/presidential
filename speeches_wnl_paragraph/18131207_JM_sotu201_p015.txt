the
systematic
perseverance
of
the
enemy
in
courting
the
aid
of
the
savage
in
all
quarter
had
the
natural
effect
of
kindling
their
ordinary
propensity
to
war
into
a
passion
,
which
,
even
among
those
best
disposed
toward
the
united
state
,
wa
ready
,
if
not
employed
on
our
side
,
to
be
turned
against
u
.
a
departure
from
our
protracted
forbearance
to
accept
the
service
tendered
by
them
ha
thus
been
forced
upon
u
.
but
in
yielding
to
it
the
retaliation
ha
been
mitigated
a
much
a
possible
,
both
in
it
extent
and
in
it
character
,
stopping
far
short
of
the
example
of
the
enemy
,
who
owe
the
advantage
they
have
occasionally
gained
in
battle
chiefly
to
the
#
of
their
savage
associate
,
and
who
have
not
controlled
them
either
from
their
usual
practice
of
indiscriminate
massacre
on
defenseless
inhabitant
or
from
scene
of
carnage
without
a
parallel
on
prisoner
to
the
british
arm
,
guarded
by
all
the
law
of
humanity
and
of
honorable
war
.
for
these
enormity
the
enemy
are
equally
responsible
,
whether
with
the
power
to
prevent
them
they
want
the
will
or
with
the
knowledge
of
a
want
of
power
they
still
avail
themselves
of
such
instrument
