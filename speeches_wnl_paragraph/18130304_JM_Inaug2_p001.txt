to
add
the
solemnity
of
an
oath
to
the
obligation
imposed
by
a
second
call
to
the
station
in
which
my
country
heretofore
placed
me
,
i
find
in

assembly
an
opportunity

publicly
repeating
my

so

united
with
it

my

endeavor
to
discharge
my
arduous
duty
have
been
favorably
estimated
,

reliance
on
the
support
of
an
enlightened

a
conviction
that
the
war
with
a
