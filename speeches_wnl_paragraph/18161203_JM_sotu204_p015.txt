the
importance
which
i
have
attached
to
the
establishment
of
a
university
within
this
district
on
a
scale
and
for
object
worthy
of
the
american
nation
induces
me
to
renew
my
recommendation
of
it
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
.
and
i
particularly
invite
again
their
attention
to
the
expediency
of
exercising
their
existing
power
,
and
,
where
necessary
,
of
resorting
to
the
prescribed
mode
of
enlarging
them
,
in
order
to
effectuate
a
comprehensive
system
of
road
and
canal
,
such
a
will
have
the
effect
of
drawing
more
closely
together
every
part
of
our
country
by
promoting
intercourse
and
improvement
and
by
increasing
the
share
of
every
part
in
the
common
stock
of
national
prosperity
.
