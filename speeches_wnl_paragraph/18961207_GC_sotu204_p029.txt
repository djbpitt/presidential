the
venezuelan
boundary
question
ha
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
difference
between
great
britain
and
the
united
state
,
their
respective
government
having
agreed
upon
the
substantial
provision
of
a
treaty
between
great
britain
and
venezuela
submitting
the
whole
controversy
to
arbitration
.
the
provision
of
the
treaty
are
so
eminently
just
and
fair
that
the
assent
of
venezuela
thereto
may
confidently
be
anticipated
.
