having
essayed
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
to
procure
by
negotiation
the
settlement
of
a
long-standing
cause
of
dispute
and
to
remove
a
constant
menace
to
the
good
relation
of
the
two
country
,
and
continuing
to
be
of
opinion
that
the
treaty
of
february
last
,
which
failed
to
receive
the
approval
of
the
senate
,
did
supply
``
a
satisfactory
,
practical
,
and
final
adjustment
,
upon
a
basis
honorable
and
just
to
both
party
,
of
the
difficult
and
vexed
question
to
which
it
related
,
''
and
having
subsequently
and
unavailingly
recommended
other
legislation
to
congress
which
i
hoped
would
suffice
to
meet
the
exigency
created
by
the
rejection
of
the
treaty
,
i
now
again
invoke
the
earnest
and
immediate
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
condition
of
this
important
question
a
it
now
stand
before
them
and
the
country
,
and
for
the
settlement
of
which
i
am
deeply
solicitous
.
