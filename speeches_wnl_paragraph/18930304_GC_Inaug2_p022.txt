while
there
should
be
no
surrender
of
principle
,
our
task
must
be
undertakenwisely
and
without
heedless
vindictiveness
.
our
mission
is
not
punishment
,
but
the
rectification
of
wrong
.
if
in
lifting
burden
from
the
daily
lifeof
our
people
we
reduce
inordinate
and
unequal
advantage
too
long
enjoyed
,
this
is
but
a
necessary
incident
of
our
return
to
right
and
justice
.
ifwe
exact
from
unwilling
mind
acquiescence
in
the
theory
of
an
honest
distributionof
the
fund
of
the
governmental
beneficence
treasured
up
for
all
,
we
butinsist
upon
a
principle
which
underlies
our
free
institution
.
when
wetear
aside
the
delusion
and
misconception
which
have
blinded
our
countrymento
their
condition
under
vicious
tariff
law
,
we
but
show
them
how
farthey
have
been
led
away
from
the
path
of
contentment
and
prosperity
.
whenwe
proclaim
that
the
necessity
for
revenue
to
support
the
government
furnishesthe
only
justification
for
taxing
the
people
,
we
announce
a
truth
so
plainthat
it
denial
would
seem
to
indicate
the
extent
to
which
judgment
maybe
influenced
by
familiarity
with
perversion
of
the
taxing
power
.
andwhen
we
seek
to
reinstate
the
self-confidence
and
business
enterprise
ofour
citizen
by
discrediting
an
abject
dependence
upon
governmental
favor
,
we
strive
to
stimulate
those
element
of
american
character
which
supportthe
hope
of
american
achievement
.
