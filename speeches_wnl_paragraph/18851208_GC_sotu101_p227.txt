the
public
domain
had
it
origin
in
cession
of
land
by
the
state
to
the
general
government
.
the
first
cession
wa
made
by
the
state
of
new
york
,
and
the
largest
,
which
in
area
exceeded
all
the
others
,
by
the
state
of
virginia
.
the
territory
the
proprietorship
of
which
became
thus
vested
in
the
general
government
extended
from
the
western
line
of
pennsylvania
to
the
mississippi
river
.
these
patriotic
donation
of
the
state
were
encumbered
with
no
condition
except
that
they
should
the
held
and
used
``
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
united
state
.
''
by
purchase
with
the
common
fund
of
all
the
people
addition
were
made
to
this
domain
until
it
extended
to
the
northern
line
of
mexico
,
the
pacific
ocean
,
and
the
polar
sea
.
the
original
trust
,
``
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
united
state
,
''
attached
to
all
.
in
the
execution
of
that
trust
the
policy
of
many
home
,
rather
than
large
estate
,
wa
adopted
by
the
government
.
that
these
might
be
easily
obtained
,
and
be
the
abode
of
security
and
contentment
,
the
law
for
their
acquisition
were
few
,
easily
understood
,
and
general
in
their
character
.
but
the
pressure
of
local
interest
,
combined
with
a
speculative
spirit
,
have
in
many
instance
procured
the
passage
of
law
which
marred
the
harmony
of
the
general
plan
and
encumbered
the
system
with
a
multitude
of
general
and
special
enactment
which
render
the
land
law
complicated
,
subject
the
title
to
uncertainty
,
and
the
purchaser
often
to
oppression
and
wrong
.
law
which
were
intended
for
the
``
common
benefit
''
have
been
perverted
so
that
large
quantity
of
land
are
vesting
in
single
ownership
.
from
the
multitude
and
character
of
the
law
,
this
consequence
seems
incapable
of
correction
by
mere
administration
.
