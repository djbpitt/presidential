the
laxity
of
idea
prevailing
among
a
large
number
of
our
people
regarding
pension
is
becoming
every
day
more
marked
.
the
principle
upon
which
they
should
be
granted
are
in
danger
of
being
altogether
ignored
,
and
already
pension
are
often
claimed
because
the
applicant
are
a
much
entitled
a
other
successful
applicant
,
rather
than
upon
any
disability
reasonably
attributable
to
military
service
.
if
the
establishment
of
vicious
precedent
be
continued
,
if
the
granting
of
pension
be
not
divorced
from
partisan
and
other
unworthy
and
irrelevant
consideration
,
and
if
the
honorable
name
of
veteran
unfairly
becomes
by
these
mean
but
another
term
for
one
who
constantly
clamor
for
the
aid
of
the
government
,
there
is
danger
that
injury
will
be
done
to
the
fame
and
patriotism
of
many
whom
our
citizen
all
delight
to
honor
,
and
that
a
prejudice
will
be
aroused
unjust
to
meritorious
applicant
for
pension
.
