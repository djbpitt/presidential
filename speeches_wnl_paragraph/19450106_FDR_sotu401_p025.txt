we
had
in
europe
two
active
and
indomitable
allies-
britain
and
the
soviet
union-
and
there
were
also
the
heroic
resistance
movement
in
the
occupied
country
,
constantly
engaging
and
harassing
the
german
.
we
can
not
forget
how
britain
held
the
line
,
alone
,
in
1940
and
1941
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
despite
ferocious
bombardment
from
the
air
,
built
up
a
tremendous
armament
industry
which
enabled
her
to
take
the
offensive
at
el
alamein
in
1942
.
