the
british
cabinet
,
either
mistaking
our
desire
of
peace
for
a
dread
of
british
power
or
misled
by
other
fallacious
calculation
,
ha
disappointed
this
reasonable
anticipation
.
no
communication
from
our
envoy
having
reached
u
,
no
information
on
the
subject
ha
been
received
from
that
source
;
but
it
is
known
that
the
mediation
wa
declined
in
the
1st
instance
,
and
there
is
no
evidence
,
notwithstanding
the
lapse
of
time
,
that
a
change
of
disposition
in
the
british
council
ha
taken
place
or
is
to
be
expected
.
