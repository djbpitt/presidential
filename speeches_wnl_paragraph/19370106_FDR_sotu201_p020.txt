and
,
of
course
,
the
most
far-reaching
and
the
most
inclusive
problem
of
all
is
that
of
unemployment
and
the
lack
of
economic
balance
of
which
unemployment
is
at
once
the
result
and
the
symptom
.
the
immediate
question
of
adequate
relief
for
the
needy
unemployed
who
are
capable
of
performing
useful
work
,
i
shall
discus
with
the
congress
during
the
coming
month
.
the
broader
task
of
preventing
unemployment
is
a
matter
of
long-range
evolutionary
policy
.
to
that
we
must
continue
to
give
our
best
thought
and
effort
.
we
can
not
assume
that
immediate
industrial
and
commercial
activity
which
mitigates
present
pressure
justifies
the
national
government
at
this
time
in
placing
the
unemployment
problem
in
a
filing
cabinet
of
finished
business
.
