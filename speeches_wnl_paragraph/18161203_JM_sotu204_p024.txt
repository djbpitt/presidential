upon
this
general
view
of
the
subject
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
only
wanting
to
the
fiscal
prosperity
of
the
government
the
restoration
of
an
uniform
medium
of
exchange
.
the
resource
and
the
faith
of
the
nation
,
displayed
in
the
system
which
congress
ha
established
,
insure
respect
and
confidence
both
at
home
and
abroad
.
the
local
accumulation
of
the
revenue
have
already
enabled
the
treasury
to
meet
the
public
engagement
in
the
local
currency
of
most
of
the
state
,
and
it
is
expected
that
the
same
cause
will
produce
the
same
effect
throughout
the
union
;
but
for
the
interest
of
the
community
at
large
,
a
well
a
for
the
purpose
of
the
treasury
,
it
is
essential
that
the
nation
should
posse
a
currency
of
equal
value
,
credit
,
and
use
wherever
it
may
circulate
.
the
constitution
ha
intrusted
congress
exclusively
with
the
power
of
creating
and
regulating
a
currency
of
that
description
,
and
the
measure
which
were
taken
during
the
last
session
in
execution
of
the
power
give
every
promise
of
success
.
the
bank
of
the
united
state
ha
been
organized
under
auspex
the
most
favorable
,
and
can
not
fail
to
be
an
important
auxiliary
to
those
measure
.
