the
happiness
of
future
generation
of
american
may
well
depend
upon
how
effective
and
how
immediate
we
can
make
our
aid
felt
.
no
one
can
tell
the
exact
character
of
the
emergency
situation
that
we
may
be
called
upon
to
meet
.
the
nation
's
hand
must
not
be
tied
when
the
nation
's
life
is
in
danger
.
