and
in
afghanistan
,
we
're
increasing
our
troop
and
training
afghan
security
force
so
they
can
begin
to
take
the
lead
in
july
of
2011
and
our
troop
can
begin
to
come
home
.
we
will
reward
good
governance
,
work
to
reduce
corruption
,
and
support
the
right
of
all
afghan
,
men
and
woman
alike
.
we
're
joined
by
ally
and
partner
who
have
increased
their
own
commitment
and
who
will
come
together
tomorrow
in
london
to
reaffirm
our
common
purpose
.
there
will
be
difficult
day
ahead
,
but
i
am
absolutely
confident
we
will
succeed
.
