on
the
coast
and
on
the
ocean
the
war
ha
been
a
successful
a
circumstance
inseparable
from
it
early
stage
could
promise
.
our
public
ship
and
private
cruiser
,
by
their
activity
,
and
,
where
there
wa
occasion
,
by
their
intrepidity
,
have
made
the
enemy
sensible
of
the
difference
between
a
reciprocity
of
capture
and
the
long
confinement
of
them
to
their
side
.
our
trade
,
with
little
exception
,
ha
safely
reached
our
port
,
having
been
much
favored
in
it
by
the
course
pursued
by
a
squadron
of
our
frigate
under
the
command
of
commodore
rodgers
,
and
in
the
instance
in
which
skill
and
bravery
were
more
particularly
tried
with
those
of
the
enemy
the
american
flag
had
an
auspicious
triumph
.
the
frigate
constitution
,
commanded
by
captain
hull
,
after
a
close
and
short
engagement
completely
disabled
and
captured
a
british
frigate
,
gaining
for
that
officer
and
all
on
board
a
praise
which
can
not
be
too
liberally
bestowed
,
not
merely
for
the
victory
actually
achieved
,
but
for
that
prompt
and
cool
exertion
of
commanding
talent
which
,
giving
to
courage
it
highest
character
,
and
to
the
force
applied
it
full
effect
,
proved
that
more
could
have
been
done
in
a
contest
requiring
more
