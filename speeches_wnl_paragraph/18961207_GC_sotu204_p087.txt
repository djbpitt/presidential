our
mail
service
should
of
course
be
such
a
to
meet
the
want
and
even
the
convenience
of
our
people
at
a
direct
charge
upon
them
so
light
a
perhaps
to
exclude
the
idea
of
our
post-office
department
being
a
money-making
concern
;
but
in
the
face
of
a
constantly
recurring
deficiency
in
it
revenue
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
supply
the
best
mail
service
in
the
world
it
seems
to
me
it
is
quite
time
to
correct
the
abuse
that
swell
enormously
our
annual
deficit
.
if
we
concede
the
public
policy
of
carrying
weekly
newspaper
free
in
the
county
of
publication
,
and
even
the
policy
of
carrying
at
le
than
one-tenth
of
their
cost
other
bona
fide
newspaper
and
periodical
,
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
subjecting
the
service
to
the
further
immense
and
increasing
loss
involved
in
carrying
at
the
nominal
rate
of
1
cent
a
pound
the
serial
library
,
sometimes
including
trashy
and
even
harmful
literature
,
and
other
matter
which
under
the
loose
interpretation
of
a
loose
statute
have
been
gradually
given
second-class
rate
,
thus
absorbing
all
profitable
return
derived
from
first-class
matter
,
which
pay
three
or
four
time
more
than
it
cost
,
and
producing
a
large
annual
loss
to
be
paid
by
general
taxation
.
if
such
second-class
matter
paid
merely
the
cost
of
it
handling
,
our
deficit
would
disappear
and
a
surplus
result
which
might
be
used
to
give
the
people
still
better
mail
facility
or
cheaper
rate
of
letter
postage
.
i
recommend
that
legislation
be
at
once
enacted
to
correct
these
abuse
and
introduce
better
business
idea
in
the
regulation
of
our
postal
rate
.
