we
've
made
it
clear
that
america
is
a
pacific
power
,
and
a
new
beginning
in
burma
ha
lit
a
new
hope
.
from
the
coalition
we
've
built
to
secure
nuclear
material
,
to
the
mission
we
've
led
against
hunger
and
disease
,
from
the
blow
we
've
dealt
to
our
enemy
,
to
the
enduring
power
of
our
moral
example
,
america
is
back
.
