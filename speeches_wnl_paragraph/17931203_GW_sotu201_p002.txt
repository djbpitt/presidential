since
the
commencement
of
the
term
for
which
i
have
been
again
called
into
office
no
fit
occasion
ha
arisen
for
expressing
to
me
fellow
citizen
at
large
the
deep
and
respectful
sense
which
i
feel
of
the
renewed
testimony
of
public
approbation
.
while
on
the
one
hand
it
awakened
my
gratitude
for
all
those
instance
of
affectionate
partiality
with
which
i
have
been
honored
by
my
country
,
on
the
other
it
could
not
prevent
an
earnest
wish
for
that
retirement
from
which
no
private
consideration
should
ever
have
torn
me
.
but
influenced
by
the
belief
that
my
conduct
would
be
estimated
according
to
it
real
motif
,
and
that
the
people
,
and
the
authority
derived
from
them
,
would
support
exertion
having
nothing
personal
for
their
object
,
i
have
obeyed
the
suffrage
which
commanded
me
to
resume
the
executive
power
;
and
i
humbly
implore
that
being
on
whose
will
the
fate
of
nation
depends
to
crown
with
success
our
mutual
endeavor
for
the
general
happiness
.
