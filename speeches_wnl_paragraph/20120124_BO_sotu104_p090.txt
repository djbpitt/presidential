a
the
tide
of
war
recedes
,
a
wave
of
change
ha
washed
across
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
,
from
tunis
to
cairo
,
from
sana'a
to
tripoli
.
a
year
ago
,
qadhafi
wa
one
of
the
world
's
longest
serving
dictator
,
a
murderer
with
american
blood
on
his
hand
.
today
,
he
is
gone
.
and
in
syria
,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
asad
regime
will
soon
discover
that
the
force
of
change
can
not
be
reversed
and
that
human
dignity
can
not
be
denied
.
