one
very
embarrassing
obstacle
that
stand
in
our
way
is
that
we
are
at
war
with
germany
but
not
with
her
ally
.
i
therefore
very
earnestly
recommend
that
the
congress
immediately
declare
the
united
state
in
a
state
of
war
with
austria-hungary
.
doe
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
this
should
be
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
i
have
just
addressed
to
you
?
it
is
not
.
it
is
in
fact
the
inevitable
logic
of
what
i
have
said
.
austria-hungary
is
for
the
time
being
not
her
own
mistress
but
simply
the
vassal
of
the
german
government
.
we
must
face
the
fact
a
they
are
and
act
upon
them
without
sentiment
in
this
stern
business
.
the
government
of
austria-hungary
is
not
acting
upon
it
own
initiative
or
in
response
to
the
wish
and
feeling
of
it
own
people
but
a
the
instrument
of
another
nation
.
we
must
meet
it
force
with
our
own
and
regard
the
central
power
a
but
one
.
the
war
can
be
successfully
conducted
in
no
other
way
.
the
same
logic
would
lead
also
to
a
declaration
of
war
against
turkey
and
bulgaria
.
they
also
are
the
tool
of
germany
.
but
they
are
mere
tool
and
do
not
yet
stand
in
the
direct
path
of
our
necessary
action
.
we
shall
go
wherever
the
necessity
of
this
war
carry
u
,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
go
only
where
immediate
and
practical
consideration
lead
u
and
not
heed
any
others
.
