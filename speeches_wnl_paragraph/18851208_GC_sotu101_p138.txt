this
conference
absolutely
failed
,
and
a
similar
fate
ha
awaited
all
subsequent
effort
in
the
same
direction
.
and
still
we
continue
our
coinage
of
silver
at
a
ratio
different
from
that
of
any
other
nation
.
the
most
vital
part
of
the
silver-coinage
act
remains
inoperative
and
unexecuted
,
and
without
an
ally
or
friend
we
battle
upon
the
silver
field
in
an
illogical
and
losing
contest
.
