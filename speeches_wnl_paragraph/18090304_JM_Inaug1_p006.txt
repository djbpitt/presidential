it
is
my
good
fortune
,
moreover
,
to
have
the
path
in
which
i
am
to
tread
lighted
by
example
of
illustrious
service
successfully
rendered
in
the
most
trying
difficulty
by
those
who
have
marched
before
me
.
of
those
of
my
immediate
predecessor
it
might
least
become
me
here
to
speak
.
i
may
,
however
,
be
pardoned
for
not
suppressing
the
sympathy
with
which
my
heart
is
full
in
the
rich
reward
he
enjoys
in
the
benediction
of
a
beloved
country
,
gratefully
bestowed
or
exalted
talent
zealously
devoted
through
a
long
career
to
the
advancement
