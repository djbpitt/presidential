ha
lately
testified
it
friendliness
by
surrendering
to
the
united
state
,
in
the
absence
of
a
convention
of
extradition
,
but
upon
duly
submitted
evidence
of
criminality
,
a
noted
fugitive
from
justice
.
it
is
trusted
that
the
negotiation
of
a
treaty
with
that
country
to
meet
recurring
case
of
this
kind
will
soon
be
accomplished
.
in
my
opinion
treaty
for
reciprocal
extradition
should
be
concluded
with
all
those
country
with
which
the
united
state
ha
not
already
conventional
arrangement
of
that
character
.
