another
example
is
the
prevalence
of
an
un-american
type
of
tenant
farming
.
i
do
not
suggest
that
every
farm
family
ha
the
capacity
to
earn
a
satisfactory
living
on
it
own
farm
.
but
many
thousand
of
tenant
farmer
,
indeed
most
of
them
,
with
some
financial
assistance
and
with
some
advice
and
training
,
can
be
made
self-supporting
on
land
which
can
eventually
belong
to
them
.
the
nation
would
be
wise
to
offer
them
that
chance
instead
of
permitting
them
to
go
along
a
they
do
now
,
year
after
year
,
with
neither
future
security
a
tenant
nor
hope
of
ownership
of
their
home
nor
expectation
of
bettering
the
lot
of
their
child
.
