now
,
the
price
of
college
tuition
is
just
one
of
the
burden
facing
the
middle
class
.
that
's
why
last
year
,
i
asked
vice
president
biden
to
chair
a
task
force
on
middle
class
family
.
that
's
why
we
're
nearly
doubling
the
child
care
tax
credit
and
making
it
easier
to
save
for
retirement
by
giving
access
to
every
worker
a
retirement
account
and
expanding
the
tax
credit
for
those
who
start
a
nest
egg
.
that
's
why
we
're
working
to
lift
the
value
of
a
family
's
single
largest
investment
,
their
home
.
the
step
we
took
last
year
to
shore
up
the
housing
market
have
allowed
million
of
american
to
take
out
new
loan
and
save
an
average
of
$
1,500
on
mortgage
payment
.
this
year
,
we
will
step
up
refinancing
so
that
homeowner
can
move
into
more
affordable
mortgage
.
