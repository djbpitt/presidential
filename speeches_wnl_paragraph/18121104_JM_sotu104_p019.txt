with
a
view
to
that
vigorous
prosecution
of
the
war
to
which
our
national
faculty
are
adequate
,
the
attention
of
congress
will
be
particularly
drawn
to
the
insufficiency
of
existing
provision
for
filling
up
the
military
establishment
.
such
is
the
happy
condition
of
our
country
,
arising
from
the
facility
of
subsistence
and
the
high
wage
for
every
specie
of
occupation
,
that
notwithstanding
the
augmented
inducement
provided
at
the
last
session
,
a
partial
success
only
ha
attended
the
recruiting
service
.
the
deficiency
ha
been
necessarily
supplied
during
the
campaign
by
other
than
regular
troop
,
with
all
the
inconvenience
and
expense
incident
to
them
.
the
remedy
lie
in
establishing
more
favorably
for
the
private
soldier
the
proportion
between
his
recompense
and
the
term
of
his
enlistment
,
and
it
is
a
subject
which
can
not
too
soon
or
too
seriously
be
taken
into
consideration
.
