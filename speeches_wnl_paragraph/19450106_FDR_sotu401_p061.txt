our
over-all
strategy
ha
not
neglected
the
important
task
of
rendering
all
possible
aid
to
china
.
despite
almost
insuperable
difficulty
,
we
increased
this
aid
during
1944
.
at
present
our
aid
to
china
must
be
accomplished
by
air
transport-
there
is
no
other
way
.
by
the
end
of
1944
,
the
air
transport
command
wa
carrying
into
china
a
tonnage
of
supply
three
time
a
great
a
that
delivered
a
year
ago
,
and
much
more
,
each
month
,
than
the
burma
road
ever
delivered
at
it
peak
.
