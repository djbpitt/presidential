those
who
do
not
fear
any
disastrous
consequence
arising
from
the
continued
compulsory
coinage
of
silver
a
now
directed
by
law
,
and
who
suppose
that
the
addition
to
the
currency
of
the
country
intended
a
it
result
will
be
a
public
benefit
,
are
reminded
that
history
demonstrates
that
the
point
is
easily
reached
in
the
attempt
to
float
at
the
same
time
two
sort
of
money
of
different
excellence
when
the
better
will
cease
to
be
in
general
circulation
.
the
hoarding
of
gold
which
ha
already
taken
place
indicates
that
we
shall
not
escape
the
usual
experience
in
such
case
.
so
if
this
silver
coinage
be
continued
we
may
reasonably
expect
that
gold
and
it
equivalent
will
abandon
the
field
of
circulation
to
silver
alone
.
this
of
course
must
produce
a
severe
contraction
of
our
circulating
medium
,
instead
of
adding
to
it
.
