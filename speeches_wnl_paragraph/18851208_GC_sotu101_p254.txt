the
allurement
of
an
immense
number
of
office
and
place
exhibited
to
the
voter
of
the
land
,
and
the
promise
of
their
bestowal
in
recognition
of
partisan
activity
;
debauch
the
suffrage
and
rob
political
action
of
it
thoughtful
and
deliberative
character
.
the
evil
would
increase
with
the
multiplication
of
office
consequent
upon
our
extension
,
and
the
mania
for
office
holding
,
growing
from
it
indulgence
,
would
pervade
our
population
so
generally
that
patriotic
purpose
,
the
support
of
principle
,
the
desire
for
the
public
good
,
and
solicitude
for
the
nation
's
welfare
would
be
nearly
banished
from
the
activity
of
our
party
contest
and
cause
them
to
degenerate
into
ignoble
,
selfish
,
and
disgraceful
struggle
for
the
possession
of
office
and
public
place
.
