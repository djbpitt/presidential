we
of
the
republic
sensed
the
truth
that
democratic
government
ha
innate
capacity
to
protect
it
people
against
disaster
once
considered
inevitable
,
to
solve
problem
once
considered
unsolvable
.
we
would
not
admit
that
we
could
not
find
a
way
to
master
economic
epidemic
just
a
,
after
century
of
fatalistic
suffering
,
we
had
found
a
way
to
master
epidemic
of
disease
.
we
refused
to
leave
the
problem
of
our
common
welfare
to
be
solved
by
the
wind
of
chance
and
the
hurricane
of
disaster
.
