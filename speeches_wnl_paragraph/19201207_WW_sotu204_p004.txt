this
is
the
mission
upon
which
democracy
came
into
the
world
.
democracy
is
an
assertion
of
the
right
of
the
individual
to
live
and
to
be
treated
justly
a
against
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
any
combination
of
individual
to
make
law
which
will
overburden
him
or
which
will
destroy
his
equality
among
his
fellow
in
the
matter
of
right
or
privilege
;
and
i
think
we
all
realize
that
the
day
ha
come
when
democracy
is
being
put
upon
it
final
test
.
the
old
world
is
just
now
suffering
from
a
wanton
rejection
of
the
principle
of
democracy
and
a
substitution
of
the
principle
of
autocracy
a
asserted
in
the
name
,
but
without
the
authority
and
sanction
,
of
the
multitude
.
this
is
the
time
of
all
others
when
democracy
should
prove
it
purity
and
it
spiritual
power
to
prevail
.
it
is
surely
the
manifest
destiny
of
the
united
state
to
lead
in
the
attempt
to
make
this
spirit
prevail
.
