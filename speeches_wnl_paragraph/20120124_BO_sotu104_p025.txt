i
will
go
anywhere
in
the
world
to
open
new
market
for
american
product
.
and
i
will
not
stand
by
when
our
competitor
do
n't
play
by
the
rule
.
we
've
brought
trade
case
against
china
at
nearly
twice
the
rate
a
the
last
administration
,
and
it
's
made
a
difference
.
over
a
thousand
american
are
working
today
because
we
stopped
a
surge
in
chinese
tire
.
but
we
need
to
do
more
.
it
's
not
right
when
another
country
let
our
movie
,
music
,
and
software
be
pirated
.
it
's
not
fair
when
foreign
manufacturer
have
a
leg
up
on
ours
only
because
they
're
heavily
subsidized
.
