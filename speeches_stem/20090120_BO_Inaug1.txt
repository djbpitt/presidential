i
thank

for
hi
servic
to
our
nation
,
as
well
as
the
generos
and
cooper
he
ha
shown
throughout
thi
transit

forty-four
american
have
now
taken
the
presidenti
oath
.
the
word
have
been
spoken
dure
rise
tide
of
prosper
and
the
still
water
of
peac
.
yet
,
everi
so
often
the
oath
is
taken
amidst
gather
cloud
and
rage
storm
.
at
these
moment
,
america
ha
carri
on
not
simpli
becaus
of
the
skill
or
vision
of
those
in
high
offic
,
but
becaus
we
the
peopl
have
remain
faith
to
the
ideal
of
our
forbear
,
and
true
to
our
found
document
.
so
it
ha
been
.
so
it
must
be
with
thi
gener
of
american
.
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
crisi
is
now
well
understood
.
our
nation
is
at
war
,
against
a
far-reach
network
of
violenc
and
hatr
.
our
economi
is
badli
weaken
,
a
consequ
of
greed
and
irrespons
on
the
part
of
some
,
but
also
our
collect
failur
to
make
hard
choic
and
prepar
the
nation
for
a
new
age
.
home
have
been
lost
;
job
shed
;
busi
shutter
.
our
health
care
is
too
costli
;
our
school
fail
too
mani
;
and
each
day
bring
further
evid
that
the
way
we
use
energi
strengthen
our
adversari
and
threaten
our

.
these
are
the
indic
of
crisi
,
subject
to
data
and
statist
.
less
measur
but
no
less
profound
is
a
sap
of
confid
across
our
land—a
nag
fear
that
america
's
declin
is
inevit
,
and
that
the
next
gener
must
lower
it
sight
.
today
i
say
to
you
that
the
challeng
we
face
are
real
.
they
are
seriou
and
they
are
mani
.
they
will
not
be
met
easili
or
in
a
short
span
of
time
.
but
know
thi
,
america—they
will
be
met
.
on
thi
day
,
we
gather
becaus
we
have
chosen
hope
over
fear
,
uniti
of
purpos
over
conflict
and
discord
.
on
thi
day
,
we
come
to
proclaim
an
end
to
the
petti
grievanc
and
fals
promis
,
the
recrimin
and
worn
out
dogma
,
that
for
far
too
long
have
strangl
our
polit
.
we
remain
a
young
nation
,
but
in
the
word
of
scriptur
,
the
time
ha
come
to
set
asid
childish
thing
.
the
time
ha
come
to
reaffirm
our
endur
spirit
;
to
choos
our
better
histori
;
to
carri
forward
that
preciou
gift
,
that
nobl
idea
,
pass
on
from
gener
to
gener
:
the
god-given
promis
that
all
are
equal
,
all
are
free
,
and
all
deserv
a
chanc
to
pursu
their
full
measur
of
happi
.
in
reaffirm
the
great
of
our
nation
,
we
understand
that
great
is
never
a
given
.
it
must
be
earn
.
our
journey
ha
never
been
one
of
short-cut
or
settl
for
less
.
it
ha
not
been
the
path
for
the
faint-hearted—for
those
who
prefer
leisur
over
work
,
or
seek
onli
the
pleasur
of
rich
and
fame
.
rather
,
it
ha
been
the
risk-tak
,
the
doer
,
the
maker
of
things—som
celebr
but
more
often
men
and
women
obscur
in
their
labor
,
who
have
carri
us
up
the
long
,
rug
path
toward
prosper
and
freedom
.
for
us
,
they
pack
up
their
few
worldli
possess
and
travel
across
ocean
in
search
of
a
new
life
.
for
us
,
they
toil
in
sweatshop
and
settl
the
west
;
endur
the
lash
of
the
whip
and
plow
the
hard
earth
.
for
us
,
they
fought
and
die
,
in
place
like
concord
and
gettysburg
;
normandi
and
khe
sahn
.
time
and
again
these
men
and
women
struggl
and
sacrif
and
work
till
their
hand
were
raw
so
that
we
might
live
a
better
life
.
they
saw
america
as
bigger
than
the
sum
of
our
individu
ambit
;
greater
than
all
the
differ
of
birth
or
wealth
or
faction
.
thi
is
the
journey
we
continu
today
.
we
remain
the
most
prosper
,
power
nation
on
earth
.
our
worker
are
no
less
product
than
when
thi
crisi
began
.
our
mind
are
no
less
invent
,
our
good
and
servic
no
less
need
than
they
were
last
week
or
last

or
last

.
our
capac
remain
undiminish
.
but
our
time
of
stand
pat
,
of
protect
narrow
interest
and
put
off
unpleas
decisions—that
time
ha
sure
pass

start
today
,
we
must
pick
ourselv
up
,
dust
ourselv
off
,
and
begin
again
the
work
of
remak
america
.
for
everywher
we
look
,
there
is
work
to
be
done
.
the
state
of
the
economi
call
for
action
,
bold
and
swift
,
and
we
will
act—not
onli
to
creat
new
job
,
but
to
lay
a
new
foundat
for
growth
.
we
will
build
the
road
and
bridg
,
the
electr
grid
and
digit
line
that
feed
our
commerc
and
bind
us
togeth
.
we
will
restor
scienc
to
it
right
place
,
and
wield
technolog
's
wonder
to
rais
health
care
's
qualiti
and
lower
it
cost
.
we
will
har
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
the
soil
to
fuel
our
car
and
run
our
factori
.
and
we
will
transform
our
school
and
colleg
and
univers
to
meet
the
demand
of
a
new
age
.
all
thi
we
can
do
.
and
all
thi
we
will
do
.
now
,
there
are
some
who
question
the
scale
of
our
ambitions—who
suggest
that
our
system
can
not
toler
too
mani
big
plan
.
their
memori
are
short
.
for
they
have
forgotten
what
thi
countri
ha
alreadi
done
;
what
free
men
and
women
can
achiev
when
imagin
is
join
to
common
purpos
,
and
necess
to
courag
.
what
the
cynic
fail
to
understand
is
that
the
ground
ha
shift
beneath
them—that
the
stale
polit
argument
that
have
consum
us
for
so
long
no
longer
appli
.
the
question
we
ask
today
is
not
whether
our
govern
is
too
big
or
too
small
,
but
whether
it
works—wheth
it
help
famili
find
job
at
a
decent
wage
,
care
they
can
afford
,
a
retir
that
is
dignifi
.
where
the
answer
is
ye
,
we
intend
to
move
forward
.
where
the
answer
is
no
,
program
will
end
.
and
those
of
us
who
manag
the
public
's
dollar
will
be
held
to
account—to
spend
wise
,
reform
bad
habit
,
and
do
our
busi
in
the
light
of
day—becaus
onli
then
can
we
restor
the
vital
trust
between
a
peopl
and
their
govern
.
nor
is
the
question
befor
us
whether
the
market
is
a
forc
for
good
or
ill.
it
power
to
gener
wealth
and
expand
freedom
is
unmatch
,
but
thi
crisi
ha
remind
us
that
without
a
watch
eye
,
the
market
can
spin
out
of
control—and
that
a
nation
can
not
prosper
long
when
it
favor

the
prosper

the
success
of
our
economi
ha
alway
depend
not
just
on
the
size
of
our
gross
domest
product
,
but
on
the
reach
of
our
prosper
;
on
our
abil
to
extend
opportun
to
everi
will
heart—not
out
of
chariti
,
but
becaus
it
is
the
surest
rout
to
our
common
good
.
as
for
our
common
defens
,
we
reject
as
fals
the
choic
between
our
safeti
and
our
ideal
.
our
found
father
,
face
with
peril
we
can
scarc

draft
a

a

those

and
we

to

from

that

recal
that

and
commun
not

with

but
with

understood
that

not

nor

we

we

and
roll

we

for

we

to

that

you

stronger

we

believ
that

that

that
as

that

to

we

know
that
you

and
we

as
we
consid
the
road
that
unfold
befor

,
we
rememb
with
humbl
gratitud
those
brave
american
who
,
at
thi
veri
hour
,
patrol
far-off
desert
and
distant
mountain
.
they
have
someth
to
tell
us
today
,
just
as
the
fallen
hero
who
lie
in
arlington
whisper
through
the
age
.
we
honor
them
not
onli
becaus
they
are
guardian
of
our
liberti
,
but
becaus
they
embodi
the
spirit
of
servic
;
a
willing
to
find
mean
in
someth
greater
than
themselv
.
and
yet
,
at
thi
moment—a
moment
that
will
defin
a
generation—it
is
precis
thi
spirit
that
must
inhabit
us
all
.
for
as
much
as
govern
can
do
and
must
do
,
it
is
ultim
the
faith
and
determin
of
the
american
peopl
upon
which
thi
nation
reli
.
it
is
the
kind
to
take
in
a
stranger
when
the
leve
break
,
the
selfless
of
worker
who
would
rather
cut
their
hour
than
see
a
friend
lose
their
job
which
see
us
through
our
darkest
hour
.
it
is
the
firefight
's
courag
to
storm
a
stairway
fill
with
smoke
,
but
also
a
parent
's
willing
to
nurtur
a
child
,
that
final
decid
our
fate
.
our
challeng
may
be
new
.
the
instrument
with
which
we
meet
them
may
be
new
.
but
those
valu
upon
which
our
success
depends—hard
work
and
honesti
,
courag
and
fair
play
,
toler
and
curios
,
loyalti
and
patriotism—thes
thing
are
old
.
these
thing
are
true
.
they
have
been
the
quiet
forc
of
progress
throughout
our
histori
.
what
is
demand
then
is
a
return
to
these
truth
.
what
is
requir
of
us
now
is
a
new
era
of
responsibility—a
recognit
,
on
the
part
of
everi
american
,
that
we
have
duti
to
ourselv
,
our
nation
,
and
the
world
,
duti
that
we
do
not
grudgingli
accept
but
rather
seiz
gladli
,
firm
in
the
knowledg
that
there
is
noth
so
satisfi
to
the
spirit
,
so
defin
of
our
charact
,
than
give
our
all
to
a
difficult
task
.
thi
is
the
price
and
the
promis
of
citizenship
.
thi
is
the
sourc
of
our
confidence—th
knowledg
that
god
call
on
us
to
shape
an
uncertain
destini

thi
is
the
mean
of
our
liberti

our

men
and
women
and
children
of
everi
race
and
everi
faith
can
join
in
celebr
across

and
whi

whose
