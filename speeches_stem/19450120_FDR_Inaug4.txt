mr.
chief
justic
,
mr.
vice
presid
,
my
friend
:
you
will
understand
and
,
i
believ
,
agre
with
my
wish
that
the
form
of
thi
inaugur
be
simpl
and
it
word
brief
.
we
american
of
today
,
togeth
with
our
alli
,
are
pass
through
a
period
of
suprem
test
.
it
is
a
test
of
our
courage—of
our
resolve—of
our
wisdom—of
our
essenti
democraci
.
if
we
meet
that
test—success
and
honorably—w
shall
perform
a
servic
of
histor
import
which
men
and
women
and
children
will
honor
throughout
all
time
.
as
i
stand
here
today
,
have
taken
the
solemn
oath
of
offic
in
the
presenc
of
my
fellow
countrymen—in
the
presenc
of
our
god—i
know
that
it
is
america
's
purpos
that
we
shall
not
fail
.
in
the
day
and
the
year
that
are
to
come
,
we
shall
work
for
ajust
and
honor
peac
,
a
durabl
peac
,
as
today
we
work
and
fight
for
total
victori
in
war
.
we
can
and
we
will
achiev
such
a
peac
.
we
shall
strive
for
perfect
.
we
shall
not
achiev
it
immediately—but
we
still
shall
strive
.
we
may
make
mistakes—but
they
must
never
be
mistak
which
result
from
faint
of
heart
or
abandon
of
moral
principl
.
i
rememb
that
my
old
schoolmast
,
dr.
peabodi
,
said
in
day
that
seem
to
us
then
to
be
secur
and
untroubl
,
``
thing
in
life
will
not
alway
run
smoothli
.
sometim
we
will
be
rise
toward
the
heights—then
all
will
seem
to
revers
itself
and
start
downward
.
the
great
fact
to
rememb
is
that
the
trend
of
civil
itself
is
forev
upward
;
that
a
line
drawn
through
the
middl
of
the
peak
and
the
valley
of
the
centuri
alway
ha
an
upward
trend
.
''
our
constitut
of
1787
wa
not
a
perfect
instrument
;
it
is
not
perfect
yet
.
but
it
provid
a
firm
base
upon
which
all
manner
of
men
,
of
all
race
and
color
and
creed
,
could
build
our
solid
structur
of
democraci
.
today
,
in
thi
year
of
war
,
1945
,
we
have
learn
lessons—at
a
fear
cost—and
we
shall
profit
by
them
.
we
have
learn
that
we
can
not
live
alon
,
at
peac
;
that
our
own
well-b
is
depend
on
the
well-b
of
other
nation
,
far
away
.
we
have
learn
that
we
must
live
as
men
and
not
as
ostrich
,
nor
as
dog
in
the
manger
.
we
have
learn
to
be
citizen
of
the
world
,
member
of
the
human
commun
.
we
have
learn
the
simpl
truth
,
as
emerson
said
,
that
,
``
the
onli
way
to
have
a
friend
is
to
be
one
.
''
we
can
gain
no
last
peac
if
we
approach
it
with
suspicion
and
mistrust
or
with
fear
.
we
can
gain
it
onli
if
we
proceed
with
the
understand
and
the
confid
and
the
courag
which
flow
from
convict
.
the
almighti
god
ha
bless
our
land
in
mani
way
.
he
ha
given
our
peopl
stout
heart
and
strong
arm
with
which
to
strike
mighti
blow
for
freedom
and
truth
.
he
ha
given
to
our
countri
a
faith
which
ha
becom
the
hope
of
all
peopl
in
an
anguish
world
.
so
we
pray
to
him
now
for
the
vision
to
see
our
way
clearli
to
see
the
way
that
lead
to
a
better
life
for
ourselv
and
for
all
our
fellow
men—and
to
the
achiev
of
hi
will
to
peac
on
earth
.
