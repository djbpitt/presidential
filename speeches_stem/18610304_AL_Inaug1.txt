with
a
custom
as
old
as
the

itself
,
i
appear
befor
you
to
address
you
briefli
,
and
to
take
in
your
presenc
the
oath
prescrib
by
the
constitut
of
the
unit
state
to
be
taken
by
the
presid
``
befor

''
i
do
not
consid
it
necessari
at
present
for
me
to
discuss
those
matter
of
administr
about
which
there
is
no
special
anxieti
or
excit

apprehens
seem
to
exist
among
the
peopl
of
the
southern
state
that
by
the
access
of
a
republican
administr
their
properti
and
their
peac
and
person
secur
are
to
be
endang
.
there
ha
never
been

reason

for
such

.
inde
,
the
most
ampl
evid
to
the
contrari
ha
all
the
while
exist

been
open
to
their

.
it
is
found
in
nearli
all
the
publish
speech
of
him
who
now
address
you
.
i
do
but
quot
from
one
of
those
speech
when
i
declar
that
``
i
have
no
purpos
,
directli
or
indirectli
,
to
interfer
with
the
institut
of
slaveri
in

it
exist
.
i
behev
i
have
no
law
right
to
do
so
,
and
i
have
no
inclin
to
do
so
.
''
those
who
nomin
and
elect
me
did
so
with
full
knowledg
that
i
had
made
thi
and
mani
similar
declar
,
and
had
never
recant
them
.
and
,
more
than
thi
,
they
place
in
the
platform
for
my
accept
,
and
as
a
law
to
themselv
and
to
me
,
the
clear
and
emphat
resolut
which
i
now
read
:
resolv
,
that
the
mainten
inviol
of
the
right
of
the
state
,
and
especi
the
right
of
each
state
to
order
and
control
it
own
domest
institut
accord
to
it
own
judgment
exclus
,
is
essenti
to
that
balanc
of
power
on
which
the
perfect
and
endur
of
our
polit
fabric
depend
,
and
we
denounc
the
lawless
invas
by
arm
forc
of
the
soil
of
ani
state
or
territori
,
no
matter
under
what
pretext
,
as
among
the
gravest
of
crime
.
i
now
reiter
these
sentiment
;
and
,
in
do
so
,
i
onli
press
upon
the
public
attent
the
most
conclus
evid
of
which
the
case
is
suscept
,
that
the
properti
,
peac
,
and
secur
of
no
section
are
to
be
in
ani
wise
endang
by
the
now
incom
administr
.
i
add
,
too
,
that
all
the
protect
which
,
consist
with
the
constitut
and
the
law
,
can
be
given
,
will
be
cheer
given
to
all
the
state
when
law
demand
,
for
whatev
cause—a
cheer
to
one
section
as
to
anoth
.
there
is
much
controversi
about
the
deliv
up
of
fugit
from
servic
or
labor
.
the
claus
i
now
read
is
as
plainli
written
in
the
constitut
as
ani
other
of
it
provis
:
no
person
held
to
servic
or
labor
in
one
state
,
under
the
law
thereof
,
escap
into
anoth
,
shall
in
consequ
of
ani
law
or
regul
therein
be
discharg
from
such
servic
or
labor
,
but
shall
be
deliv
up
on
claim
of
the
parti
to
whom
such
servic
or
labor
may
be
due
.
it
is
scarc
question
that
thi
provis
wa
intend
by
those
who
made
it
for
the
reclaim
of
what
we
call
fugit
slave
;
and
the
intent
of
the
lawgiv
is
the
law
.
all
member
of
congress
swear
their
support
to
the
whole
constitution—to
thi
provis
as
much
as
to
ani
other
.
to
the
proposit
,
then
,
that
slave
whose
case
come
within
the
term
of
thi
claus
``
shall
be
deliv
up
,
''
their
oath
are
unanim
.
now
,
if
they
would
make
the
effort
in
good
temper
,
could
they
not
with
nearli
equal
unanim
frame
and
pass
a
law
by
mean
of
which
to
keep
good
that
unanim
oath
?
there
is
some
differ
of
opinion
whether
thi
claus
should
be
enforc
by
nation
or
by
state
author
;
but
sure
that
differ
is
not
a
veri
materi
one
.
if
the
slave
is
to
be
surrend
,
it
can
be
of
but
littl
consequ
to
him
or
to
other
by
which
author
it
is
done
.
and
should
anyon
in
ani
case
be
content
that
hi
oath
shall
go
unkept
on
a
mere
unsubstanti
controversi
as
to
how
it
shall
be
kept
?
again
,
in
ani
law
upon
thi
subject
,
ought
not
all
the
safeguard
of
liberti
known
in
civil
and
human
jurisprud
to
be
introduc
,
so
that
a
free
man
be
not
,
in
ani
case
,
surrend
as
a
slave
?
and
might
it
not
be
well
at
the
same
time
to
provid
by
law
for
the
enforc
of
that
claus
in
the
constitut
which
guarante
that
``
the
citizen
of
each
state
shall
be
entitl
to
all
privileg
and
immun
of
citizen
in
the
sever
state
.
''
i
take
the
offici
oath
to-day
with
no
mental
reserv

and
with
no
purpos
to
constru
the

and
while
i
do
not
choos
now
to
specifi
particular

of

as
proper
to
be

i
do
suggest
that
it
will
be
much
safer
for

both
in

to

yet
,
with
all
thi

i
now
enter
upon
the

task
for
the
brief
constitut

of

peculiar
difficulti

i
hold
that
,
in

the

perpetu
is
impli

if
not
express

in
the
fundament

of

it
is
safe
to
assert
that
no

continu

execut
all

will
endur
forever—it
be
imposs
to
destroy
it
except
by
some
action
not
provid

in
the
instrument
itself
.
again
,
if
the
unit
state
be
not
a
govern
proper
,
but
an
associ

state
in

natur
of

,
can
it

as
a

,
be
peaceabl
unmad

one

may
violat
it—break
it
,
so
to
speak
;
but
doe
it
not
requir
all
to

rescind
it
?
descend
from
these
gener
principl
,
we
find
the
proposit
that
,
in
legal
contempl
the
union
is
perpetu
confirm
by
the
histori
of
the
union
itself
.
the
union
is
much
older
than
the
constitut
.
it
wa
form
,
in
fact
,
by
the
articl
of
associ
in
1774
.
it
wa
matur
and
continu
by
the
declar
of
independ
in
1776
.
it
wa
further
matur
,
and
the
faith
of
all
the
then
thirteen
state
expressli
plight
and
engag
that
it
should
be
perpetu
,
by
the
articl
of
confeder
in
1778
.
and
,
final
,
in
1787
one
of
the
declar
object
for
ordain
and
establish
the
constitut
wa
``
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
.
''
but
if
the
destruct
of
the
union
by
one
or
by
a
part
onli
of
the
state
be
law
possibl
,
the
union
is
less
perfect
than
befor
the
constitut
,
have
lost
the
vital
element
of
perpetu
.
it
follow
from
these
view
that
no
state
upon
it
own
mere
motion
can
law
get
out
of
the
union
;
that
resolv
and
ordin
to
that
effect
are
legal
void
;
and
that
act
of
violenc
,
within
ani
state
or

against
the
author
of

are
insurrectionari

i
therefor
consid
that
,
in

of

the

the

is
unbroken

and
to
the
extent
of
my
abil

i
shall
perform
it
so
far

the
american

shall

i
trust
thi

onli

in

thi
there

there
shall
be
none

plainli
,
the
