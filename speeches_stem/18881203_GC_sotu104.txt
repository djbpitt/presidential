remain

while

these

can
be
much
emphas

thi
expect

be
answer
by

our

among

our

perfect
devot
,
abov
all

thi
devot
will
lead
us
to

the
preserv

of
such
import
under

the

that

and
sure
no

who
ha
taken
upon

the

find

i
am
thoroughli
convinc
that
our
gener
pension
law
should
be
revis
and
adjust
to
meet
as
far
as
possibl
,
in
the
light
of
our
experi

all
meritori
case
.
the
fact
that
102

paid
can
not
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
made
consist
with
justic
to
the
pension
or
to
the
govern
;
and
the
numer
privat

,
predic
upon

imperfect

law
,
while
they
increas
in

case
exist
inequ
and
injustic
,
lend
addit
forc
to
the
recommend
for
a
revis
of
the
gener
law
on
thi
subject
.
the

the

rather

if

if

there
is
danger
that
