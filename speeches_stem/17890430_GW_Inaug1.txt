fellow
citizen
of
the
senat
and
the
hous
of
repres
:
among
the
vicissitud
incid
to
life
,
no
event
could
have
fill
me
with
greater
anxieti
than
that
of
which
the
notif
wa
transmit
by
your
order
,
and
receiv
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
present
month
.
on
the
one
hand
,
i
wa
summon
by
my
countri
,
whose
voic
i
can
never
hear
but
with
vener
and
love
,
from
a
retreat
which
i
had
chosen
with
the
fondest
predilect
,
and
,
in
my
flatter
hope
,
with
an
immut
decis
,
as
the
asylum
of
my
declin
year
:
a
retreat
which
wa
render
everi
day
more
necessari
as
well
as
more
dear
to
me
,
by
the
addit
of
habit
to
inclin
,
and
of
frequent
interrupt
in
my
health
to
the
gradual
wast
commit
on
it
by
time
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
magnitud
and
difficulti
of
the
trust
to
which
the
voic
of
my
countri
call
me
,
be
suffici
to
awaken
in
the
wisest
and
most
experienc
of
her
citizen
,
a
distrust
scrutini
into
hi
qualif
,
could
not
but
overwhelm
with
dispond
,
one
,
who
,
inherit
inferior
endow
from
natur
and
unpractis
in
the
duti
of
civil
administr
,
ought
to
be
peculiarli
consciou
of
hi
own
defic
.
in
thi
conflict
of
emot
,
all
i
dare
aver
,
is
,
that
it
ha
been
my
faith
studi
to
collect
my
duti
from
a
just
appreci
of
everi
circumst
,
by
which
it
might
be
affect
.
all
i
dare
hope
,
is
,
that
,
if
in
execut
thi
task
i
have
been
too
much
sway
by
a
grate
remembr
of
former
instanc
,
or
by
an
affection
sensibl
to
thi
transcend
proof
,
of
the
confid
of
my
fellow-citizen
;
and
have
thenc
too
littl
consult
my
incapac
as
well
as
disinclin
for
the
weighti
and
untri
care
befor
me
;
my
error
will
be
palliat
by
the
motiv
which
misl
me
,
and
it
consequ
be
judg
by
my
countri
,
with
some
share
of
the
partial
in
which
they
origin

such
be
the
impress
under
which
i
have
,
in
obedi
to
the
public
summon
,
repair
to
the
present
station
;
it
would
be
peculiarli
improp
to
omit
in
thi
first

,
my
fervent
supplic
to
that
almighti

who

the

will
acquit
me
from

farther
than

in

an
