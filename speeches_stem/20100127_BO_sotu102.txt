they

in

midst
of

and
depress
,
at
moment
of
great

and
great
struggl

it

look
back
on
these
moment
and
assum
that
our

that
america

,
america
prevail
becaus
we
chose
to
move
forward
as
one
nation
,
as
one
peopl
.
again
,
we
are
test
.
and
again
,
we
must
answer
histori
's
call
.
one
year
ago
,
i
took
offic
amid
two
war
,
an
economi
rock
by
a
sever
recess
,
a
financi
system
on
the
verg
of
collaps
,
and
a
govern
deepli
in
debt
.
expert
from
across
the
polit
spectrum
warn
that
if
we
did
not
act
,
we
might
face
a
second
depress
.
so
we
act
,
immedi
and
aggress
.
and
1
year
later
,
the
worst
of
the
storm
ha
pass
.
but
the
devast
remain
.
one
in
10
american
still
can
not
find
work
.
mani
busi
have
shutter
.
home
valu
have
declin
.
small
town
and
rural
commun
have
been
hit
especi
hard
.
and
for
those
who
'd
alreadi
known
poverti
,
life
's
becom
that
much
harder
.
thi
recess
ha
also
compound
the
burden
that
america
's
famili
have
been
deal
with
for
decad
:
the
burden
of
work
harder
and
longer
for
less
,
of
be
unabl
to
save
enough
to
retir
or
help
kid
with
colleg
.
so
i
know
the
anxieti
that
are
out
there
right
now
.
they
're
not
new
.
these
struggl
are
the
reason
i
ran
for
presid
.
these
struggl
are
what
i
've
wit
for
year
,
in
place
like
elkhart
,
indiana
;
galesburg
,
illinoi
.
i
hear
about
them
in
the
letter
that
i
read
each
night
.
the
toughest
to
read
are
those
written
by
children
ask
whi
they
have
to
move
from
their
home
,
ask
when
their
mom
or
dad
will
be
abl
to
go
back
to
work
.
for
these
american
and
so
mani
other
,
chang
ha
not
come
fast
enough
.
some
are
frustrat
,
some
are
angri
.
they
do
n't
understand
whi
it
seem
like
bad
behavior
on
wall
street
is
reward
,
but
hard
work
on
main
street
is
n't
,
or
whi
washington
ha
been
unabl
or
unwil
to
solv
ani
of
our
problem
.
they
're
tire
of
the
partisanship
and
the
shout
and
the
petti
.
they
know
we
ca
n't
afford
it
.
not
now
.
so
we
face
big
and
difficult
challeng
.
and
what
the
american
peopl
hope
,
what
they
deserv
,
is
for
all
of
us
,
democrat
and
republican
,
to
work
through
our
differ
,
to
overcom
the
numb
weight
of
our
polit
.
for
while
the
peopl
who
sent
us
here
have
differ
background
,
differ
stori
,
differ
belief
,
the
anxieti
they
face
are
the
same
.
the
aspir
they
hold
are
share
:
a
job
that
pay
the
bill
;
a
chanc
to
get
ahead
;
most
of
all
,
the
abil
to
give
their
children
a
better
life
.
and
you
know
what
els
they
share
?
they
share
a
stubborn
resili
in
the
face
of
advers
.
after
one
of
the
most
difficult
year
in
our
histori
,
they
remain
busi
build
car
and
teach
kid
,
start
busi
and
go
back
to
school
.
they'r
coach
littl
leagu
and
help
their
neighbor
.
one
woman
wrote
to
me
and
said
,
``
we
are
strain
but
hope
,
struggl
but
encourag
.
''
it
's
becaus
of
thi
spirit
,
thi
great
decenc
and
great
strength
,
that
i
have
never
been
more
hope
about
america
's
futur
than
i
am
tonight
.
despit
our
hardship
,
our
union
is
strong
.
we
do
not
give
up
.
we
do
not
quit
.
we
do
not
allow
fear
or
divis
to
break
our
spirit
.
in
thi
new
decad
,
it
's
time
the
american
peopl
get
a
govern
that
match
their
decenc
,
that
embodi
their
strength
.
and
tonight
i
'd
like
to
talk
about
how
togeth
we
can
deliv
on
that
promis
.
it
begin
with
our
economi
.
our
most
urgent
task
upon
take
offic
wa
to
shore
up
the
same
bank
that
help
caus
thi
crisi
.
it
wa
not
easi
to
do
.
and
if
there
's
one
thing
that
ha
unifi
democrat
and
republican
and
everybodi
in
between
,
it
's
that
we
all
hate
the
bank
bailout
.
i
hate
it
.
i
hate
it
;
you
hate
it
.
it
wa
about
as
popular
as
a
root
canal
.
but
when
i
ran
for
presid
,
i
promis
i
would
n't
just
do
what
wa
popular
;
i
would
do
what
wa
necessari
.
and
if
we
had
allow
the
meltdown
of
the
financi
system
,
unemploy
might
be
doubl
what
it
is
today
.
more
busi
would
certainli
have
close
.
more
home
would
have
sure
been
lost
.
so
i
support
the
last
administr
's
effort
to
creat
the
financi
rescu
program
.
and
when
we
took
that
program
over
,
we
made
it
more
transpar
and
more
account
.
and
as
a
result
,
the
market
are
now
stabil
,
and
we
've
recov
most
of
the
money
we
spent
on
the
banks—most
but
not
all
.
to
recov
the
rest
,
i
've
propos
a
fee
on
the
biggest
bank
.
now
,
i
know
wall
street
is
n't
keen
on
thi
idea
.
but
if
these
firm
can
afford
to
hand
out
big
bonus
again
,
they
can
afford
a
modest
fee
to
pay
back
the
taxpay
who
rescu
them
in
their
time
of
need
.
now
,
as
we
stabil
the
financi
system
,
we
also
took
step
to
get
our
economi
grow
again
,
save
as
mani
job
as
possibl
,
and
help
american
who
had
becom
unemploy
.
that
's
whi
we
extend
or
increas
unemploy
benefit
for
more
than
18
million
american
,
made
health
insur
65
percent
cheaper
for
famili
who
get
their
coverag
through
cobra
,
and
pass
25
differ
tax
cut
.
now
,
let
me
repeat
:
we
cut
tax
.
we
cut
tax
for
95
percent
of
work
famili
.
we
cut
tax
for
small
busi
.
we
cut
tax
for
first-tim
home
buyer
.
we
cut
tax
for
parent
tri
to
care
for
their
children
.
we
cut
tax
for
8
million
american
pay
for
colleg
.
i
thought
i
'd
get
some
applaus
on
that
one
.
as
a
result
,
million
of
american
had
more
to
spend
on
ga
and
food
and
other
necess
,
all
of
which
help
busi
keep
more
worker
.
and
we
have
n't
rais
incom
tax
by
a
singl
dime
on
a
singl
person—not
a
singl
dime
.
now
,
becaus
of
the
step
we
took
,
there
are
about
2
million
american
work
right
now
who
would
otherwis
be
unemploy
.
two
hundr
thousand
work
in
construct
and
clean
energi
.
three
hundr
thousand
are
teacher
and
other
educ
worker
.
ten
of
thousand
are
cop
,
firefight
,
correct
offic
,
first-respond
.
and
we
're
on
track
to
add
anoth
1½
million
job
to
thi
total
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
the
plan
that
ha
made
all
of
thi
possibl
,
from
the
tax
cut
to
the
job
,
is
the
recoveri
act
.
that
's
right
,
the
recoveri
act
,
also
known
as
the
stimulu
bill
.
economist
on
the
left
and
the
right
say
thi
bill
ha
help
save
job
and
avert
disast
.
but
you
do
n't
have
to
take
their
word
for
it
.
talk
to
the
small
busi
in
phoenix
that
will
tripl
it
workforc
becaus
of
the
recoveri
act
.
talk
to
the
window
manufactur
in
philadelphia
who
said
he
use
to
be
skeptic
about
the
recoveri
act
,
until
he
had
to
add
two
more
work
shift
just
becaus
of
the
busi
it
creat
.
talk
to
the
singl
teacher
rais
two
kid
who
wa
told
by
her
princip
in
the
last
week
of
school
that
becaus
of
the
recoveri
act
,
she
would
n't
be
laid
off
after
all
.
there
are
stori
like
thi
all
across
america
.
and
after
2
year
of
recess
,
the
economi
is
grow
again
.
retir
fund
have
start
to
gain
back
some
of
their
valu
.
busi
are
begin
to
invest
again
,
and
slowli
some
are
start
to
hire
again
.
but
i
realiz
that
for
everi
success
stori
,
there
are
other
stori
,
of
men
and
women
who
wake
up
with
the
anguish
of
not
know
where
their
next
paycheck
will
come
from
,
who
send
out
resum
week
after
week
and
hear
noth
in
respons
.
that
is
whi
job
must
be
our
number-on
focu
in
2010
,
and
that
's
whi
i
'm
call
for
a
new
job
bill
tonight
.
now
,
the
true
engin
of
job
creation
in
thi
countri
will
alway
be
america
's
busi
.
i
agre
,
absolut
.
but
govern
can
creat
the
condit
necessari
for
busi
to
expand
and
hire
more
worker
.
we
should
start
where
most
new
job
do
,
in
small
busi
,
compani
that
begin
when
an
entrepreneur
take
a
chanc
on
a
dream
or
a
worker
decid
it
's
time
she
becam
her
own
boss
.
through
sheer
grit
and
determin
,
these
compani
have
weather
the
recess
,
and
they
're
readi
to
grow
.
but
when
you
talk
to
small-busi
owner
in
place
like
allentown
,
pennsylvania
,
or
elyria
,
ohio
,
you
find
out
that
even
though
bank
on
wall
street
are
lend
again
,
they
're
mostli
lend
to
bigger
compani
.
financ
remain
difficult
for
small-busi
owner
across
the
countri
,
even
those
that
are
make
a
profit
.
so
tonight
i
'm
propos
that
we
take
$
30
billion
of
the
money
wall
street
bank
have
repaid
and
use
it
to
help
commun
bank
give
small
busi
the
credit
they
need
to
stay
afloat
.
i
'm
also
propos
a
new
small
busi
tax
credit
,
one
that
will
go
to
over
1
million
small
busi
who
hire
new
worker
or
rais
wage
.
while
we
're
at
it
,
let
's
also
elimin
all
capit
gain
tax
on
small-busi
invest
and
provid
a
tax
incent
for
all
larg
busi
and
all
small
busi
to
invest
in
new
plant
and
equip
.
next
,
we
can
put
american
to
work
today
build
the
infrastructur
of
tomorrow
.
from
the
first
railroad
to
the
interst
highway
system
,
our
nation
ha
alway
been
built
to
compet
.
there
's
no
reason
europ
or
china
should
have
the
fastest
train
or
the
new
factori
that
manufactur
clean
energi
product
.
tomorrow
i
'll
visit
tampa
,
florida
,
where
worker
will
soon
break
ground
on
a
new
high-spe
railroad
fund
by
the
recoveri
act
.
there
are
project
like
that
all
across
thi
countri
that
will
creat
job
and
help
move
our
nation
's
good
,
servic
,
and
inform
.
we
should
put
more
american
to
work
build
clean
energi
facil
and
give
rebat
to
american
who
make
their
home
more
energi
effici
,
which
support
clean
energi
job
.
and
to
encourag
these
and
other
busi
to
stay
within
our
border
,
it
is
time
to
final
slash
the
tax
break
for
compani
that
ship
our
job
oversea
and
give
those
tax
break
to
compani
that
creat
job
right
here
in
the
unit
state
of
america
.
now
,
the
hous
ha
pass
a
job
bill
that
includ
some
of
these
step
.
as
the
first
order
of
busi
thi
year
,
i
urg
the
senat
to
do
the
same
,
and
i
know
they
will
.
they
will
.
peopl
are
out
of
work
.
they
're
hurt
.
they
need
our
help
.
and
i
want
a
job
bill
on
my
desk
without
delay
.
but
the
truth
is
,
these
step
wo
n't
make
up
for
the
7
million
job
that
we
've
lost
over
the
last
2
year
.
the
onli
way
to
move
to
full
employ
is
to
lay
a
new
foundat
for
long-term
econom
growth
and
final
address
the
problem
that
america
's
famili
have
confront
for
year
.
we
ca
n't
afford
anoth
so-cal
econom
``
expans
''
like
the
one
from
the
last
decad
,
what
some
call
the
``
lost
decad
,
''
where
job
grew
more
slowli
than
dure
ani
prior
expans
,
where
the
incom
of
the
averag
american
household
declin
while
the
cost
of
health
care
and
tuition
reach
record
high
,
where
prosper
wa
built
on
a
hous
bubbl
and
financi
specul
.
from
the
day
i
took
offic
,
i
've
been
told
that
address
our
larger
challeng
is
too
ambiti
;
such
an
effort
would
be
too
contenti
.
i
've
been
told
that
our
polit
system
is
too
gridlock
and
that
we
should
just
put
thing
on
hold
for
a
while
.
for
those
who
make
these
claim
,
i
have
one
simpl
question
:
how
long
should
we
wait
?
how
long
should
america
put
it
futur
on
hold
?
you
see
,
washington
ha
been
tell
us
to
wait
for
decad
,
even
as
the
problem
have
grown
wors
.
meanwhil
,
china
's
not
wait
to
revamp
it
economi
.
germani
's
not
wait
.
india
's
not
wait
.
these
nation
are—they
're
not
stand
still
.
these
nation
are
n't
play
for
second
place
.
they
're
put
more
emphasi
on
math
and
scienc
.
they
're
rebuild
their
infrastructur
.
they
're
make
seriou
invest
in
clean
energi
becaus
they
want
those
job
.
well
,
i
do
not
accept
second
place
for
the
unit
state
of
america
.
as
hard
as
it
may
be
,
as
uncomfort
and
contenti
as
the
debat
may
becom
,
it
's
time
to
get
seriou
about
fix
the
problem
that
are
hamper
our
growth
.
now
,
one
place
to
start
is
seriou
financi
reform
.
look
,
i
am
not
interest
in
punish
bank
.
i
'm
interest
in
protect
our
economi
.
a
strong
,
healthi
financi
market
make
it
possibl
for
busi
to
access
credit
and
creat
new
job
.
it
channel
the
save
of
famili
into
invest
that
rais
incom
.
but
that
can
onli
happen
if
we
guard
against
the
same
reckless
that
nearli
brought
down
our
entir
economi
.
we
need
to
make
sure
consum
and
middl
class
famili
have
the
inform
they
need
to
make
financi
decis
.
we
ca
n't
allow
financi
institut
,
includ
those
that
take
your
deposit
,
to
take
risk
that
threaten
the
whole
economi
.
now
,
the
hous
ha
alreadi
pass
financi
reform
with
mani
of
these
chang
,
and
the
lobbyist
are
tri
to
kill
it
.
but
we
can
not
let
them
win
thi
fight
.
and
if
the
bill
that
end
up
on
my
desk
doe
not
meet
the
test
of
real
reform
,
i
will
send
it
back
until
we
get
it
right
.
we
've
got
to
get
it
right
.
next
,
we
need
to
encourag
american
innov
.
last
year
,
we
made
the
largest
invest
in
basic
research
fund
in
histori
,
an
invest
that
could
lead
to
the
world'
cheapest
solar
cell
or
treatment
that
kill
cancer
cell
but
leav
healthi
one
untouch
.
and
no
area
is
more
ripe
for
such
innov
than
energi
.
you
can
see
the
result
of
last
year
's
invest
in
clean
energi
in
the
north
carolina
compani
that
will
creat
1,200
job
nationwid
help
to
make
advanc
batteri
or
in
the
california
busi
that
will
put
a
thousand
peopl
to
work
make
solar
panel
.
but
to
creat
more
of
these
clean
energi
job
,
we
need
more
product
,
more
effici
,
more
incent
.
and
that
mean
build
a
new
gener
of
safe
,
clean
nuclear
powerpl
in
thi
countri
.
it
mean
make
tough
decis
about
open
new
offshor
area
for
oil
and
ga
develop
.
it
mean
continu
invest
in
advanc
biofuel
and
clean
coal
technolog
.
and
,
ye
,
it
mean
pass
a
comprehens
energi
and
climat
bill
with
incent
that
will
final
make
clean
energi
the
profit
kind
of
energi
in
america
.
now
,
i
am
grate
to
the
hous
for
pass
such
a
bill
last
year
.
and
thi
year
,
i
'm
eager
to
help
advanc
the
bipartisan
effort
in
the
senat
.
i
know
there
have
been
question
about
whether
we
can
afford
such
chang
in
a
tough
economi
.
i
know
that
there
are
those
who
disagre
with
the
overwhelm
scientif
evid
on
climat
chang
.
but
here
's
the
thing
:
even
if
you
doubt
the
evid
,
provid
incent
for
energi
effici
and
clean
energi
are
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
futur
,
becaus
the
nation
that
lead
the
clean
energi
economi
will
be
the
nation
that
lead
the
global
economi
.
and
america
must
be
that
nation
.
third
,
we
need
to
export
more
of
our
good
,
becaus
the
more
product
we
make
and
sell
to
other
countri
,
the
more
job
we
support
right
here
in
america
.
so
tonight
we
set
a
new
goal
:
we
will
doubl
our
export
over
the
next
5
year
,
an
increas
that
will
support
2
million
job
in
america
.
to
help
meet
thi
goal
,
we
're
launch
a
nation
export
initi
that
will
help
farmer
and
small
busi
increas
their
export
and
reform
export
control
consist
with
nation
secur
.
we
have
to
seek
new
market
aggress
,
just
as
our
competitor
are
.
if
america
sit
on
the
sidelin
while
other
nation
sign
trade
deal
,
we
will
lose
the
chanc
to
creat
job
on
our
shore
.
but
realiz
those
benefit
also
mean
enforc
those
agreement
so
our
trade
partner
play
by
the
rule
.
and
that
's
whi
we
'll
continu
to
shape
a
doha
trade
agreement
that
open
global
market
and
whi
we
will
strengthen
our
trade
relat
in
asia
and
with
key
partner
like
south
korea
and
panama
and
colombia
.
fourth
,
we
need
to
invest
in
the
skill
and
educ
of
our
peopl
.
now
,
thi
year
,
we
've
broken
through
the
stalem
between
left
and
right
by
launch
a
nation
competit
to
improv
our
school
.
and
the
idea
here
is
simpl
:
instead
of
reward
failur
,
we
onli
reward
success
.
instead
of
fund
the
statu
quo
,
we
onli
invest
in
reform
,
reform
that
rais
student
achiev
,
inspir
student
to
excel
in
math
and
scienc
,
and
turn
around
fail
school
that
steal
the
futur
of
too
mani
young
american
,
from
rural
commun
to
the
inner
citi
.
in
the
21st
centuri
,
the
best
antipoverti
program
around
is
a
world-class
educ
.
and
in
thi
countri
,
the
success
of
our
children
can
not
depend
more
on
where
they
live
than
on
their
potenti
.
when
we
renew
the
elementari
and
secondari
educ
act
,
we
will
work
with
congress
to
expand
these
reform
to
all
50
state
.
still
,
in
thi
economi
,
a
high
school
diploma
no
longer
guarante
a
good
job
.
that
's
whi
i
urg
the
senat
to
follow
the
hous
and
pass
a
bill
that
will
revit
our
commun
colleg
,
which
are
a
career
pathway
to
the
children
of
so
mani
work
famili
.
to
make
colleg
more
afford
,
thi
bill
will
final
end
the
unwarr
taxpay
subsidi
that
go
to
bank
for
student
loan
.
instead
,
let
's
take
that
money
and
give
famili
a
$
10,000
tax
credit
for
4
year
of
colleg
and
increas
pell
grant
.
and
let'
tell
anoth
1
million
student
that
when
they
graduat
,
they
will
be
requir
to
pay
onli
10
percent
of
their
incom
on
student
loan
and
all
of
their
debt
will
be
forgiven
after
20
years—and
forgiven
after
10
year
if
they
choos
a
career
in
public
servic
,
becaus
in
the
unit
state
of
america
,
no
one
should
go
broke
becaus
they
chose
to
go
to
colleg
.
and
by
the
way
,
it
's
time
for
colleg
and
univers
to
get
seriou
about
cut
their
own
cost
,
becaus
they
too
have
a
respons
to
help
solv
thi
problem
.
now
,
the
price
of
colleg
tuition
is
just
one
of
the
burden
face
the
middl
class
.
that
's
whi
last
year
,
i
ask
vice
presid
biden
to
chair
a
task
forc
on
middl
class
famili
.
that
's
whi
we
're
nearli
doubl
the
child
care
tax
credit
and
make
it
easier
to
save
for
retir
by
give
access
to
everi
worker
a
retir
account
and
expand
the
tax
credit
for
those
who
start
a
nest
egg
.
that
's
whi
we
're
work
to
lift
the
valu
of
a
famili
's
singl
largest
invest
,
their
home
.
the
step
we
took
last
year
to
shore
up
the
hous
market
have
allow
million
of
american
to
take
out
new
loan
and
save
an
averag
of
$
1,500
on
mortgag
payment
.
thi
year
,
we
will
step
up
refinanc
so
that
homeown
can
move
into
more
afford
mortgag
.
and
it
is
precis
to
reliev
the
burden
on
middl
class
famili
that
we
still
need
health
insur
reform
.
ye
,
we
do
.
now
,
let
's
clear
a
few
thing
up
.
i
did
n't
choos
to
tackl
thi
issu
to
get
some
legisl
victori
under
my
belt
.
and
by
now
it
should
be
fairli
obviou
that
i
didn't
take
on
health
care
becaus
it
wa
good
polit
.
i
took
on
health
care
becaus
of
the
stori
i
've
heard
from
american
with
preexist
condit
whose
live
depend
on
get
coverag
,
patient
who
've
been
deni
coverag
,
famili
,
even
those
with
insur
,
who
are
just
one
ill
away
from
financi
ruin
.
after
nearli
a
centuri
of
trying—democrat
administr
,
republican
administrations—w
are
closer
than
ever
to
bring
more
secur
to
the
live
of
so
mani
american
.
the
approach
we
've
taken
would
protect
everi
american
from
the
worst
practic
of
the
insur
industri
.
it
would
give
small
busi
and
uninsur
american
a
chanc
to
choos
an
afford
health
care
plan
in
a
competit
market
.
it
would
requir
everi
insur
plan
to
cover
prevent
care
.
and
by
the
way
,
i
want
to
acknowledg
our
first
ladi
,
michel
obama
,
who
thi
year
is
creat
a
nation
movement
to
tackl
the
epidem
of
childhood
obes
and
make
kid
healthier
.
thank
you
,
honey
.
she
get
embarrass
.
our
approach
would
preserv
the
right
of
american
who
have
insur
to
keep
their
doctor
and
their
plan
.
it
would
reduc
cost
and
premium
for
million
of
famili
and
busi
.
and
accord
to
the
congression
budget
offic
,
the
independ
organ
that
both
parti
have
cite
as
the
offici
scorekeep
for
congress
,
our
approach
would
bring
down
the
deficit
by
as
much
as
$
1
trillion
over
the
next
two
decad
.
still
,
thi
is
a
complex
issu
,
and
the
longer
it
wa
debat
,
the
more
skeptic
peopl
becam
.
i
take
my
share
of
the
blame
for
not
explain
it
more
clearli
to
the
american
peopl
.
and
i
know
that
with
all
the
lobbi
and
horse-trad
,
the
process
left
most
american
wonder
,
``
what
's
in
it
for
me
?
''
but
i
also
know
thi
problem
is
not
go
away
.
by
the
time
i
'm
finish
speak
tonight
,
more
american
will
have
lost
their
health
insur
.
million
will
lose
it
thi
year
.
our
deficit
will
grow
.
premium
will
go
up
.
patient
will
be
deni
the
care
they
need
.
small-busi
owner
will
continu
to
drop
coverag
altogeth
.
i
will
not
walk
away
from
these
american
,
and
neither
should
the
peopl
in
thi
chamber
.
so
,
as
temperatur
cool
,
i
want
everyon
to
take
anoth
look
at
the
plan
we'v
propos
.
there
's
a
reason
whi
mani
doctor
,
nurs
,
and
health
care
expert
who
know
our
system
best
consid
thi
approach
a
vast
improv
over
the
statu
quo
.
but
if
anyon
from
either
parti
ha
a
better
approach
that
will
bring
down
premium
,
bring
down
the
deficit
,
cover
the
uninsur
,
strengthen
medicar
for
senior
,
and
stop
insur
compani
abus
,
let
me
know
.
let
me
know
.
let
me
know
.
i
'm
eager
to
see
it
.
here
's
what
i
ask
congress
,
though
:
do
n't
walk
away
from
reform
.
not
now
.
not
when
we
are
so
close
.
let
us
find
a
way
to
come
togeth
and
finish
the
job
for
the
american
peopl
.
let
's
get
it
done
.
let
's
get
it
done
.
now
,
even
as
health
care
reform
would
reduc
our
deficit
,
it
's
not
enough
to
dig
us
out
of
a
massiv
fiscal
hole
in
which
we
find
ourselv
.
it
's
a
challeng
that
make
all
other
that
much
harder
to
solv
and
one
that
's
been
subject
to
a
lot
of
polit
postur
.
so
let
me
start
the
discuss
of
govern
spend
by
set
the
record
straight
.
at
the
begin
of
the
last
decad
,
the
year
2000
,
america
had
a
budget
surplu
of
over
$
200
billion
.
by
the
time
i
took
offic
,
we
had
a
1-year
deficit
of
over
$
1
trillion
and
project
deficit
of
$
8
trillion
over
the
next
decad
.
most
of
thi
wa
the
result
of
not
pay
for
two
war
,
two
tax
cut
,
and
an
expens
prescript
drug
program
.
on
top
of
that
,
the
effect
of
the
recess
put
a
$
3
trillion
hole
in
our
budget
.
all
thi
wa
befor
i
walk
in
the
door
.
now—just
state
the
fact
.
now
,
if
we
had
taken
offic
in
ordinari
time
,
i
would
have
like
noth
more
than
to
start
bring
down
the
deficit
.
but
we
took
offic
amid
a
crisi
.
and
our
effort
to
prevent
a
second
depress
have
ad
anoth
$
1
trillion
to
our
nation
debt
.
that
too
is
a
fact
.
i
'm
absolut
convinc
that
wa
the
right
thing
to
do
.
but
famili
across
the
countri
are
tighten
their
belt
and
make
tough
decis
.
the
feder
govern
should
do
the
same
.
so
tonight
i
'm
propos
specif
step
to
pay
for
the
trillion
dollar
that
it
took
to
rescu
the
economi
last
year
.
start
in
2011
,
we
are
prepar
to
freez
govern
spend
for
3
year
.
spend
relat
to
our
nation
secur
,
medicar
,
medicaid
,
and
social
secur
will
not
be
affect
.
but
all
other
discretionari
govern
program
will
.
like
ani
cash-strap
famili
,
we
will
work
within
a
budget
to
invest
in
what
we
need
and
sacrific
what
we
do
n't
.
and
if
i
have
to
enforc
thi
disciplin
by
veto
,
i
will
.
we
will
continu
to
go
through
the
budget
,
line
by
line
,
page
by
page
,
to
elimin
program
that
we
ca
n't
afford
and
do
n't
work
.
we
've
alreadi
identifi
$
20
billion
in
save
for
next
year
.
to
help
work
famili
,
we
'll
extend
our
middl
class
tax
cut
.
but
at
a
time
of
record
deficit
,
we
will
not
continu
tax
cut
for
oil
compani
,
for
invest
fund
manag
,
and
for
those
make
over
$
250,000
a
year
.
we
just
can't
afford
it
.
now
,
even
after
pay
for
what
we
spent
on
my
watch
,
we
'll
still
face
the
massiv
deficit
we
had
when
i
took
offic
.
more
importantli
,
the
cost
of
medicar
,
medicaid
,
and
social
secur
will
continu
to
skyrocket
.
that
's
whi
i
've
call
for
a
bipartisan
fiscal
commiss
,
model
on
a
propos
by
republican
judd
gregg
and
democrat
kent
conrad
.
thi
ca
n't
be
one
of
those
washington
gimmick
that
let
us
pretend
we
solv
a
problem
.
the
commiss
will
have
to
provid
a
specif
set
of
solut
by
a
certain
deadlin
.
now
,
yesterday
the
senat
block
a
bill
that
would
have
creat
thi
commiss
,
so
i'll
issu
an
execut
order
that
will
allow
us
to
go
forward
,
becaus
i
refus
to
pass
thi
problem
on
to
anoth
gener
of
american
.
and
when
the
vote
come
tomorrow
,
the
senat
should
restor
the
pay-as-you-go
law
that
wa
a
big
reason
for
whi
we
had
record
surplus
in
the
1990
.
now
,
i
know
that
some
in
my
own
parti
will
argu
that
we
ca
n't
address
the
deficit
or
freez
govern
spend
when
so
mani
are
still
hurt
.
and
i
agre
,
which
is
whi
thi
freez
wo
n't
take
effect
until
next
year
,
when
the
economi
is
stronger
.
that
's
how
budget
work
.
but
understand
,
if
we
do
n't
take
meaning
step
to
rein
in
our
debt
,
it
could
damag
our
market
,
increas
the
cost
of
borrow
,
and
jeopard
our
recoveri
,
all
of
which
would
have
an
even
wors
effect
on
our
job
growth
and
famili
incom
.
from
some
on
the
right
,
i
expect
we
'll
hear
a
differ
argument
,
that
if
we
just
make
fewer
invest
in
our
peopl
,
extend
tax
cut
,
includ
those
for
the
wealthier
american
,
elimin
more
regul
,
maintain
the
statu
quo
on
health
care
,
our
deficit
will
go
away
.
the
problem
is
,
that
's
what
we
did
for
8
year
.
that
's
what
help
us
into
thi
crisi
.
it
's
what
help
lead
to
these
deficit
.
we
ca
n't
do
it
again
.
rather
than
fight
the
same
tire
battl
that
have
domin
washington
for
decad
,
it'
time
to
tri
someth
new
.
let
's
invest
in
our
peopl
without
leav
them
a
mountain
of
debt
.
let
's
meet
our
respons
to
the
citizen
who
sent
us
here
.
let
's
tri
common
sense—a
novel
concept
.
now
,
to
do
that
,
we
have
to
recogn
that
we
face
more
than
a
deficit
of
dollar
right
now
.
we
face
a
deficit
of
trust
,
deep
and
corros
doubt
about
how
washington
work
that
have
been
grow
for
year
.
to
close
that
credibl
gap
,
we
have
to
take
action
on
both
end
of
pennsylvania
avenu
to
end
the
outsiz
influenc
of
lobbyist
,
to
do
our
work
openli
,
to
give
our
peopl
the
govern
they
deserv
.
now
,
that
's
what
i
came
to
washington
to
do
.
that
's
whi
,
for
the
first
time
in
histori
,
my
administr
post
on—our
white
hous
visitor
onlin
.
that
's
whi
we
've
exclud
lobbyist
from
policymak
job
or
seat
on
feder
board
and
commiss
.
but
we
ca
n't
stop
there
.
it
's
time
to
requir
lobbyist
to
disclos
each
contact
they
make
on
behalf
of
a
client
,
with
my
administr
or
with
congress
.
it
's
time
to
put
strict
limit
on
the
contribut
that
lobbyist
give
to
candid
for
feder
offic
.
with
all
due
defer
to
separ
of
power
,
last
week
,
the
suprem
court
revers
a
centuri
of
law
that
i
believ
will
open
the
floodgat
for
special
interest
,
includ
foreign
corpor
,
to
spend
without
limit
in
our
elect
.
i
do
n't
think
american
elect
should
be
bankrol
by
america
's
most
power
interest
,
or
wors
,
by
foreign
entiti
.
they
should
be
decid
by
the
american
peopl
.
and
i
'd
urg
democrat
and
republican
to
pass
a
bill
that
help
correct
some
of
these
problem
.
i
'm
also
call
on
congress
to
continu
down
the
path
of
earmark
reform
,
democrat
and
republicans—democrat
and
republican
.
look
,
you
've
trim
some
of
thi
spend
,
you
've
embrac
some
meaning
chang
,
but
restor
the
public
trust
demand
more
.
for
exampl
,
some
member
of
congress
post
some
earmark
request
onlin
.
tonight
i
'm
call
on
congress
to
publish
all
earmark
request
on
a
singl
web
site
befor
there
's
a
vote
so
that
the
american
peopl
can
see
how
their
money
is
be
spent
.
of
cours
,
none
of
these
reform
will
even
happen
if
we
do
n't
also
reform
how
we
work
with
one
anoth
.
now
,
i
'm
not
naiv
.
i
never
thought
that
the
mere
fact
of
my
elect
would
usher
in
peac
and
harmoni
and—som
postpartisan
era
.
i
knew
that
both
parti
have
fed
divis
that
are
deepli
entrench
.
and
on
some
issu
,
there
are
simpli
philosoph
differ
that
will
alway
caus
us
to
part
way
.
these
disagr
,
about
the
role
of
govern
in
our
live
,
about
our
nation
prioriti
and
our
nation
secur
,
they
've
been
take
place
for
over
200
year
.
they
're
the
veri
essenc
of
our
democraci
.
but
what
frustrat
the
american
peopl
is
a
washington
where
everi
day
is
elect
day
.
we
ca
n't
wage
a
perpetu
campaign
where
the
onli
goal
is
to
see
who
can
get
the
most
embarrass
headlin
about
the
other
side
,
a
belief
that
if
you
lose
,
i
win
.
neither
parti
should
delay
or
obstruct
everi
singl
bill
just
becaus
they
can
.
the
confirm
of—i
'm
speak
to
both
parti
now
.
the
confirm
of
well-qualifi
public
servant
should
n't
be
held
hostag
to
the
pet
project
or
grudg
of
a
few
individu
senat
.
washington
may
think
that
say
anyth
about
the
other
side
,
no
matter
how
fals
,
no
matter
how
malici
,
is
just
part
of
the
game
.
but
it
's
precis
such
polit
that
ha
stop
either
parti
from
help
the
american
peopl
.
wors
yet
,
it
's
sow
further
divis
among
our
citizen
,
further
distrust
in
our
govern
.
so
,
no
,
i
will
not
give
up
on
tri
to
chang
the
tone
of
our
polit
.
i
know
it
's
an
elect
year
.
and
after
last
week
,
it
's
clear
that
campaign
fever
ha
come
even
earlier
than
usual
.
but
we
still
need
to
govern
.
to
democrat
,
i
would
remind
you
that
we
still
have
the
largest
major
in
decad
and
the
peopl
expect
us
to
solv
problem
,
not
run
for
the
hill
.
and
if
the
republican
leadership
is
go
to
insist
that
60
vote
in
the
senat
are
requir
to
do
ani
busi
at
all
in
thi
town—a
supermajority—then
the
respons
to
govern
is
now
your
as
well
.
just
say
no
to
everyth
may
be
good
short-term
polit
,
but
it'
not
leadership
.
we
were
sent
here
to
serv
our
citizen
,
not
our
ambit
.
so
let'
show
the
american
peopl
that
we
can
do
it
togeth
.
thi
week
,
i
'll
be
address
a
meet
of
the
hous
republican
.
i
'd
like
to
begin
monthli
meet
with
both
democrat
and
republican
leadership
.
i
know
you
ca
n't
wait
.
now
,
throughout
our
histori
,
no
issu
ha
unit
thi
countri
more
than
our
secur
.
sadli
,
some
of
the
uniti
we
felt
after
9/11
ha
dissip
.
and
we
can
argu
all
we
want
about
who
's
to
blame
for
thi
,
but
i
'm
not
interest
in
relitig
the
past
.
i
know
that
all
of
us
love
thi
countri
.
all
of
us
are
commit

it
defens
.
so
let
's
put
asid
the
schoolyard
taunt
about
who
's
tough
.
let
's
reject
the
fals
choic
between

and
uphold
our

let
's
leav
behind
the
fear
and
divis
and
do
what
it
take
to
defend
our
nation
and
forg
a
more
hope
futur
for
america
and
for

.
that

sinc

we

so
they
can

and
just

,
we
all
have
a
respons
to
support
them
when

now
,
even

we
're
also
confront
perhap
the
greatest
danger
to
the
american
peopl
,
the
threat
of
nuclear
weapon
.
i
've
embrac
the
vision
of
john
f.
kennedi
and
ronald
reagan
through
a
strategi
that
revers
the
spread
of

and
seek
a

to

while

the

also
strengthen
our

in
deal
with
those

america
take
these
action
becaus
our

america

greatest
sourc
of

ha
alway
been

the

in

they

unfortun

too
mani
of

have
lost

that
our

and

our

reflect
these

each
of
these

full
of

but
each

each

i
campaign
on

.
chang
we
can
believ
in

the
slogan
went
.
and
right
now
i
know
there
are
mani
american
who
are
n't
sure
if
they
still
believ
we
can
chang
or
that
i
can
deliv
it
.
but
rememb
thi
:
i
never
suggest
that
chang
would
be
easi
or
that
i
could
do
it
alon
.
democraci
in
a
nation
of
300
million
peopl
can
be
noisi

messi
and
complic
.
and
when
you
tri
to
do
big
thing
and
make
big
chang
,
it
stir
passion
and
controversi
.
that
's
just
how
it
is
.
those
of
us
in
public
offic
can
respond
to
thi
realiti
by
play
it
safe
and
avoid
tell
hard
truth
and
point

we
can
do
what
's
necessari
to

.
and
what
keep
me
go
,
what
keep

is
that
despit
all
these
setback
,
that
spirit
of
determin
and

that

decenc
that

alway
been
at
the
core
of
the
american
peopl
,
that

that

on
in
the
woman
who
said
that
even
though
she
and
her

have
felt
the
pain
of
recess
,
``
we
are
strong
.
we
are
resili
.
we
are
american
.
''
it
live
on
in
the
8-year-old
boy
in
louisiana
who
just
sent
me
hi

ask
if
