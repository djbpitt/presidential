inform
of
the
state
of

measur
as
may
be
judg
necessari

public
servic
and
confin
myself
to
those
matter
of
more
gener
public
polici
with
which
it
seem
necessari
and
feasibl
to
deal
at
the
present
session
of
the
congress
.
i
realiz
the
limit
of
time
under
which
you
will
necessarili
act
at
thi
session
and
shall
make
my
suggest
as
few
as
possibl
;
but
there
were
some
thing
left
undon
at
the
last
session
which
there
will
now
be
time
to
complet
and
which
it
seem
necessari
in
the
interest
of
the
public
to
do
at
onc
.
in
the
first
place
,
it
seem
to
me
imper
necessari
that
the
earliest
possibl
consider
and
action
should
be
accord
the
remain
measur
of
the
program
of
settlement
and
regul
which
i
had
occas
to
recommend
to
you
at
the
close
of
your
last
session
in
view
of
the
public
danger
disclos
by
the
unaccommod
difficulti
which
then
exist
,
and
which
still
unhappili
continu
to
exist
,
between
the
railroad
of
the
countri
and
their
locomot
engin
,
conductor
and
trainmen
.
i
then
recommend
:
first
,
immedi
provis
for
the
enlarg
and
administr
reorgan
of
the
interst
commerc
commiss
along
the

embodi

variou
duti
now
devolv
upon

thorough
which
are
,
with
it

,
practic
imposs
.
second
,
the
establish
of

as

alik
of

in
the
employ
of
all
railway

who
are

in

third
,
the

of
the

to

actual

in

of
the
adopt
of
the
eight-hour

in

transport
alik
for
the
men
and
for

.
fourth
,
explicit
approv
by
the
congress
of
the
consider
by
the
interst
commerc
commiss
of
an
increas
of
freight
rate
to
meet
such
addit
expenditur
by
the
railroad
as
may
have
been
render
necessari
by
the
adopt
of
the
eight-hour
day
and
which
have
not
been
offset
by
administr
readjust
and
economi
,
should
the
fact
disclos
justifi
the
increas
.
fifth
,
an
amend
of
the
exist
feder
statut
which
provid
for
the
mediat
,
concili
and
arbitr
of
such
controversi
as
the
present
by
ad
to
it
a
provis
that
,
in
case
the
method
of
accommod
now
provid
for
should
fail
,
a
full
public
investig
of
the
merit
of
everi
such
disput
shall
be
institut
and
complet
befor
a
strike
or
lockout
may
law
be
attempt
.
and
,
sixth
,
the
lodgment
in
the
hand
of
the
execut
of
the
power
,
in
case
of
militari
necess
,
to
take
control
of
such
portion
and
such
roll
stock
of
the
railway
of
the
countri
as
may
be
requir
for
militari
use
and
to
oper
them
for

purpos
,
with
author
to
draft
into
the

of
the
unit
state
such
train
crew
and
administr
offici
as
the
circumst
requir
for
their
safe
and
effici
use
.
the
second
and
third
of
these
recommend
the
congress
immedi
act
on
:
it
establish
the
eight-hour
day
as
the
legal
basi
of
work
and
wage
in
train
servic
and
it
author
the
appoint
of
a
commiss
to
observ
and
report
upon
the
practic
result
,
deem
these
the
measur
most
immedi
need
;
but
it
postpon
action
upon
the
other
suggest
until
an
opportun
should
be
offer
for
a
more
deliber
consider
of
them
.
the
fourth
recommend
i
do
not
deem
it
necessari
to
renew
.
the
power
of
the
interst
commerc
commiss
to
grant
an
increas
of
rate
on
the
ground
refer
to
is
indisput
clear
and
a
recommend
by
the
congress
with
regard
to
such
a
matter
might
seem
to
draw
in
question
the
scope
of
the
commiss
's
author
or
it
inclin
to
do
justic
when
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
either
.
the
other
suggestions-th
increas
in
the
interst
commerc
commiss
's
membership
and
in
it
facil
for
perform
it
manifold
duti
;
the
provis
for
full
public
investig
and
assess
of
industri
disput
,
and
the
grant
to
the
execut
of
the
power
to
control
and
oper
the
railway
when
necessari
in
time
of
war
or
other
like
public
necessity-i
now
veri
earnestli
renew
.
the
necess
for
such
legisl
is
manifest
and
press
.
those
who
have
entrust
us
with
the
respons
and
duti
of
serv
and
safeguard
them
in
such
matter
would
find
it
hard
,
i
believ
,
to
excus
a
failur
to
act
upon
these
grave
matter
or
ani
unnecessari
postpon
of
action
upon
them
.
not
onli
doe
the
interst
commerc
commiss
now
find
it
practic
imposs
,
with
it
present
membership
and
organ
,
to
perform
it
great
function
promptli
and
thoroughli
,
but
it
is
not
unlik
that
it
may
present
be
found
advis
to
add
to
it
duti
still
other
equal
heavi
and
exact
.
it
must
first
be
perfect
as
an
administr
instrument
.
the
countri
can
not
and
should
not
consent
to
remain
ani
longer
expos
to
profound
industri
disturb
for
lack
of
addit
mean
of
arbitr
and
concili
which
the
congress
can
easili
and
promptli
suppli
.
and
all
will
agre
that
there
must
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
the
execut
to
make
immedi
and
uninterrupt
use
of
the
railroad
for
the
concentr
of
the
militari
forc
of
the
nation
wherev
they
are
need
and
whenev
they
are
need
.
thi
is
a
program
of
regul
,
prevent
and
administr
effici
which
argu
it
own
case
in
the
mere
statement
of
it
.
with
regard
to
one
of
it
item
,
the
increas
in
the
effici
of
the
interst
commerc
commiss
,
the
hous
of
repres
ha
alreadi
act
;
it
action
need
onli
the
concurr
of
the
senat
.
i
would
hesit
to
recommend
,
and
i
dare
say
the
congress
would
hesit
to
act
upon
the
suggest
should
i
make
it
,
that
ani
man
in
ani
i
occup
should
be
oblig
by
law
to
continu
in
an
employ
which
he
desir
to
leav
.
to
pass
a
law
which
forbad
or
prevent
the
individu
workman
to
leav
hi
work
befor
receiv
the
approv
of
societi
in
do
so
would
be
to
adopt
a
new
principl
into
our
jurisprud
,
which
i
take
it
for
grant
we
are
not
prepar
to
introduc
.
but
the
propos
that
the
oper
of
the
railway
of
the
countri
shall
not
be
stop
or
interrupt
by
the
concert
action
of
organ
bodi
of
men
until
a
public
investig
shall
have
been
institut
,
which
shall
make
the
whole
question
at
issu
plain
for
the
judgment
of
the
opinion
of
the
nation
,
is
not
to
propos
ani
such
principl
.
it
is
base
upon
the
veri
differ
principl
that
the
concert
action
of
power
bodi
of
men
shall
not
be
permit
to
stop
the
industri
process
of
the
nation
,
at
ani
rate
befor
the
nation
shall
have
had
an
opportun
to
acquaint
itself
with
the
merit
of
the
case
as
between
employ
and
employ
,
time
to
form
it
opinion
upon
an
imparti
statement
of
the
merit
,
and
opportun
to
consid
all
practic
mean
of
concili
or
arbitr
.
i
can
see
noth
in
that
proposit
but
the
justifi
safeguard
by
societi
of
the
necessari
process
of
it
veri
life
.
there
is
noth
arbitrari
or
unjust
in
it
unless
it
be
arbitrarili
and
unjustli
done
.
it
can
and
should
be
done
with
a
full
and
scrupul
regard
for
the
interest
and
liberti
of
all
concern
as
well
as
for
the
perman
interest
of
societi
itself
.
three
matter
of
capit
import
await
the
action
of
the
senat
which
have
alreadi
been
act
upon
by
the
hous
of
repres
;
the
bill
which
seek
to
extend
greater
freedom
of
combin
to
those
engag
in
promot
the
foreign
commerc
of
the
countri
than
is
now
thought
by
some
to
be
legal
under
the
term
of
the
law
against
monopoli
;
the
bill
amend
the
present
organ
law
of
porto

;
and
the
bill

a
more
thorough
and
systemat
regul
of
the
expenditur
of

in

,
commonli
call
the
corrupt

.
i
need
not
labor
my
advic
that
these
measur
be
enact

law
.
their
urgenc
lie
in
the
manifest
circumst
which
render
their
adopt
at
thi
time
not
onli
opportun
but
necessari
.
even
delay
would
serious
jeopard
the
interest
of
the
countri
and
of
the
govern
.
immedi
passag
of
the
bill
to
regul
the
expenditur
of
money
in
elect
may
seem
to
be
less
necessari
than
the
immedi
enact
of
the
other
measur
to
which
i
refer
,
becaus
at
least
two
year
will
elaps
befor
anoth
elect
in
which
feder
offic
are
to
be
fill
;
but
it
would
greatli
reliev
the
public
mind
if
thi
import
matter
were
dealt
with
while
the
circumst
and
the
danger
to
the
public
moral
of
the
present
method
of
obtain
and
spend
campaign
fund
stand
clear
under
recent
observ
,
and
the
method
of
expenditur
can
be
frankli
studi
in
the
light
of
present
experi

and
a
delay
would
have
the
further
veri
seriou
disadvantag
of
postpon
action
until
anoth
elect
wa
at
hand
and
some
special
object
connect
with
it
might
be
thought
to
be
in
the
mind
of
those
who
urg
it
.
action
can
be
taken
now
with
fact
for
guidanc
and
without
suspicion
of
partisan
purpos
.
i
shall
not
argu
at
length
the
desir
of
give
a
freer
hand
in
the
matter
of
combin
and
concert
effort
to
those
who
shall
undertak
the
essenti

of

that
enterpris
will

we
have
not
the
necessari
instrument
for
it
prosecut
;
it
is
deem
to
be
doubt
whether
they
could
be
creat
upon
an
adequ
scale
under
our
present
law
.
we
should
clear
away
all
legal
obstacl
and
creat
a
basi
of
undoubt
law
for
it
which
will
give
freedom
without

the
thing
must
be
done
now
,
becaus
the
opportun
is
here
and
may
escap
us
if
we
hesit
or
delay
.
the
argument
for
the
propos
amend
of
the
organ
law
of
porto
rico
is
brief
and
conclus
.
the
present
law
govern

we

there
is

among
the
peopl
of

and
even
a

to
our

do
not

at

it
