sinc
the

for
which
i
have
been
again
call
into

no
fit
occas
ha
arisen
for
express
to
me
fellow
citizen
at
larg
the
deep
and
respect
sens
which
i
feel
of
the
renew
testimoni
of
public
approb
.
while
on
the
one
hand
it
awaken
my
gratitud
for
all
those
instanc
of
affection
partial
with
which
i
have
been
honor
by
my
countri

on
the
other
it
could
not
prevent
an
earnest
wish
for
that
retir
from
which
no
privat
consider
should
ever
have
torn
me
.
but
influenc
by
the
belief
that
my
conduct
would
be
estim
accord
to
it
real
motiv
,
and
that
the
peopl
,
and
the
author
deriv
from
them
,
would
support
exert
have
noth
person
for
their
object
,
i
have
obey
the
suffrag
which
command
me
to
resum
the
execut
power
;
and
i
humbl
implor
that
be
on
whose
will
the
fate
of
nation
depend
to
crown
with
success
our
mutual
endeavor
for
the
gener
happi
.
as
soon
as
the
war
in
europ
had
embrac
those
power
with
whom
the
unit
state
have
the
most
extens
relat
there
wa
reason
to
apprehend
that
our
intercours
with
them
might
be
interrupt
and
our
disposit
for
peac
drawn
into
question
by
the
suspicion
too
often
entertain
by
belliger
nation
.
it
seem
,
therefor
,
to
be
my
duti
to
admonish
our
citizen
of
the
consequ
of
a
contraband
trade
and
of
hostil
act
to
ani
of
the
parti
,
and
to
obtain
by
a
declar
of
the
exist
legal
state
of
thing
an
easier
admiss
of
our
right
to
the
immun

to
our

under
these
impress
the
proclam
which
will
be
laid
befor
you
wa
issu

in
thi
postur
of
affair
,
both
new

i
resolv
to
adopt
gener
rule
which
should
conform
to
the
treati
and
assert
the
privileg
of
the
unit
state
.
these
were
reduc
into
a
system
,
which
will
be
commun
to
you
.
although
i
have
not
thought
of
myself
at
liberti
to
forbid
the
sale
of
the
prize
permit
by
our
treati
of
commerc
with
franc
to
be
brought
into
our
port
,
i
have
not
refus
to
caus
them
to
be
restor
when
they
were
taken
within
the
protect
of
our
territori
,
or
by
vessel
commiss
or
equip
in
a
warlik
form
within
the
limit
of
the
unit
state
.
it
rest
with
the
wisdom
of
congress
to
correct
,
improv
,
or
enforc
thi
plan
of
procedur
;
and
it
will
probabl
be
found
expedi
to
extend
the
legal
code
and
the
jurisdict
of
the
court
of
the
unit
state
to
mani
case
which
,
though
depend
on
principl
alreadi
recogn
,
demand
some
further
provis
.
where
individu
shall
,
within
the
unit
state
,
array
themselv
in
hostil
against
ani
of
the
power
at
war
,
or
enter
upon
militari
expedit
or
enterpris
within
the
jurisdict
of
the
unit

,
or
usurp

exercis
judici
author
within
the
unit

,
or
where
the
penalti
on
violat
of
the
law
of
nation
may
have
been
indistinctli

,
or
are
inadequ
-
these
offens
can
not
receiv
too
earli
and
close
an
attent

and
requir
prompt
and
decis
remedi
.
whatsoev
those
remedi

be
,
they
will
be
well
administ
by
the
judiciari
,
who
possess
a
long-establish
cours
of
investig

effectu
process
,
and
offic
in
the
habit
of
execut
it

in
like
manner
,
as
sever
of
the
court
have
doubt
,
under
particular
circumst

their
power
to
liber
the
vessel
of
a
nation
at
peac
,
and
even
of
a
citizen
of
the
unit

,
although
seiz
under
a
fals
color

be
hostil
properti
,
and
have
deni
their
power
to
liber
certain
captur
within
the
protect
of
our
territori
,
it
would
seem
proper
to
regul
their
jurisdict
in
these
point
.
but
if
the
execut
is
to
be
the
resort
in
either
of
the
two
last-ment
case
,
it
is
hope
that
he
will
be
author
by
law
to
have
fact
ascertain
by
the
court
when
for
hi
own
inform
he
shall
request
it
.
i
can
not
recommend
to
your
notic
measur
for
the
fulfil
of
our
duti
to
the
rest
of
the
world
without
again
press
upon
you
the
necess
of
place
ourselv
in
a
condit
of
complet
defens
and
of
exact
from
them
the
fulfil
of
their
duti
toward
us
.
the
unit
state
ought
not
to
indulg
a
persuas
that
,
contrari
to
the
order
of
human
event
,
they
will
forev
keep
at
a
distanc
those
pain
appeal
to
arm
with
which
the
histori
of
everi
other
nation
abound
.
there
is
a
rank
due
to
the
unit
state
among
nation
which
will
be
withheld
,
if
not
absolut
lost
,
by
the
reput
of
weak
.
if
we
desir
to
avoid
insult
,
we
must
be
abl
to
repel
it
;
if
we
desir
to
secur
peac
,
one
of
the
most
power
instrument
of
our
rise
prosper
,
it
must
be
known
that
we
are
at
all
time
readi
for
war
.
the
document
which
will
be
present
to
you
will
shew
the
amount
and
kind
of
arm
and
militari
store
now
in
our
magazin
and
arsen

and
yet
an
addit
even
to
these
suppli
can
not
with
prudenc
be
neglect
,
as
it
would
leav
noth
to
the
uncertainti
of
procur
warlik
apparatu
in
the
moment
of
public
danger
.
nor
can
such
arrang
,
with
such
object
,
be
expos
to
the
censur
or
jealousi
of
the
warmest
friend
of
republican
govern
.
they
are
incap
of
abus
in
the
hand
of
the
militia
,
who
ought
to
possess
a
pride
in
be
the
depositori
of
the
forc
of
the
republ
,
and
may
be
train
to
a
degre
of
energi
equal
to
everi
militari
exig
of
the
unit

.
but
it
is
an
inquiri
which
can
not
be
too
solemnli
pursu
,
whether
the
act
``
more

to
provid
for
the
nation
defens
by
establish
an
uniform
militia
throughout
the
unit
state
''
ha
organ
them
so
as
to
produc
their
full
effect
;
whether
your
own
experi
in
the
sever
state
ha
not
detect
some
imperfect
in
the
scheme
,
and
whether
a
materi
featur
in
an
improv
of
it
ought
not
to
be
to
afford
an
opportun
for
the
studi
of
those
branch
of
the
militari
art
which
can
scarc
ever
be
attain
by
practic
alon

the
connect
of
the
unit

with
europ
ha
becom
extrem

the
occurr
which
relat

it
and
have
pass
under

knowledg

the

will
be
exhibit
to
congress
in
a
subsequ
commun

when
we
contempl
the
war
on
our
frontier
,
it
may
be
truli
affirm
that
everi
reason
effort
ha
been
made
to
adjust
the
caus
of

with
the
indian
north
of

the

from
a
sincer
love
of

and
a

the

the
attempt

of

been
frustrat

although
the

it
is
doubt
how

the

befor

may
retard
them
dure
the

from
the
paper
and
intellig
which
relat

thi
import
subject
you
will
determin
whether
the
defici
in
the
number
of

shall
be
compens

of

or
addit

an

ha
been
also
demonstr

the

the

have
been
reliev

been

but
the
paper

will
be

you
disclos
the
critic
foot
on
which
we
stand
in

both

it
is
with
congress
to
pronounc
what
shall

after

the

most
like

without

it

gentlemen
of

the
commission
charg
with
the
settlement
of
account
between
the
unit

conclud
their
import
function
within
the

by

and
the
balanc
struck
in
their
report
,
which
will
be
laid
befor

,
have
been
place
on
the
book
of
the
treasuri

on
the
first
day
of
june
last
an
instal
of
1,000,000
florin
becam
payabl
on
the
loan
of
the

.
thi
wa
adjust
by
a
prolong
of
the
period
of
reimburs
in
natur
of
a
new
loan
at
an
interest
of
5
%
for
the
term
of
ten
year
,
and
the
expens
of
thi
oper
were
a
commiss
of
3
%

the
first
instal
of
the
loan
of
$
2,000,000
from
the
bank
of
the
unit

ha
been
paid
,
as
wa
direct
by

.
for
the
second
it
is
necessari
that
provis
be
made
.
no
pecuniari
consider
is
more
urgent
than
the
regular
redempt
and
discharg
of
the
public
debt
.
on
none
can
delay
be
more
injuri
or
an
economi
of

more
valuabl
.
the
product
of
the
public
revenu
hitherto
ha
continu
to
equal
the
anticip
which
were
form
of
it
,
but
it
is
not
expect
to
prove
commensur
with
all
the
object
which
have
been
suggest

some
auxiliari
provis
will
therefor
,
it
is
presum

be

and
it
is
hope
that
these
may
be
made
consist
with
a
due

the

who
can
not

be

true

of
encount
a

to
their

but
here
i
can
not
forbear
to
recommend
a
repeal
of

on

there
is
no

to

the

open

permit
me
to
bring
to

the
magnitud

without
an

the

without

it

but
as

never

i

be
