my
fellow
citizen
:
the
four
year
which
have
elaps
sinc
last
i
stood
in
thi
place
havebeen
crowd
with
counsel
and
action
of
the
most
vital
interest
and
consequence.perhap
no
equal
period
in
our
histori
ha
been
so
fruit
of
importantreform
in
our
econom
and
industri
life
or
so
full
of
signific
changesin
the
spirit
and
purpos
of
our
polit
action
.
we
have
sought
verythought
to
set
our
hous
in
order
,
correct
the
grosser
error
andabus
of
our
industri
life
,
liber
and
quicken
the
process
of
ournat
geniu
and
energi
,
and
lift
our
polit
to
a
broader
view
ofth
peopl
's
essenti
interest
.
it
is
a
record
of
singular
varieti
and
singular
distinct
.
but
i
shallnot
attempt
to
review
it
.
it
speak
for
itself
and
will
be
of
increasinginflu
as
the
year
go
by
.
thi
is
not
the
time
for
retrospect
.
it
istim
rather
to
speak
our
thought
and
purpos
concern
the
present
andth
immedi
futur
.
although
we
have
center
counsel
and
action
with
such
unusu
concentrationand
success
upon
the
great
problem
of
domest
legisl
to
which
weaddress
ourselv
four
year
ago
,
other
matter
have
more
and
more
forcedthemselv
upon
our
attent
--
matter
lie
outsid
our
own
life
as
anat
and
over
which
we
had
no
control
,
but
which
,
despit
our
wish
tokeep
free
of
them
,
have
drawn
us
more
and
more
irresist
into
theirown
current
and
influenc
.
it
ha
been
imposs
to
avoid
them
.
they
have
affect
the
life
ofth
whole
world
.
they
have
shaken
men
everywher
with
a
passion
and
anapprehens
they
never
knew
befor
.
it
ha
been
hard
to
preserv
calmcounsel
while
the
thought
of
our
own
peopl
sway
thi
way
and
that
undertheir
influenc
.
we
are
a
composit
and
cosmopolitan
peopl
.
we
are
ofth
blood
of
all
the
nation
that
are
at
war
.
the
current
of
our
thoughtsa
well
as
the
current
of
our
trade
run
quick
at
all
season
back
andforth
between
us
and
them
.
the
war
inevit
set
it
mark
from
the
firstalik
upon
our
mind
,
our
industri
,
our
commerc
,
our
polit
and
oursoci
action
.
to
be
indiffer
to
it
,
or
independ
of
it
,
wa
out
ofth
question
.
and
yet
all
the
while
we
have
been
consciou
that
we
were
not
part
ofit
.
in
that
conscious
,
despit
mani
divis
,
we
have
drawn
closertogeth
.
we
have
been
deepli
wrong
upon
the
sea
,
but
we
have
not
wishedto
wrong
or
injur
in
return
;
have
retain
throughout
the
consciousnessof
stand
in
some
sort
apart
,
intent
upon
an
interest
that
transcendedth
immedi
issu
of
the
war
itself
.
as
some
of
the
injuri
done
us
have
becom
intoler
we
have
stillbeen
clear
that
we
wish
noth
for
ourselv
that
we
were
not
readyto
demand
for
all
mankind
--
fair
deal
,
justic
,
the
freedom
to
live
andto
be
at
eas
against
organ
wrong
.
it
is
in
thi
spirit
and
with
thi
thought
that
we
have
grown
more
andmor
awar
,
more
and
more
certain
that
the
part
we
wish
to
play
wa
thepart
of
those
who
mean
to
vindic
and
fortifi
peac
.
we
have
been
obligedto
arm
ourselv
to
make
good
our
claim
to
a
certain
minimum
of
right
andof
freedom
of
action
.
we
stand
firm
in
arm
neutral
sinc
it
seemsthat
in
no
other
way
we
can
demonstr
what
it
is
we
insist
upon
and
cannotforget
.
we
may
even
be
drawn
on
,
by
circumst
,
not
by
our
own
purposeor
desir
,
to
a
more
activ
assert
of
our
right
as
we
see
them
anda
more
immedi
associ
with
the
great
struggl
itself
.
but
nothingwil
alter
our
thought
or
our
purpos
.
they
are
too
clear
to
be
obscured.they
are
too
deepli
root
in
the
principl
of
our
nation
life
to
bealter
.
we
desir
neither
conquest
nor
advantag
.
we
wish
noth
thatcan
be
had
onli
at
the
cost
of
anoth
peopl
.
we
alway
profess
unselfishpurpos
and
we
covet
the
opportun
to
prove
our
profess
are
sincer
.
there
are
mani
thing
still
to
be
done
at
home
,
to
clarifi
our
own
politicsand
add
new
vital
to
the
industri
process
of
our
own
life
,
and
weshal
do
them
as
time
and
opportun
serv
,
but
we
realiz
that
the
greatestth
that
remain
to
be
done
must
be
done
with
the
whole
world
for
stageand
in
cooper
with
the
wide
and
univers
forc
of
mankind
,
and
wear
make
our
spirit
readi
for
those
thing
.
we
are
provinci
no
longer
.
the
tragic
event
of
the
thirti
monthsof
vital
turmoil
through
which
we
have
just
pass
have
made
us
citizensof
the
world
.
there
can
be
no
turn
back
.
our
own
fortun
as
a
nationar
involv
whether
we
would
have
it
so
or
not
.
and
yet
we
are
not
the
less
american
on
that
account
.
we
shall
be
themor
american
if
we
but
remain
true
to
the
principl
in
which
we
havebeen
bred
.
they
are
not
the
principl
of
a
provinc
or
of
a
singl
continent.w
have
known
and
boast
all
along
that
they
were
the
principl
of
aliber
mankind
.
these
,
therefor
,
are
the
thing
we
shall
stand
for
,
whether
in
war
or
in
peac
:
that
all
nation
are
equal
interest
in
the
peac
of
the
world
andin
the
polit
stabil
of
free
peopl
,
and
equal
respons
fortheir
mainten
;
that
the
essenti
principl
of
peac
is
the
actualequ
of
nation
in
all
matter
of
right
or
privileg
;
that
peac
cannotsecur
or
justli
rest
upon
an
arm
balanc
of
power
;
that
governmentsder
all
their
just
power
from
the
consent
of
the
govern
and
thatno
other
power
should
be
support
by
the
common
thought
,
purpos
or
powerof
the
famili
of
nation
;
that
the
sea
should
be
equal
free
and
safefor
the
use
of
all
peopl
,
under
rule
set
up
by
common
agreement
andcons
,
and
that
,
so
far
as
practic
,
they
should
be
access
toall
upon
equal
term
;
that
nation
armament
shall
be
limit
to
the
necessitiesof
nation
order
and
domest
safeti
;
that
the
commun
of
interest
andof
power
upon
which
peac
must
henceforth
depend
impos
upon

of
see
to
it
that
all

from
it

to
