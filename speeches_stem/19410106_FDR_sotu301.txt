mr.

,
mr.
speaker

member
of
the
seventy-seventh
congress
:
i
address
you
,
the
member
of
the
seventy-seventh
congress
,
at
a
moment
unpreced
in
the
histori
of
the
union
.
i
use
the
word
``
unpreced
,
''
becaus
at
no
previou
time
ha
american
secur
been
as
serious
threaten
from
without
as
it
is
today
.
sinc
the
perman
format
of
our
govern
under
the
constitut
,
in
1789
,
most
of
the
period
of
crisi
in
our
histori
have
relat
to
our
domest
affair
.
fortun
,
onli
one
of
these—th
four-year
war
between
the
states—ev
threaten
our
nation
uniti
.
today
,
thank
god
,
one
hundr
and
thirti
million
american
,
in
forty-eight
state
,
have
forgotten
point
of
the
compass
in
our
nation
uniti
.
it
is
true
that
prior
to
1914
the
unit
state
often
had
been
disturb
by
event
in
other
contin
.
we
had
even
engag
in
two
war
with
european
nation
and
in
a
number
of
undeclar
war
in
the
west
indi
,
in
the
mediterranean
and
in
the
pacif
for
the
mainten
of
american
right
and
for
the
principl
of
peac
commerc
.
but
in
no
case
had
a
seriou
threat
been
rais
against
our
nation
safeti
or
our
continu
independ
.
what
i
seek
to
convey
is
the
histor
truth
that
the
unit
state
as
a
nation
ha
at
all
time
maintain
clear
,
definit
opposit
,
to
ani
attempt
to
lock
us
in
behind
an
ancient
chines
wall
while
the
process
of
civil
went
past
.
today
,
think
of
our
children
and
of
their
children
,
we
oppos
enforc
isol
for
ourselv
or
for
ani
other
part
of
the
america
.
that
determin
of
our
,
extend
over
all
these
year
,
wa
prove
,
for
exampl
,
dure
the
quarter
centuri
of
war
follow
the
french
revolut
.
while
the
napoleon
struggl
did
threaten
interest
of
the
unit
state
becaus
of
the
french
foothold
in
the
west
indi
and
in
louisiana
,
and
while
we
engag
in
the
war
of
1812
to
vindic
our
right
to
peac
trade
,
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
neither
franc
nor
great
britain
,
nor
ani
other
nation
,
wa
aim
at
domin
of
the
whole
world
.
in
like
fashion
from
1815
to
1914—
ninety-nin
years—
no
singl
war
in
europ
or
in
asia
constitut
a
real
threat
against
our
futur
or
against
the
futur
of
ani
other
american
nation
.
except
in
the
maximilian
interlud
in
mexico
,
no
foreign
power
sought
to
establish
itself
in
thi
hemispher
;
and
the
strength
of
the
british
fleet
in
the
atlant
ha
been
a
friendli
strength
.
it
is
still
a
friendli
strength
.
even
when
the
world
war
broke
out
in
1914
,
it
seem
to
contain
onli
small
threat
of
danger
to
our
own
american
futur
.
but
,
as
time
went
on
,
the
american
peopl
began
to
visual
what
the
downfal
of
democrat
nation
might
mean
to
our
own
democraci
.
we
need
not
overemphas
imperfect
in
the
peac
of
versail
.
we
need
not
harp
on
failur
of
the
democraci
to
deal
with
problem
of
world
reconstruct
.
we
should
rememb
that
the
peac
of
1919
wa
far
less
unjust
than
the
kind
of
``
pacif
''
which
began
even
befor
munich
,
and
which
is
be
carri
on
under
the
new
order
of
tyranni
that
seek
to
spread
over
everi
contin
today
.
the
american
peopl
have
unalter
set
their
face
against
that
tyranni
.
everi
realist
know
that
the
democrat
way
of
life
is
at
thi
moment
be
'
directli
assail
in
everi
part
of
the
world—assail
either
by
arm
,
or
by
secret

of
poison
propaganda
by
those
who
seek
to
destroy
uniti
and
promot
discord
in

that
are
still
at

dure
sixteen

blot
out

''
as

we
may
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
we
are
softheart

but
we
can
not
afford
to
be
soft-head

we
must
alway
be
wari
of
those
who
with
sound
brass
and
a

preach
the

of

we

especi
bewar

of

who
would

i
have
recent

out
how
quickli
the

could
bring
into
our

the
physic
attack
which
we
must
eventu
expect
if

.
there
is
much
loos
talk
of
our
immun
from
immedi
and
direct
invas
from
across
the
sea
.
obvious
,
as
long
as
the
british
navi
retain
it
power
,
no
such
danger
exist
.
even
if
there
were
no
british
navi
,
it
is
not
probabl
that
ani
enemi
would
be
stupid
enough
to
attack
us
by
land
troop
in
the
unit
state
from
across
thousand
of
mile
of
ocean
,
until
it
had
acquir
strateg

from
which
to

but
we
learn
much
from
the
lesson
of
the
past
year
in
europe-particularli
the
lesson
of
norway
,
whose
essenti
seaport
were
captur
by
treacheri
and
surpris
built
up
over
a
seri
of
year
.
the
first
phase
of
the

would
not
be
the
land
of

.
the
necessari
strateg

would
be
occupi
by
secret

and
their
dupes-
and
great
number
of
them
are
alreadi
here

and
in

as

as

maintain
the

they-not

the

no

our

to

we

we

we
are
work

to

no

the
greatest
difficulti
come
at

when
new

the

must

howev

there
is

as

will
readili

,
in
the
interest
of

must

be
kept
in

new

constantli
beget
new
need

i
shall
ask
thi
congress
for
greatli
increas
new
appropri
and
author
to
carri
on
what
we
have
begun
.
i
also
ask
thi

for
author

for
fund
suffici
to
manufactur
addit
munit

war
suppli
of
mani
kind
,
to
be
turn
over
to
those
nation
which
are
now
in
actual
war
with
aggressor

.
our
most
use
and
immedi
role
is
to
act
as
an
arsen
for
them
as
well
as
for
ourselv
.
they
do
not
need
man
power
,
but
they
do
need
billion
of
dollar
worth
of
the
weapon
of
defens
.
the
time
is
near
when
they
will
not
be
abl
to
pay
for
them
all
in
readi
cash
.
we
can
not
,
and
we
will
not

tell
them
that
they
must
surrend

mere
becaus
of
present
inabl
to
pay
for
the
weapon
which
we
know
they
must
have
.
i
do
not
recommend
that
we
make
them
a
loan
of
dollar
with
which
to
pay
for
these
weapons—a
loan
to
be
repaid
in
dollar
.
i
recommend
that
we
make
it
possibl
for
those
nation
to
continu
to
obtain
war

in
the
unit
state
,
fit
their
order
into

if

take

of

consid
what
is
best
for
our

we
are
free
to
decid
how
much
should
be
kept
here
and
how
much
should
be
sent
abroad
to
our
friend
who
by
their
determin
and
heroic
resist
are
give
us
time
in
which
to
make
readi
our
own
defens

for
what
we
send
abroad
,
we
shall
be

within
a

follow

of

at

option

in
other
good
of
mani
kind
,
which
they
can
produc
and
which
we
need

let
us
say
to
the
democraci
:
``
we
american
are
vital
concern
in
your

of

.
we
are
put

our

we
shall
send
you
,
in
ever-increas
number
,
ship
,
plane
,
tank
,
gun
.
thi
is
our
purpos
and
our
pledg
.
''
in
fulfil
of
thi
purpos
we
will
not
be
intimid
by
the
threat
of
dictat
that
they
will
regard
as
a
breach
of
intern
law
or
as
an
act
of
war
our
aid
to
the
democraci
which
dare
to
resist
their
aggress
.
such
aid
is
not
an
act
of
war
,
even
if
a
dictat
should
unilater
proclaim
it
so
to
be
.
when
the
dictat
,
if
the
dictat
,
are
readi
to
make
war
upon
us
,
they
will
not
wait
for
an
act
of
war
on
our
part
.
they
did
not
wait
for
norway
or
belgium
or
the
netherland
to
commit
an
act
of
war
.
their
onli
interest
is
in
a
new
one-way
intern
law
,
which
lack
mutual
in
it
observ
,
and
,
therefor
,
becom
an
instrument
of
oppress
.
the
happi
of
futur
gener
of
american
may
well
depend
upon
how
effect
and
how
immedi
we
can
make
our
aid
felt

no
one
can
tell
the
exact
charact
of
the
emerg

we
may
be
call
upon

a

not

within

the
best
way
of
deal
with
the
few
slacker

troubl
maker
in
our

is
,
first
,
to

those

must
have

the

take
great

much
strength
from

which
have
been
done
to
make
it
peopl
consciou
of
their
individu
stake
in
the
preserv

in

those

have
toughen

peopl
,
have
renew
their
faith
and
strengthen
their
devot
to
the
institut
we
make
readi
to
protect
.
certainli
thi
is
no
time
for
ani
of
us
to
stop
think
about
the
social
and
econom
problem
which
are
the
root
caus
of
the
social
revolut
which
is
today
a
suprem
factor
in
the
world
.
for
there
is
noth
mysteri
about
the
foundat
of
a
healthi
and
strong
democraci
.
the
basic
thing
expect
by
our
peopl
of
their
polit
and
econom
system
are
simpl
.
they
are
:
equal
of
opportun
for
youth
and
for
other
.
job
for
those
who
can
work
.
secur
for
those
who
need
it
.
the
end
of
special
privileg
for
the
few
.
the
preserv
of
civil
liberti
for
all
.
the
enjoy
of
the
fruit
of
scientif
progress
in
a
wider
and
constantli
rise
standard
of
live
.
these
are
the
simpl
,
basic
thing
that
must
never
be
lost
sight
of
in
the
turmoil
and
unbeliev
complex
of
our
modern
world
.
the
inner
and
abid
strength
of
our
econom
and
polit
system
is
depend
upon
the
degre
to
which
they
fulfil
these
expect

mani
subject
connect
with
our
social
economi
call
for
immedi

as
exampl
:
we
should
bring
more
citizen
under
the
coverag
of
old-ag
pension
and
unemploy

.
we
should
widen
the
opportun

adequ

.
we
should
plan
a
better

by
which

i
have
call
for

i
am
assur
of
the
willing
of
almost
all
american
to
respond
to
that
call
.
a
part
of
the
sacrific
mean
the
payment
of
more
money
in
tax

in
my
budget
messag
i
shall
recommend
that
a
greater
portion
of
thi
great
defens
program
be
paid
for
from
taxat
than
we
are
pay
today
.
no
person
should
tri

be
allow
,
to
get
rich
out
of
thi
program
;
and
the
principl
of
tax
payment
in
accord
with
abil
to
pay
should
be
constantli
befor
our
eye
to
guid
our

if
the

maintain
these
principl

the
voter

put

will
give
you
their
applaus

in
the
futur
day
,
which
we
seek
to
make
secur
,
we
look
forward
to
a
world
found
upon
four
essenti
human
freedom
.
the
first
is
freedom
of
speech
and
expression—everywher
in
the
world
.
the
second
is
freedom
of
everi
person
to
worship
god
in
hi
own
way—everywher
in
the
world
.
the
third
is
freedom
from
want—which
,
translat

term
,
mean
econom
understand
which
will
secur
to
everi
nation
a
healthi
peacetim
life
for
it
inhabitants-everywher
in
the
world
.
the
fourth
is
freedom
from
fear—which
,
translat
into
world
term
,
mean
a
world-wid
reduct
of
armament
to
such
a
point
and
in
such
a
thorough
fashion
that
no
nation
will
be
in
a
posit
to
commit
an
act
of
physic
aggress
against
ani
neighbor—anywher
in
the
world
.
that
is
no
vision
of
a
distant
millennium
.
it
is
a
definit
basi
for
a
kind
of
world
attain
in
our
own
time
and
gener

that
kind
of
world
is
the
veri
antithesi
of
the
so-cal
new
order
of
tyranni
which
the
dictat
seek
to
creat
with
the
crash
of
a
bomb
.
to
that
new
order
we
oppos
the
greater
conception—th
moral

a

of

without
fear

sinc
the
begin
of
our
american
histori

we
have
been
engag

a
perpetu

on
steadili

quietli
adjust
itself
to
chang
conditions—without
the
concentr
camp
or
the
quick-lim

the
world
order
which
we
seek
is
the
cooper
of
free
countri
,
work
togeth
in
a
friendli

civil
societi
.
thi
nation
ha
place
it
destini
in
the
hand
and
head
and
heart
of
it
million
of
free
men
and
women

and

our
