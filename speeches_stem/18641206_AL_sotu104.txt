ha
ventur

there

much

the
proper

but
on
the
distinct

the

have
shown
their

there
is
no

the
fact
that

so
much
is
shown

it

not

to

how
the

been

to
show
that
it

have
been
greater
but
for

true

the
import
fact
remain
demonstr
that
we

more

that

the

is
unchang

and
,
as
we
believ

unchang

the
manner
of
continu
the
effort
remain
to
choos
.
on
care
consider
of
all
the
evid
access
it
seem
to
me
that
no
attempt
at
negoti
with
the
insurg
leader
could
result
in
ani
good
.
he
would
accept
noth
short
of
sever

precis
what
we
will
not

hi

he

he

no

he
can
not

we
can
not

yield

.
between
him
and
us
the
issu
is
distinct
,
simpl
,
and
inflex

it
is
an
issu
which
can
onli
be
tri
by

decid
by

.
if
we
yield

we
are

if
the
southern
peopl
fail

,
he
is

either
way
it
would
be
the

follow

what
is
true
,
howev

of
him
who

they

the
