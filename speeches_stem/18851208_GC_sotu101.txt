so
if

we
may
reason
expect
that

it
equival
will
abandon

thi

a

been
made
by
the

soon

to
the

that

not

desir

,
and
thi
,
with
the
evid
disposit

give
rise

the
suspicion
that
there

a
lack

there
is
certainli
not

and
the
whole

now

might
after
a

be
absorb

but
it
is
the

that
threaten

unconnect
with
the

which
the

but
it
is
perfectli
appar
that
a

convinc

among

exist
the

differ

the

the

there
are
those
whose

the

a
consider
of
the
fact
that
the
librari
of
the
capitol
ha
twice
been
destroy
or
damag
by
fire
,
it

and
it

of

under

law
relat

make
manifest
the
necess
of
prompt
action
to
insur
it
proper
accommod
and
protect
.
my
attent
ha
been
call
to
a
controversi
which
ha
arisen
from
the
condit
of
the
law
relat
to
railroad
facil
in
the
citi
of
washington
,
which
ha
involv
the
commission
of
the
district
in
much
annoy
and
troubl
.
i
hope
thi
difficulti
will
be
promptli
settl
by
appropri
legisl
.
the
commission
repres
that
enough
of
the
revenu
of
the
district
are
now
on
deposit
in
the
treasuri
of
the
unit
state
to
repay
the
sum
advanc
by
the
govern
for
sewer
improv
under
the
act
of
june
30
,
1884
.
they
desir
now
an
advanc
of
the
share
which
ultim
should
be
born
by
the
district
of
the
cost
of
extens
improv
to
the
street
of
the
citi
.
the
total
expens
of
these
contempl
improv
is
estim
at
$
1,000,000
,
and
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
a
consider
sum
could
be
save
if
they
had
all
the
money
in
hand
,
so
that
contract
for
the
whole
work
could
be
made
at
the
same
time
.
they
express
confid
that
if
the
advanc
ask
for
should
be
made
the
govern
would
be
reimburs
the
same
within
a
reason
time
.
i
have
no
doubt
that
these
improv
could
be
made
much
cheaper
if
undertaken
togeth
and
prosecut
accord
to
a
gener
plan
.
the
licens
law
now
in
forc
within
the
district
is
defici
and
uncertain
in
some
of
it
provis
and
ought
to
be
amend
.
the
commission
urg
,
with
good
reason
,
the
necess
of
provid
a
build
for
the
use
of
the
district
govern
which
shall
better
secur
the
safeti
and
preserv
of
it
valuabl
book
and
record
.
the
present
condit
of
the
law
relat
to
the
success
to
the
presid
in
the
event
of
the
death
,
disabl
,
or
remov
of
both
the
presid
and
vice-presid
is
such
as
to
requir
immedi
amend
.
thi
subject
ha
repeatedli
been
consid
by
congress
,
but
no
result
ha
been
reach
.
the
recent
lament
death
of
the
vice-presid
,
and
vacanc
at
the
same
time
in
all
other
offic
the
incumb
of
which
might
immedi
exercis
the
function
of
the
presidenti
offic
,
ha
caus
public
anxieti
and
a
just
demand
that
a
recurr
of
such
a
condit
of
affair
should
not
be
permit
.
in
conclus
i
commend
to
the
wise
care
and
thought
attent
of
congress
the
need
,
the
welfar
,
and
the
aspir
of
an
intellig

gener
nation
.
to
subordin
these
to
the
narrow
advantag
of
partisanship
or
the
accomplish
of
selfish
aim
is
to
violat
the
peopl
's
trust
and
betray
the
peopl

;
but
an
individu
sens
of
respons
on
the
part
of
each
of

and
a
stern
determin
to
perform
our
