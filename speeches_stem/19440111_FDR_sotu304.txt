to
the
congress
:
thi
nation
in
the
past
two
year
ha
becom
an
activ
partner
in
the
world
's
greatest
war
against
human
slaveri
.
we
have
join
with
like-mind
peopl
in
order
to
defend
ourselv
in
a
world
that
ha
been
grave
threaten
with
gangster
rule
.
but
i
do
not
think
that
ani
of
us
american
can
be
content
with
mere
surviv
.
sacrific
that
we
and
our
alli
are
make
impos
upon
us
all
a
sacr
oblig
to
see
to
it
that
out
of
thi
war
we
and
our
children
will
gain
someth
better
than
mere
surviv
.
we
are
unit
in
determin
that
thi
war
shall
not
be
follow
by
anoth
interim
which
lead
to
new
disaster-
that
we
shall
not
repeat
the
tragic
error
of
ostrich
isolationism—that
we
shall
not
repeat
the
excess
of
the
wild
twenti
when
thi
nation
went
for
a
joy
ride
on
a
roller
coaster
which
end
in
a
tragic
crash
.
when
mr
.
hull
went
to
moscow
in
octob
,
and
when
i
went
to
cairo
and
teheran
in
novemb
,
we
knew
that
we
were
in
agreement
with
our
alli
in
our
common
determin
to
fight
and
win
thi
war
.
but
there
were
mani
vital
question
concern
the
futur
peac
,
and
they
were
discuss
in
an
atmospher
of
complet
candor
and
harmoni
.
in
the
last
war
such
discuss
,
such
meet
,
did
not
even
begin
until
the
shoot
had
stop
and
the
deleg
began
to
assembl
at
the
peac
tabl
.
there
had
been
no
previou
opportun
for
man-to-man
discuss
which
lead
to
meet
of
mind
.
the
result
wa
a
peac
which
wa
not
a
peac
.
that
wa
a
mistak
which
we
are
not
repeat
in
thi
war
.
and
right
here
i
want
to
address
a
word
or
two
to
some
suspici
soul
who
are
fear
that
mr
.
hull
or
i
have
made
``
commit
''
for
the
futur
which
might
pledg
thi
nation
to
secret
treati
,
or
to
enact
the
role
of
santa
clau
.
to
such
suspici
souls—us
a
polit
terminology—i
wish
to
say
that
mr.
churchil
,
and
marshal
stalin
,
and
generalissimo
chiang
kai-shek
are
all
thoroughli
convers
with
the
provis
of
our
constitut
.
and
so
is
mr
.
hull
.
and
so
am
i
.
of
cours
we
made
some
commit
.
we
most
certainli
commit
ourselv
to
veri
larg
and
veri
specif
militari
plan
which
requir
the
use
of
all
alli
forc
to
bring
about
the
defeat
of
our
enemi
at
the
earliest
possibl
time
.
but
there
were
no
secret
treati
or
polit
or
financi
commit
.
the
one
suprem
object
for
the
futur
,
which
we
discuss
for
each
nation
individu
,
and
for
all
the
unit
nation
,
can
be
sum
up
in
one
word
:
secur
.
and
that
mean
not
onli
physic
secur
which
provid
safeti
from
attack
by
aggressor
.
it
mean
also
econom
secur
,
social
secur
,
moral
security—in
a
famili
of
nation
.
in
the
plain
down-to-earth
talk
that
i
had
with
the
generalissimo
and
marshal
stalin
and
prime
minist
churchil
,
it
wa
abundantli
clear
that
they
are
all
most
deepli
interest
in
the
resumpt
of
peac
progress
by
their
own
peoples—progress
toward
a
better
life
.
all
our
alli
want
freedom
to
develop
their
land
and
resourc
,
to
build
up
industri
,
to
increas
educ
and
individu
opportun
,
and
to
rais
standard
of
live
.
all
our
alli
have
learn
by
bitter
experi
that
real
develop
will
not
be
possibl
if
they
are
to
be
divert
from
their
purpos
by
repeat
wars—or
even
threat
of
war
.
china
and
russia
are
truli
unit
with
britain
and
america
in
recognit
of
thi
essenti
fact
:
the
best
interest
of
each
nation
,
larg
and
small
,
demand
that
all
freedom-lov
nation
shall
join
togeth
in
a
just
and
durabl
system
of
peac
.
in
the
present

evidenc
by
the
action
of
germani

,
unquest

control
over

of
the
peac
is
as
necessari
among

as
it
is
among

and
an
equal

essenti
to
peac
is
a
decent
standard
of

for
all
individu

in

freedom
from

is
etern
link
with
freedom
from

.
there
are
peopl
who
burrow
through
our
nation
like
unse
mole
,
and
attempt
to
spread
the
suspicion
that
if
other
nation
are
encourag
to
rais
their
standard
of

,
our
own
american
standard
of

must
of
necess
be
depress

the
fact
is
the
veri
contrari
.
it
ha
been
shown
time

again
that
if
the
standard
of

of
ani

goe
up

so
doe
it

and
that
such
a
rise
encourag
a
better
standard
of

in

countri
with

it

that
is
just
plain
common
sense—and
it
is
the
kind
of
plain

that
provid
the
basi
for

return
from
my

,
i
must
confess
to
a
sens
of
``
let-down
''
when
i
found
mani
evid
of
faulti
perspect

in

.
the
faulti

consist
in
overemphas
lesser
problem
and
therebi
underemphas
the
first
and
greatest
problem
.
the
overwhelm
major
of
our
peopl
have
met
the
demand
of
thi
war
with
magnific
courag
and
understand
.
they
have
accept
inconveni
;
they
have
accept
hardship
;
they
have
accept
tragic
sacrific
.
and
they
are
readi
and
eager
to
make
whatev
further
contribut
are
need
to
win
the
war
as
quickli
as
possible-
if
onli
they
are
given
the
chanc
to
know
what
is
requir
of
them
.
howev
,
while
the
major
goe
on
about
it
great
work
without
complaint
,
a
noisi
minor
maintain
an
uproar
of
demand
for
special

for
special

.
there
are
pest
who
swarm
through
the
lobbi
of
the

and
the
cocktail
bar
of
washington
,
repres
these
special
group
as
oppos
to
the
basic
interest
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
.
they
have
come
to
look
upon
the
war
primarili
as
a
chanc
to
make
profit
for
themselv
at
the
expens
of
their
neighbors-
profit
in
money
or
in
term
of
polit
or

such
selfish

be

in

it

it

it

if

we
can
not

the
fact
that
in
our
past
we
have
not
alway
forgotten
individu

selfish
and
partisan
interest
in
time
of

have
not
alway
been

we
can
not
overlook
the
seriou
dissens
and
the
lack
of

in
our

of
the
revolut

in
our

of

in

in

i
recommend
that
the
congress
adopt
:
(

a
realist
tax
law—which
will
tax
all
unreason
profit
,
both
individu

and
reduc
the

of

the

doe
not

test
.
(

)
a
continu
of
the
law
for
the
renegoti
of
war
contracts—which
will
prevent
exorbit
profit
and
assur
fair
price
to
the
govern
.
for
two
long
year
i
have
plead
with
the
congress
to
take
undu
profit
out
of
war
.
(

)
a
cost
of
food
law—which
will
enabl
the
govern
(
a
)
to
place
a
reason
floor
under
the
price
the
farmer
may
expect
for
hi

and

to

a

i
would
not

as
you
know

i
have
for
three
year
hesit
to
recommend
a
nation

act

today
,
howev
,
i
am
convinc
of
it
necess
.
although
i
believ
that
we
and
our
alli
can
win
the
war
without
such
a
measur
,
i
am
certain
that
noth
less
than
total
mobil
of
all
our
resourc
of
manpow
and
capit
will
guarante
an
earlier
victori
,
and
reduc
the
toll
of
suffer
and
sorrow
and
blood
.
i
have
receiv
a
joint
recommend
for
thi
law
from
the
head
of
the
war
depart
,
the
navi
depart
,
and
the
maritim
commiss
.
these
are
the
men
who
bear
respons
for
the
procur
of
the
necessari
arm
and
equip
,
and
for
the
success
prosecut
of
the
war
in
the
field
.
they
say
:
``
when
the
veri
life
of
the
nation
is
in
peril
the
respons
for
servic
is
common
to
all
men
and

.
in
such
a
time
there
can
be
no
discrimin
between
the
men
and
women
who
are
assign
by
the
govern
to
it
defens
at
the
battlefront
and
the
men
and

assign
to

the

essenti

.
a
prompt
enact
of
a
nation
servic
law
would
be
mere
an
express
of
the
univers
of
thi
respons
.
''
i
believ
the
countri
will
agre
that
those
statement
are
the
solemn
truth
.
nation
servic
is
the
most
democrat
way
to
wage
a

.
like

it

it

it

my
convict
that

welcom

is
base

it

recogn

no

we
have

so
to

a

under

a
new

of
secur
and
prosper
can
be
establish

among
these
are
:
the

ask
