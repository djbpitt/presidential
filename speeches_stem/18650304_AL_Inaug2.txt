fellow-countrymen
:
at
thi
second
appear
to
take
the
oath
of
the
presidenti
offic
there
is
less
occas
for
an
extend
address
than
there
wa
at
the
first
.
then
a
statement
somewhat
in
detail
of
a
cours
to
be
pursu
seem
fit
and
proper
.
now
,
at
the
expir
of
four
year

dure
which
public

forth
on
everi
point
and
phase
of
the
great
contest
which
still
absorb
the
attent
and
engross
the
energi
of
the
nation
,
littl
that
is
new
could
be
present
.
the
progress
of
our
arm
,
upon
which
all
els
chiefli
depend
,
is
as
well
known
to
the
public
as
to
myself
,
and
it
is
,
i
trust
,
reason
satisfactori
and
encourag
to
all
.
with
high
hope
for
the
futur
,
no
predict
in
regard
to
it
is
ventur
.
on
the
occas
correspond
to
thi
four
year
ago
all
thought
were
anxious
direct
to
an
impend
civil
war
.
all
dread
it
,
all
sought
to
avert
it
.
while
the
inaugur
address
wa
be
deliv
from
thi
place
,
devot
altogeth
to
save
the
union
without
war
,
insurg
agent
were
in
the
citi
seek
to
destroy
it
without
war-seek
to
dissolv
the
union
and
divid
effect
by
negoti
.
both
parti
deprec
war
,
but
one
of
them
would
make
war
rather
than
let
the
nation
surviv
,
and
the
other
would
accept
war
rather
than
let
it
perish
,
and
the
war
came
.
one-eighth
of
the
whole
popul
were
color
slave
,
not
distribut
gener
over
the
union
.
but
local
in
the
southern
part
of
it
.
these
slave
constitut
a
peculiar
and
power
interest
.
all
knew
that
thi
interest
wa
somehow
the
caus
of
the
war
.
to
strengthen
,
perpetu
,
and
extend
thi
interest
wa
the
object
for
which
the
insurg
would
rend
the
union
even
by
war
,
while
the
govern
claim
no
right
to
do
more
than
to
restrict
the
territori
enlarg
of
it
.
neither
parti
expect
for
the
war
the
magnitud
or
the
durat
which
it
ha
alreadi
attain

neither
anticip
that
the
caus
of
the
conflict
might
ceas
with
or
even
befor
the
conflict
itself
should
ceas
.
each
look
for
an
easier
triumph
,
and
a
result
less
fundament
and
astound
.
both
read
the
same
bibl
and
pray
to
the
same
god
,
and
each
invok
hi
aid
against
the
other
.
it
may
seem
strang
that
ani
men
should
dare
to
ask
a
just
god
's
assist
in
wring
their
bread
from
the
sweat
of
other
men
's
face
,
but
let
us
judg
not
,
that
we
be
not
judg
.
the
prayer
of
both
could
not
be
answer
.
that
of
neither
ha
been
answer
fulli
.
the
almighti

``
woe
unto
the
world
becaus
of

for
it
must
need
be
that

but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the

if
we

in

and
that

south
thi

as
the

due

those
by

shall

that

if

that
it

of

shall

until

of

drawn
with
the
lash
shall
be
paid
by
anoth
drawn
with
the
sword
,
as
wa
said
three
thousand
year
ago
,
so
still
it
must
be
said
``
the
judgment

true

righteou
altogeth

''
with
malic
toward
none
,
with
chariti
for
all
,
with
firm
in
the
fight
as
god
give
us
to
see
the
right
,
let
us
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in
,
to
bind
up
the
nation'
wound
,
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have

to
