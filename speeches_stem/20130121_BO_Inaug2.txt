and
fellow
citizen
:
each
time
we
gather
to
inaugur
a
presid
we
bear
wit
to
the
endur
strength
of
our
constitut
.
we
affirm
the
promis
of
our
democraci
.
we
recal
that
what
bind
thi
nation
togeth
is
not
the
color
of
our
skin
or
the
tenet
of
our
faith
or
the
origin
of
our
name
.
what
make
us
exceptional—what
make
us
american—i
our
allegi
to
an
idea
articul
in
a
declar
made
more
than
two
centuri
ago
:
we
hold
these
truth
to
be
self-evid
,
that
all
men
are
creat
equal
;
that
they
are
endow
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalien
right
;
that
among
these
are
life
,
liberti
,
and
the
pursuit
of
happi
.
today
we
continu
a
never-end
journey
to
bridg
the
mean
of
those
word
with
the
realiti
of
our
time
.
for
histori
tell
us
that
while
these
truth
may
be
self-evid
,
they
've
never
been
self-execut
;
that
while
freedom
is
a
gift
from
god
,
it
must
be
secur
by
hi
peopl
here
on
earth
.
the
patriot
of
1776
did
not
fight
to
replac
the
tyranni
of
a
king
with
the
privileg
of
a
few
or
the
rule
of
a
mob
.
they
gave
to
us
a
republ
,
a
govern
of
and
by
and
for
the
peopl
,
entrust
each
gener
to
keep
safe
our
found
creed
.
and
for
more
than
200
year
,
we
have
.
through
blood
drawn
by
lash
and
blood
drawn
by
sword
,
we
learn
that
no
union
found
on
the
principl
of
liberti
and
equal
could
surviv
half-slav
and
half-fre
.
we
made
ourselv
anew
,
and
vow
to
move
forward
togeth
.
togeth
,
we
determin
that
a
modern
economi
requir
railroad
and
highway
to
speed
travel
and
commerc
,
school
and
colleg
to
train
our
worker
.
togeth
,
we
discov
that
a
free
market
onli
thrive
when
there
are
rule
to
ensur
competit
and
fair
play
.
togeth
,
we
resolv
that
a
great
nation
must
care
for
the
vulner
and
protect
it
peopl
from
life
's
worst
hazard
and
misfortun
.
through
it
all
,
we
have
never
relinquish
our
skeptic
of
central
author
nor
have
we
succumb
to
the
fiction
that
all
societi
's
ill
can
be
cure
through
govern
alon
.
our
celebr
of
initi
and
enterpris
,
our
insist
on
hard
work
and
person
respons
,
these
are
constant
in
our
charact
.
but
we
have
alway
understood
that
when
time
chang
,
so
must
we
;
that
fidel
to
our
found
principl
requir
new
respons
to
new
challeng
;
that
preserv
our
individu
freedom
ultim
requir
collect
action
.
for
the
american
peopl
can
no
more
meet
the
demand
of
today
's
world
by
act
alon
than
american
soldier
could
have
met
the
forc
of
fascism
or
commun
with
musket
and
militia
.
no
singl
person
can
train
all
the
math
and
scienc
teacher
we
'll
need
to
equip
our
children
for
the
futur
,
or
build
the
road
and
network
and
research
lab
that
will
bring
new
job
and
busi
to
our
shore
.
now
more
than
ever
,
we
must
do
these
thing
togeth
,
as
one
nation
and
one
peopl
.
thi
gener
of
american
ha
been
test
by
crise
that
steel
our
resolv
and
prove
our
resili
.
a
decad
of
war
is
now
end
.
an
econom
recoveri
ha
begun
.
america
's
possibl
are
limitless
,
for
we
possess
all
the
qualiti
that
thi
world
without
boundari
demand
:
youth
and
drive
;
divers
and
open
;
an
endless
capac
for
risk
and
a
gift
for
reinvent
.
my
fellow
american
,
we
are
made
for
thi
moment
and
we
will
seiz
it—so
long
as
we
seiz
it
togeth
.
for
we
,
the
peopl
,
understand
that
our
countri
can
not
succeed
when
a
shrink
few
do
veri
well
and
a
grow
mani
bare
make
it
.
we
believ
that
america
's
prosper
must
rest
upon
the
broad
shoulder
of
a
rise
middl
class
.
we
know
that
america
thrive
when
everi
person
can
find
independ
and
pride
in
their
work
;
when
the
wage
of
honest
labor
liber
famili
from
the
brink
of
hardship
.
we
are
true
to
our
creed
when
a
littl
girl
born
into
the
bleakest
poverti
know
that
she
ha
the
same
chanc
to
succeed
as
anybodi
els
,
becaus
she
is
an
american
;
she
is
free
and
she
is
equal
,
not
just
in
the
eye
of
god
,
but
also
in
our
own
.
we
understand
that
outworn
program
are
inadequ
to
the
need
of
our
time
.
so
we
must
har
new
idea
and
technolog
to
remak
our
govern
,
revamp
our
tax
code
,
reform
our
school
,
and
empow
our
citizen
with
the
skill
they
need
to
work
harder
,
learn
more
,
reach
higher
.
but
while
the
mean
will
chang
,
our
purpos
endur
:
a
nation
that
reward
the
effort
and
determin
of
everi
singl
american
.
that
is
what
thi
moment
requir
.
that
is
what
will
give
real
mean
to
our
creed
.
we
,
the
peopl
,
still
believ
that
everi
citizen
deserv
a
basic
measur
of
secur
and
digniti
.
we
must
make
the
hard
choic
to
reduc
the
cost
of
health
care
and
the
size
of
our
deficit
.
but
we
reject
the
belief
that
america
must
choos
between
care
for
the
gener
that
built
thi
countri
and
invest
in
the
gener
that
will
build
it
futur
.
for
we
rememb
the
lesson
of
our
past
,
when
twilight
year
were
spent
in
poverti
and
parent
of
a
child
with
a
disabl
had
nowher
to
turn
.
we
do
not
believ
that
in
thi
countri
freedom
is
reserv
for
the
lucki
,
or
happi
for
the
few
.
we
recogn
that
no
matter
how
respons
we
live
our
live
,
ani
one
of
us
at
ani
time
may
face
a
job
loss
or
a
sudden
ill
or
a
home
swept
away
in
a
terribl
storm
.
the
commit
we
make
to
each
other
through
medicar
and
medicaid
and
social
secur
,
these
thing
do
not
sap
our
initi
,
they
strengthen
us
.
they
do
not
make
us
a
nation
of
taker
;
they
free
us
to
take
the
risk
that
make
thi
countri
great
.
we
,
the
peopl
,
still
believ
that
our
oblig
as
american
are
not
just
to
ourselv
,
but
to
all
poster
.
we
will
respond
to
the
threat
of
climat
chang
,
know
that
the
failur
to
do
so
would
betray
our
children
and
futur
gener
.
some
may
still
deni
the
overwhelm
judgment
of
scienc
,
but
none
can
avoid
the
devast
impact
of
rage
fire
and
crippl
drought
and
more
power
storm
.
the
path
toward
sustain
energi
sourc
will
be
long
and
sometim
difficult
.
but
america
can
not
resist
thi
transit
,
we
must
lead
it
.
we
can
not
cede
to
other
nation
the
technolog
that
will
power
new
job
and
new
industri
,
we
must
claim
it
promis
.
that
's
how
we
will
maintain
our
econom
vital
and
our
nation
treasure—our
forest
and
waterway
,
our
crop
land
and
snow-cap
peak
.
that
is
how
we
will
preserv
our
planet
,
command
to
our
care
by
god
.
that
's
what
will
lend
mean
to
the
creed
our
father
onc
declar
.
we
,
the
peopl
,
still
believ
that
endur
secur
and
last
peac
do
not
requir
perpetu
war
.
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
,
temper
by
the
flame
of
battl
,
are
unmatch
in
skill
and
courag
.
our
citizen
,
sear
by
the
memori
of
those
we
have
lost
,
know
too
well
the
price
that
is
paid
for
liberti
.
the
knowledg
of
their
sacrific
will
keep
us
forev
vigil
against
those
who
would
do
us
harm
.
but
we
are
also
heir
to
those
who
won
the
peac
and
not
just
the
war
;
who
turn
sworn
enemi
into
the
surest
of
friends—and
we
must
carri
those
lesson
into
thi
time
as
well
.
we
will
defend
our
peopl
and
uphold
our
valu
through
strength
of
arm
and
rule
of
law
.
we
will
show
the
courag
to
tri
and
resolv
our
differ
with
other
nation
peacefully—not
becaus
we
are
naiv
about
the
danger
we
face
,
but
becaus
engag
can
more
durabl
lift
suspicion
and
fear
.
america
will
remain
the
anchor
of
strong
allianc
in
everi
corner
of
the
globe
.
and
we
will
renew
those
institut
that
extend
our
capac
to
manag
crisi
abroad
,
for
no
one
ha
a
greater
stake
in
a
peac
world
than
it
most
power
nation
.
we
will
support
democraci
from
asia
to
africa
,
from
the
america
to
the
middl
east
,
becaus
our
interest
and
our
conscienc
compel
us
to
act
on
behalf
of
those
who
long
for
freedom
.
and
we
must
be
a
sourc
of
hope
to
the
poor
,
the
sick
,
the
margin
,
the
victim
of
prejudice—not
out
of
mere
chariti
,
but
becaus
peac
in
our
time
requir
the
constant
advanc
of
those
principl
that
our
common
creed
describ
:
toler

opportun

human

we
,
the

declar
today
that
the

who
left

along

to

the
