unwil
to
depart
from

of

i
avail
myself
of
the
occas
now
present
to
express
the
profound
impress
made
on
me
by
the
call
of
my
countri
to
the
station
to
the
duti
of
which
i
am
about
to
pledg
myself
by
the
most
solemn
of
sanction
.
so
distinguish
a
mark
of
confid
,
proceed
from
the
deliber
and
tranquil
suffrag
of
a
free
and
virtuou
nation
,
would
under

circumst
have
command
my
gratitud
and
devot
,
as
well
as
fill
me
with
an
aw
sens
of
the
trust
to
be
assum
.
under
the
variou
circumst
which
give
peculiar
solemn
to
the
exist
period
,
i
feel
that
both
the
honor
and
the
respons
allot
to
me
are
inexpress
enhanc
.
the
present
situat
of
the
world
is
inde
without
a
parallel
and
that
of
our
own
countri
full
of
difficulti
.
the
pressur
of
these
,
too
,
is
the
more
sever
felt
becaus
they
have
fallen
upon
us
at
a
moment
when
the
nation
prosper
be
at
a
height
not

the
contrast

from

the
more

under

the

of

in
an
unriv
growth
of

proof
of
thi
were
seen
in
the
improv
of

,
in
the

of

in

in

,
and
in
the
valuabl
work

everywher

it
is
a
preciou
reflect
that
the
transit
from
thi

to
the
scene
which
ha
for

,
as
i

on

error
in

indulg
no
passion
which
trespass
on
the
right
or
the
repos
of

,
it
ha
been
the
true
glori
of
the

to

and
to

themselv
to
the

if
there
be
candor
in

world
,
the
truth
of
these
assert

not
be

poster
at

will
do

thi
unexception

could
not

the

assur
