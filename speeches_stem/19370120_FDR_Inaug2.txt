when
four
year
ago
we
met
to
inaugur
presid
,
the
republ
,
single-mind
in
anxieti
,
stood
in
spirit
here
.
we
dedic
ourselv
to
the
fulfil
of
a
vision—to
speed
the
time
when
there
would
be
for
all
the
peopl
that
secur
and
peac
essenti
to
the
pursuit
of
happi
.
we
of
the
republ
pledg
ourselv
to
drive
from
the
templ
of
our
ancient
faith
those
who
had
profan
it
;
to
end
by
action
,
tireless
and
unafraid
,
the
stagnat
and
despair
of
that
day
.
we
did
those
first
thing
first
.
our
coven
with
ourselv
did
not
stop
there
.
instinct
we
recogn
a
deeper
need—th
need
to
find
through
govern
the
instrument
of
our
unit
purpos
to
solv
for
the
individu
the
ever-ris
problem
of
a
complex
civil
.
repeat
attempt
at
their
solut
without
the
aid
of
govern
had
left
us
baffl
and
bewild
.
for
,
without
that
aid
,
we
had
been
unabl
to
creat
those
moral
control
over
the
servic
of
scienc
which
are
necessari
to
make
scienc
a
use
servant
instead
of
a
ruthless
master
of
mankind
.
to
do
thi
we
knew
that
we
must
find
practic
control
over
blind
econom
forc
and
blindli
selfish
men
.
we
of
the
republ
sens
the
truth
that
democrat
govern
ha
innat
capac
to
protect
it
peopl
against
disast
onc
consid
inevit
,
to
solv
problem
onc
consid
unsolv
.
we
would
not
admit
that
we
could
not
find
a
way
to
master
econom
epidem
just
as
,
after
centuri
of
fatalist
suffer
,
we
had
found
a
way
to
master
epidem
of
diseas
.
we
refus
to
leav
the
problem
of
our
common
welfar
to
be
solv
by
the
wind
of
chanc
and
the
hurrican
of
disast
.
in
thi
we
american
were
discov
no
wholli
new
truth
;
we
were
write
a
new
chapter
in
our
book
of
self-govern
.
thi
year
mark
the
one
hundr
and
fiftieth
anniversari
of
the
constitut
convent
which
made
us
a
nation
.
at
that
convent
our
forefath
found
the
way
out
of
the
chao
which
follow
the
revolutionari
war
;
they
creat
a
strong
govern
with
power
of
unit
action
suffici
then
and
now
to
solv
problem
utterli
beyond
individu
or
local
solut
.
a
centuri
and
a
half
ago
they
establish
the
feder
govern
in
order
to
promot
the
gener
welfar
and
secur
the
bless
of
liberti
to
the
american
peopl
.
today
we
invok
those
same
power
of
govern
to
achiev
the
same
object
.
four
year
of
new
experi
have
not
beli
our
histor
instinct
.
they
hold
out
the
clear
hope
that
govern
within
commun
,
govern
within
the
separ
state
,
and
govern
of
the
unit
state
can
do
the
thing
the
time
requir
,
without
yield
it
democraci
.
our
task
in
the
last
four
year
did
not
forc
democraci
to
take
a
holiday
.
nearli
all
of
us
recogn
that
as
intricaci
of
human
relationship
increas
,
so
power
to
govern
them
also
must
increas
power
to
stop
evil
;
power
to
do
good
.
the
essenti
democraci
of
our
nation
and
the
safeti
of
our
peopl
depend
not
upon
the
absenc
of
power
,
but
upon
lodg
it
with
those
whom
the
peopl
can
chang
or
continu
at
state
interv
through
an
honest
and
free
system
of
elect
.
the
constitut
of
1787
did
not
make
our
democraci
impot
.
in
fact
,
in
these
last
four
year
,
we
have
made
the
exercis
of
all
power
more
democrat
;
for
we
have
begun
to
bring
privat
autocrat
power
into
their
proper
subordin
to
the
public
's
govern
.
the
legend
that
they
were
invinc
abov
and
beyond
the
process
of
a
democraci
ha
been
shatter
.
they
have
been
challeng
and
beaten
.
our
progress
out
of
the
depress
is
obviou
.
but
that
is
not
all
that
you
and
i

by

our

not

to

by

we
have
undertaken
to
erect
on
the
old

the

in

we
have
alway

that

we
know
now
that
it
is

out
of

of
a

whose

their

ha
come
the
convict

in

we
are
begin
to
wipe
out
the
line
that
divid
the

from

ideal
;
and
in
so
do
we
are
fashion
an
instrument
of

the

of

.
thi

the

we
are
begin
to
abandon
our

by
those
who
betray
for

the

we

but
we
realiz
that
there
can
be
no
era
of

save
among
men
of

for
these
reason
i
am
justifi

that
the

let
us
ask
again
:
have
we
reach
the
goal
of
our
vision
of
that
fourth
day
of
march
,
1933
?
have
we
found
our
happi
valley
?
i
see
a
great
nation
,
upon
a
great
contin
,
bless
with
a
great
wealth
of
natur
resourc
.
it
hundr
and
thirti
million
peopl
are
at
peac
among
themselv
;
they
are
make
their
countri
a
good
neighbor
among
the
nation
.
i
see
a
unit
state
which
can
demonstr
that
,
under
democrat
method
of
govern
,
nation
wealth
can
be
translat
into
a
spread
volum
of
human
comfort
hitherto
unknown
,
and
the
lowest
standard
of
live
can
be
rais
far
abov
the
level
of
mere
subsist
.
but
here
is
the
challeng
to
our
democraci
:
in
thi
nation
i
see
ten
of
million
of
it
citizens—a
substanti
part
of
it
whole
population—who
at
thi
veri
moment
are
deni
the
greater
part
of
what
the
veri
lowest
standard
of
today
call
the
necess
of
life
.
i
see
million
of
famili
tri
to
live
on
incom
so
meager
that
the
pall
of
famili
disast
hang
over
them
day
by
day
.
i
see
million
whose
daili
live
in
citi
and
on
farm
continu
under
condit
label
indec
by
a
so-cal
polit
societi
half
a
centuri
ago
.
i
see
million
deni
educ
,
recreat
,
and
the
opportun
to
better
their
lot
and
the
lot
of
their
children
.
i
see
million
lack
the
mean
to
buy
the
product
of
farm
and
factori
and
by
their
poverti
deni
work
and
product
to
mani
other
million
.
i
see
one-third
of
a
nation
ill-hous
,
ill-clad
,
ill-nourish
.
it
is
not
in
despair
that
i
paint
you
that
pictur
.
i
paint
it
for
you
in
hope—becaus
the
nation
,
see
and
understand
the
injustic
in
it
,
propos
to
paint
it
out
.
we
are
determin
to
make
everi
american
citizen
the
subject
of
hi
countri
's
interest
and
concern
;
and
we
will
never
regard
ani
faith
,
law-abid
group
within
our
border
as
superflu
.
the
test
of
our
progress
is
not
whether
we
add
more
to
the
abund
of
those
who
have
much
;
it
is
whether
we
provid
enough
for
those
who
have
too
littl
.
if
i
know
aught
of
the
spirit
and
purpos
of
our

we
will
not
listen
to

we

overwhelmingli
,
we
of

they
will
insist
that
everi

it
