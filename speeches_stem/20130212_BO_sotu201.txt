have
a
seat

mr.
speaker
,
mr.
vice
presid
,
member
of
congress
,
fellow
american
:
fifty-on
year
ago
,
john
f.
kennedi
declar
to
thi
chamber
that
``
the
constitut
make
us
not
rival
for
power
,
but
partner
for
progress
.
''
``
it
is
my
task
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
report
the
state
of
the
union
;
to
improv
it
is
the
task
of
us
all
.
''
tonight
,
thank
to
the
grit
and
determin
of
the
american
peopl
,
there
is
much
progress
to
report
.
after
a
decad
of
grind
war
,
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
are
come
home
.
after
year
of
gruel
recess
,
our
busi
have
creat
over
6
million
new
job
.
we
buy
more
american
car
than
we
have
in
5
year
and
less
foreign
oil
than
we
have
in
20
.
our
hous
market
is
heal
,
our
stock
market
is
rebound
,
and
consum
,
patient
,
and
homeown
enjoy
stronger
protect
than
ever
befor
.
so
togeth
,
we
have
clear
away
the
rubbl
of
crisi
,
and
we
can
say
with
renew
confid
that
the
state
of
our
union
is
stronger
.
but
we
gather
here
know
that
there
are
million
of
american
whose
hard
work
and
dedic
have
not
yet
been
reward
.
our
economi
is
ad
job
,
but
too
mani
peopl
still
ca
n't
find
full-tim
employ
.
corpor
profit
have
skyrocket
to
alltim
high
,
but
for
more
than
a
decad
,
wage
and
incom
have
bare
budg
.
it
is
our
gener
's
task
,
then
,
to
reignit
the
true
engin
of
america
's
econom
growth
:
a
rise
,
thrive
middl
class
.
it
is
our
unfinish
task
to
restor
the
basic
bargain
that
built
thi
countri
:
the
idea
that
if
you
work
hard
and
meet
your
respons
,
you
can
get
ahead
,
no
matter
where
you
come
from
,
no
matter
what
you
look
like
or
who
you
love
.
it
is
our
unfinish
task
to
make
sure
that
thi
govern
work
on
behalf
of
the
mani
,
and
not
just
the
few
;
that
it
encourag
free
enterpris
,
reward
individu
initi
,
and
open
the
door
of
opportun
to
everi
child
across
thi
great
nation
.
the
american
peopl
do
n't
expect
govern
to
solv
everi
problem
.
they
do
n't
expect
those
of
us
in
thi
chamber
to
agre
on
everi
issu
.
but
they
do
expect
us
to
put
the
nation
's
interest
befor
parti
.
they
do
expect
us
to
forg
reason
compromis
where
we
can
.
for
they
know
that
america
move
forward
onli
when
we
do
so
togeth
and
that
the
respons
of
improv
thi
union
remain
the
task
of
us
all
.
now
,
our
work
must
begin
by
make
some
basic
decis
about
our
budget
,
decis
that
will
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
strength
of
our
recoveri
.
over
the
last
few
year
,
both
parti
have
work
togeth
to
reduc
the
deficit
by
more
than
$
2.5
trillion
,
mostli
through
spend
cut
,
but
also
by
rais
tax
rate
on
the
wealthiest
1
percent
of
american
.
as
a
result
,
we
are
more
than
halfway
toward
the
goal
of
$
4
trillion
in
deficit
reduct
that
economist
say
we
need
to
stabil
our
financ
.
now
we
need
to
finish
the
job
.
and
the
question
is
,
how
?
in
2011
,
congress
pass
a
law
say
that
if
both
parti
could
n't
agre
on
a
plan
to
reach
our
deficit
goal
,
about
a
trillion
dollar
'
worth
of
budget
cut
would
automat
go
into
effect
thi
year
.
these
sudden
,
harsh
,
arbitrari
cut
would
jeopard
our
militari
readi
.
they
'd
devast
prioriti
like
educ
and
energi
and
medic
research
.
they
would
certainli
slow
our
recoveri
and
cost
us
hundr
of
thousand
of
job
.
and
that
's
whi
democrat
,
republican
,
busi
leader
,
and
economist
have
alreadi
said
that
these
cuts—known
here
in
washington
as
the
sequester—ar
a
realli
bad
idea
.
now
,
some
in
congress
have
propos
prevent
onli
the
defens
cut
by
make
even
bigger
cut
to
thing
like
educ
and
job
train
,
medicar
,
and
social
secur
benefit
.
that
idea
is
even
wors
.
ye
,
the
biggest
driver
of
our
long-term
debt
is
the
rise
cost
of
health
care
for
an
age
popul
.
and
those
of
us
who
care
deepli
about
program
like
medicar
must
embrac
the
need
for
modest
reform
;
otherwis
,
our
retir
program
will
crowd
out
the
invest
we
need
for
our
children
and
jeopard
the
promis
of
a
secur
retir
for
futur
gener
.
but
we
ca
n't
ask
senior
citizen
and
work
famili
to
shoulder
the
entir
burden
of
deficit
reduct
while
ask
noth
more
from
the
wealthiest
and
the
most
power
.
we
wo
n't
grow
the
middl
class
simpli
by
shift
the
cost
of
health
care
or
colleg
onto
famili
that
are
alreadi
struggl
or
by
forc
commun
to
lay
off
more
teacher
and
more
cop
and
more
firefight
.
most
americans—democrat
,
republican
,
and
independents—understand
that
we
ca
n't
just
cut
our
way
to
prosper
.
they
know
that
broad-bas
econom
growth
requir
a
balanc
approach
to
deficit
reduct
,
with
spend
cut
and
revenu
and
with
everybodi
do
their
fair
share
.
and
that
's
the
approach
i
offer
tonight
.
on
medicar
,
i
'm
prepar
to
enact
reform
that
will
achiev
the
same
amount
of
health
care
save
by
the
begin
of
the
next
decad
as
the
reform
propos
by
the
bipartisan
simpson-bowl
commiss
.
alreadi
,
the
afford
care
act
is
help
to
slow
the
growth
of
health
care
cost
.
and
the
reform
i
'm
propos
go
even
further
.
we
'll
reduc
taxpay
subsidi
to
prescript
drug
compani
and
ask
more
from
the
wealthiest
senior
.
we
'll
bring
down
cost
by
chang
the
way
our
govern
pay
for
medicar
,
becaus
our
medic
bill
should
n't
be
base
on
the
number
of
test
order
or
day
spent
in
the
hospit
;
they
should
be
base
on
the
qualiti
of
care
that
our
senior
receiv
.
and
i
am
open
to
addit
reform
from
both
parti
,
so
long
as
they
do
n't
violat
the
guarante
of
a
secur
retir
.
our
govern
should
n't
make
promis
we
can
not
keep
,
but
we
must
keep
the
promis
we
've
alreadi
made
.
to
hit
the
rest
of
our
deficit
reduct
target
,
we
should
do
what
leader
in
both
parti
have
alreadi
suggest
and
save
hundr
of
billion
of
dollar
by
get
rid
of
tax
loophol
and
deduct
for
the
well-off
and
the
well-connect
.
after
all
,
whi
would
we
choos
to
make
deeper
cut
to
educ
and
medicar
just
to
protect
special
interest
tax
break
?
how
is
that
fair
?
whi
is
it
that
deficit
reduct
is
a
big
emerg
justifi
make
cut
in
social
secur
benefit
,
but
not
close
some
loophol
?
how
doe
that
promot
growth
?
now
is
our
best
chanc
for
bipartisan
,
comprehens
tax
reform
that
encourag
job
creation
and
help
bring
down
the
deficit
.
we
can
get
thi
done
.
the
american
peopl
deserv
a
tax
code
that
help
small
busi
spend
less
time
fill
out
complic
form
and
more
time
expand
and
hire
;
a
tax
code
that
ensur
billionair
with
high-pow
account
ca
n't
work
the
system
and
pay
a
lower
rate
than
their
hard-work
secretari
;
a
tax
code
that
lower
incent
to
move
job
oversea
and
lower
tax
rate
for
busi
and
manufactur
that
are
creat
job
right
here
in
the
unit
state
of
america
.
that
's
what
tax
reform
can
deliv
.
that
's
what
we
can
do
togeth
.
i
realiz
that
tax
reform
and
entitl
reform
will
not
be
easi
.
the
polit
will
be
hard
for
both
side
.
none
of
us
will
get
a
hundr
percent
of
what
we
want
.
but
the
altern
will
cost
us
job
,
hurt
our
economi
,
visit
hardship
on
million
of
hard-work
american
.
so
let
's
set
parti
interest
asid
and
work
to
pass
a
budget
that
replac
reckless
cut
with
smart
save
and
wise
invest
in
our
futur
.
and
let
's
do
it
without
the
brinksmanship
that
stress
consum
and
scare
off
investor
.
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
can
not
keep
conduct
it
busi
by
drift
from
one
manufactur
crisi
to
the
next
.
we
ca
n't
do
it
.
let
's
agre
right
here
,
right
now
to
keep
the
peopl
's
govern
open
and
pay
our
bill
on
time
and
alway
uphold
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
unit
state
of
america
.
the
american
peopl
have
work
too
hard
,
for
too
long
,
rebuild
from
one
crisi
to
see
their
elect
offici
caus
anoth
.
now
,
most
of
us
agre
that
a
plan
to
reduc
the
deficit
must
be
part
of
our
agenda
.
but
let
's
be
clear
:
deficit
reduct
alon
is
not
an
econom
plan
.
a
grow
economi
that
creat
good
,
middl
class
job
,
that
must
be
the
north
star
that
guid
our
effort
.
everi
day
,
we
should
ask
ourselv
three
question
as
a
nation
:
how
do
we
attract
more
job
to
our
shore
?
how
do
we
equip
our
peopl
with
the
skill
they
need
to
get
those
job
?
and
how
do
we
make
sure
that
hard
work
lead
to
a
decent
live
?
now
,
a
year
and
a
half
ago
,
i
put
forward
an
american
job
act
that
independ
economist
said
would
creat
more
than
1
million
new
job
.
and
i
thank
the
last
congress
for
pass
some
of
that
agenda
.
i
urg
thi
congress
to
pass
the
rest
.
but
tonight
i'll
lay
out
addit
propos
that
are
fulli
paid
for
and
fulli
consist
with
the
budget
framework
both
parti
agre
to
just
18
month
ago
.
let
me
repeat
:
noth
i'm
propos
tonight
should
increas
our
deficit
by
a
singl
dime
.
it
is
not
a
bigger
govern
we
need
,
but
a
smarter
govern
that
set
prioriti
and
invest
in
broad-bas
growth
.
that
's
what
we
should
be
look
for
.
our
first
prioriti
is
make
america
a
magnet
for
new
job
and
manufactur
.
after
shed
job
for
more
than
10
year
,
our
manufactur
have
ad
about
500,000
job
over
the
past
3
.
caterpillar
is
bring
job
back
from
japan
.
ford
is
bring
job
back
from
mexico
.
and
thi
year
,
appl
will
start
make
mac
in
america
again
.
there
are
thing
we
can
do
right
now
to
acceler
thi
trend
.
last
year
,
we
creat
our
first
manufactur
innov
institut
in
youngstown
,
ohio
.
a
once-shutt
warehous
is
now
a
state-of-the-art
lab
where
new
worker
are
master
the
3-d
print
that
ha
the
potenti
to
revolution
the
way
we
make
almost
everyth
.
there
's
no
reason
thi
ca
n't
happen
in
other
town
.
so
tonight
i
'm
announc
the
launch
of
three
more
of
these
manufactur
hub
,
where
busi
will
partner
with
the
depart
of
defens
and
energi
to
turn
region
left
behind
by
global
into
global
center
of
high-tech
job
.
and
i
ask
thi
congress
to
help
creat
a
network
of
15
of
these
hub
and
guarante
that
the
next
revolut
in
manufactur
is
made
right
here
in
america
.
we
can
get
that
done
.
now
,
if
we
want
to
make
the
best
product
,
we
also
have
to
invest
in
the
best
idea
.
everi
dollar
we
invest
to
map
the
human
genom
return
$
140
to
our
economy—everi
dollar
.
today
,
our
scientist
are
map
the
human
brain
to
unlock
the
answer
to
alzheim
's
.
they
're
develop
drug
to
regener
damag
organ
,
devis
new
materi
to
make
batteri
10
time
more
power
.
now
is
not
the
time
to
gut
these
job-creat
invest
in
scienc
and
innov
,
now
is
the
time
to
reach
a
level
of
research
and
develop
not
seen
sinc
the
height
of
the
space
race
.
we
need
to
make
those
invest
.
today
,
no
area
hold
more
promis
than
our
invest
in
american
energi
.
after
year
of
talk
about
it
,
we
're
final
pois
to
control
our
own
energi
futur
.
we
produc
more
oil
at
home
than
we
have
in
15
year
.
we
have
doubl
the
distanc
our
car
will
go
on
a
gallon
of
ga
and
the
amount
of
renew
energi
we
gener
from
sourc
like
wind
and
solar
,
with
ten
of
thousand
of
good
american
job
to
show
for
it
.
we
produc
more
natur
ga
than
ever
befor
,
and
nearli
everyon
's
energi
bill
is
lower
becaus
of
it
.
and
over
the
last
4
year
,
our
emiss
of
the
danger
carbon
pollut
that
threaten
our
planet
have
actual
fallen
.
but
for
the
sake
of
our
children
and
our
futur
,
we
must
do
more
to
combat
climat
chang
.
now
,
it
's
true
that
no
singl
event
make
a
trend
.
but
the
fact
is
,
the
12
hottest
year
on
record
have
all
come
in
the
last
15
.
heat
wave
,
drought
,
wildfir
,
floods—al
are
now
more
frequent
and
more
intens
.
we
can
choos
to
believ
that
superstorm
sandi
and
the
most
sever
drought
in
decad
and
the
worst
wildfir
some
state
have
ever
seen
were
all
just
a
freak
coincid
.
or
we
can
choos
to
believ
in
the
overwhelm
judgment
of
scienc
and
act
befor
it
's
too
late
.
now
,
the
good
news
is
we
can
make
meaning
progress
on
thi
issu
while
drive
strong
econom
growth
.
i
urg
thi
congress
to
get
togeth
,
pursu
a
bipartisan
,
market-bas
solut
to
climat
chang
,
like
the
one
john
mccain
and
joe
lieberman
work
on
togeth
a
few
year
ago
.
but
if
congress
wo
n't
act
soon
to
protect
futur
gener
,
i
will
.
i
will
direct
my
cabinet
to
come
up
with
execut
action
we
can
take
,
now
and
in
the
futur
,
to
reduc
pollut
,
prepar
our
commun
for
the
consequ
of
climat
chang
,
and
speed
the
transit
to
more
sustain
sourc
of
energi
.
and
4
year
ago
,
other
countri
domin
the
clean
energi
market
and
the
job
that
came
with
it
.
and
we
've
begun
to
chang
that
.
last
year
,
wind
energi
ad
nearli
half
of
all
new
power
capac
in
america
.
so
let
's
gener
even
more
.
solar
energi
get
cheaper
by
the
year
;
let
's
drive
down
cost
even
further
.
as
long
as
countri
like
china
keep
go
all
in
on
clean
energi
,
so
must
we
.
now
,
in
the
meantim
,
the
natur
ga
boom
ha
led
to
cleaner
power
and
greater
energi
independ
.
we
need
to
encourag
that
.
and
that
's
whi
my
administr
will
keep
cut
redtap
and
speed
up
new
oil
and
ga
permit
.
that
's
got
to
be
part
of
an
all-of-the-abov
plan
.
but
i
also
want
to
work
with
thi
congress
to
encourag
the
research
and
technolog
that
help
natur
ga
burn
even
cleaner
and
protect
our
air
and
our
water
.
in
fact
,
much
of
our
new-found
energi
is
drawn
from
land
and
water
that
we
,
the
public
,
own
togeth
.
so
tonight
i
propos
we
use
some
of
our
oil
and
ga
revenu
to
fund
an
energi
secur
trust
that
will
drive
new
research
and
technolog
to
shift
our
car
and
truck
off
oil
for
good
.
if
a
nonpartisan
coalit
of
ceo
and
retir
gener
and
admir
can
get
behind
thi
idea
,
then
so
can
we
.
let
's
take
their
advic
and
free
our
famili
and
busi
from
the
pain
spike
in
ga
price
we
've
put
up
with
for
far
too
long
.
i
'm
also
issu
a
new
goal
for
america
:
let
's
cut
in
half
the
energi
wast
by
our
home
and
busi
over
the
next
20
year
.
we
'll
work
with
the
state
to
do
it
.
those
state
with
the
best
idea
to
creat
job
and
lower
energi
bill
by
construct
more
effici
build
will
receiv
feder
support
to
help
make
that
happen
.
america
's
energi
sector
is
just
one
part
of
an
age
infrastructur
badli
in
need
of
repair
.
ask
ani
ceo
where
they
'd
rather
locat
and
hire
,
a
countri
with
deterior
road
and
bridg
or
one
with
high-spe
rail
and
internet
,
high-tech
school
,
self-heal
power
grid
.
the
ceo
of
siemen
america—a
compani
that
brought
hundr
of
new
job
to
north
carolina—said
that
if
we
upgrad
our
infrastructur
,
they
'll
bring
even
more
job
.
and
that
's
the
attitud
of
a
lot
of
compani
all
around
the
world
.
and
i
know
you
want
these
job-creat
project
in
your
district
.
i
've
seen
all
those
ribbon-cut
.
[

so
tonight
i
propos
a
fix-it-first
program
to
put
peopl
to
work
as
soon
as
possibl
on
our
most
urgent
repair
,
like
the
nearli
70,000
structur
defici
bridg
across
the
countri
.
and
to
make
sure
taxpay
do
n't
shoulder
the
whole
burden
,
i
'm
also
propos
a
partnership
to
rebuild
america
that
attract
privat
capit
to
upgrad
what
our
busi
need
most
:
modern
port
to
move
our
good
,
modern
pipelin
to
withstand
a
storm
,
modern
school
worthi
of
our
children
.
let
's
prove
there
's
no
better
place
to
do
busi
than
here
in
the
unit
state
of
america
,
and
let
's
start
right
away
.
we
can
get
thi
done
.
and
part
of
our
rebuild
effort
must
also
involv
our
hous
sector
.
the
good
news
is
,
our
hous
market
is
final
heal
from
the
collaps
of
2007
.
home

home

up
nearli
50
percent
,
and
construct
is
expand

but
even
with
mortgag

near
a
50-year
low
,
too
mani
famili
with
solid

who
want
to
buy

too
mani

and
want

be
told
no
.
that
's
hold
our
entir
economi
back
.
we
need
to
fix
it
.
right
now
there
's
a
bill
in
thi
congress
that
would
give
everi
respons
homeown
in
america
the
chanc
to
save
$
3,000
a
year
by
refinanc
at
today
's
rate
.
democrat
and
republican
have
support
it
befor
,
so
what
are
we
wait
for
?
take
a
vote
and
send
me
that
bill
.
whi
are—whi
would
we
be

whi
would
that
be

right
now
overlap
regul
keep
respons
young
famili
from

.
what
's
hold
us
back
?
let
's
streamlin
the
process
and
help
our
economi
grow
.
these
initi
in
manufactur
,
energi
,
infrastructur
,
hous
,
all
these
thing
will
help
entrepreneur
and
small-busi
owner
expand
and
creat
new
job
.
but
none
of
it
will
matter
unless
we
also
equip
our
citizen
with
the
skill
and
train
to
fill
those
job
.
and
that
ha
to
start
at
the
earliest
possibl
age
.
studi
after
studi
show
that
the
sooner
a
child
begin
learn
,
the
better
he
or
she
doe
down
the
road
.
but
today
,
fewer
than
3
in
10
4-year-old
are
enrol
in
a
high-qual
preschool
program
.
most
middl
class
parent
ca
n't
afford
a
few
hundr
buck
a
week
for
a
privat
preschool
.
and
for
poor
kid
who
need
help
the
most
,
thi
lack
of
access
to
preschool
educ
can
shadow
them
for
the
rest
of
their
live
.
so
tonight
i
propos
work
with
state
to
make
high-qual
preschool
avail
to
everi
singl
child
in
america
.
that
's
someth
we
should
be
abl
to
do
.
everi
dollar
we
invest
in
high-qual
earli
childhood
educ
can
save
more
than
7
dollar
later
on
:
by
boost
graduat
rate
,
reduc
teen
pregnanc
,
even
reduc
violent
crime
.
in
state
that
make
it
a
prioriti
to
educ
our
youngest
children
,
like
georgia
or
oklahoma
,
studi
show
student
grow
up
more
like
to
read
and
do
math
at
grade
level
,
graduat
high
school
,
hold
a
job
,
form
more
stabl
famili
of
their
own
.
we
know
thi
work
.
so
let
's
do
what
work
and
make
sure
none
of
our
children
start
the
race
of
life
alreadi
behind
.
let
's
give
our
kid
that
chanc
.
let
's
also
make
sure
that
a
high
school
diploma
put
our
kid
on
a
path
to
a
good
job
.
right
now
countri
like
germani
focu
on
graduat
their
high
school
student
with
the
equival
of
a
technic
degre
from
one
of
our
commun
colleg
.
so
those
german
kid
,
they
're
readi
for
a
job
when
they
graduat
high
school
.
they
've
been
train
for
the
job
that
are
there
.
now
at
school
like
p-tech
in
brooklyn
,
a
collabor
between
new
york
public
school
and
citi
univers
of
new
york
and
ibm
,
student
will
graduat
with
a
high
school
diploma
and
an
associ
's
degre
in
comput
or
engin
.
we
need
to
give
everi
american
student
opportun
like
thi
.
and
4
year
ago
,
we
start
race
to
the
top
,
a
competit
that
convinc
almost
everi
state
to
develop
smarter
curricula
and
higher
standard
,
all
for
about
1
percent
of
what
we
spend
on
educ
each
year
.
tonight
i
'm
announc
a
new
challeng
to
redesign
america
's
high
school
so
they
better
equip
graduat
for
the
demand
of
a
high-tech
economi
.
and
we
'll
reward
school
that
develop
new
partnership
with
colleg
and
employ
and
creat
class
that
focu
on
scienc
,
technolog
,
engin
,
and
math
:
the
skill
today
's
employ
are
look
for
to
fill
the
job
that
are
there
right
now
and
will
be
there
in
the
futur
.
now
,
even
with
better
high
school
,
most
young
peopl
will
need
some
higher
educ
.
it
's
a
simpl
fact
:
the
more
educ
you
've
got
,
the
more
like
you
are
to
have
a
good
job
and
work
your
way
into
the
middl
class
.
but
today
,
skyrocket
cost
price
too
mani
young
peopl
out
of
a
higher
educ
or
saddl
them
with
unsustain
debt
.
through
tax
credit
,
grant
,
and
better
loan
,
we
've
made
colleg
more
afford
for
million
of
student
and
famili
over
the
last
few
year
.
but
taxpay
ca
n't
keep
on
subsid
higher
and
higher
and
higher
cost
for
higher
educ
.
colleg
must
do
their
part
to
keep
cost
down
,
and
it
's
our
job
to
make
sure
that
they
do
.
so
tonight
i
ask
congress
to
chang
the
higher
educ
act
so
that
afford
and
valu
are
includ
in
determin
which
colleg
receiv
certain
type
of
feder
aid
.
and
tomorrow
my
administr
will
releas
a
new
colleg
scorecard
that
parent
and
student
can
use
to
compar
school
base
on
a
simpl
criterion
:
where
you
can
get
the
most
bang
for
your
educ
buck
.
now
,
to
grow
our
middl
class
,
our
citizen
have
to
have
access
to
the
educ
and
train
that
today
's
job
requir
.
but
we
also
have
to
make
sure
that
america
remain
a
place
where
everyon
who
's
will
to
work—everybodi
who
's
will
to
work
hard—ha
the
chanc
to
get
ahead
.
our
economi
is
stronger
when
we
har
the
talent
and
ingenu
of
strive
,
hope
immigr
.
and
right
now
leader
from
the
busi
,
labor
,
law
enforc
,
faith
commun
,
they
all
agre
that
the
time
ha
come
to
pass
comprehens

now
is
the

[

now
is
the
time
to
get
it
done
.
real
reform
mean
stronger
border
secur
,
and
we
can
build
on
the
progress
my
administr
ha
alreadi
made
:
put
more
boot
on
the
southern
border
than
at
ani
time
in
our
histori
and
reduc
illeg
cross
to
their
lowest
level
in
40
year
.
real
reform
mean
establish
a
respons
pathway
to
earn
citizenship
,
a
path
that
includ
pass
a
background
check
,
pay
tax
and
a
meaning
penalti
,
learn
english
,
and
go
to
the
back
of
the
line
behind
the
folk
tri
to
come
here
legal
.
and
real
reform
mean
fix
the
legal
immigr
system
to
cut
wait
period
and
attract
the
highli
skill
entrepreneur
and
engin
that
will
help
creat
job
and
grow
our
economi
.
in
other
word
,
we
know
what
need
to
be
done
.
and
as
we
speak
,
bipartisan
group
in
both
chamber
are
work
dilig
to
draft
a
bill
,
and
i
applaud
their
effort
.
so
let'
get
thi
done
.
send
me
a
comprehens
immigr
reform
bill
in
the
next
few
month
,
and
i
will
sign
it
right
away
.
and
america
will
be
better
for
it
.
let
's
get
it
done
.
[
applaus
]
let
's
get
it
done
.
but
we
ca
n't
stop
there
.
we
know
our
economi
is
stronger
when
our
wive
,
our
mother
,
our
daughter
can
live
their
live
free
from
discrimin
in
the
workplac
and
free
from
the
fear
of
domest
violenc
.
today
the
senat
pass
the
``
violenc
against
women'
act
''
that
joe
biden
origin
wrote
almost
20
year
ago
.
and
i
now
urg
the
hous
to
do
the
same
.
good
job
,
joe
.
and
i
ask
thi
congress
to
declar
that
women
should
earn
a
live
equal
to
their
effort
,
and
final
pass
the
``
paycheck
fair
act
''
thi
year
.
we
know
our
economi
is
stronger
when
we
reward
an
honest
day
's
work
with
honest
wage
.
but
today
,
a
full-tim
worker
make
the
minimum
wage
earn
$
14,500
a
year
.
even
with
the
tax
relief
we
put
in
place
,
a
famili
with
two
kid
that
earn
the
minimum
wage
still
live
below
the
poverti
line
.
that
's
wrong
.
that
's
whi
,
sinc
the
last
time
thi
congress
rais
the
minimum
wage
,
19
state
have
chosen
to
bump
their
even
higher
.
tonight
let
's
declar
that
in
the
wealthiest
nation
on
earth
,
no
one
who
work
full-tim
should
have
to
live
in
poverti
and
rais
the
feder
minimum
wage
to
$
9
an
hour
.
we
should
be
abl
to
get
that
done
.
thi
singl
step
would
rais
the
incom
of
million
of
work
famili
.
it
could
mean
the
differ
between
groceri
or
the
food
bank
,
rent
or
evict
,
scrape
by
or
final
get
ahead
.
for
busi
across
the
countri
,
it
would
mean
custom
with
more
money
in
their
pocket
.
and
a
whole
lot
of
folk
out
there
would
probabl
need
less
help
from
govern
.
in
fact
,
work
folk
should
n't
have
to
wait
year
after
year
for
the
minimum
wage
to
go
up
while
ceo
pay
ha
never
been
higher
.
so
here
's
an
idea
that
governor
romney
and
i
actual
agre
on
last
year
:
let
's
tie
the
minimum
wage
to
the
cost
of
live
so
that
it
final
becom
a
wage
you
can
live
on
.
tonight
let
's
also
recogn
that
there
are
commun
in
thi
countri
where
no
matter
how
hard
you
work
,
it
is
virtual
imposs
to
get
ahead
:
factori
town
decim
from
year
of
plant
pack
up
;
inescap
pocket
of
poverti
,
urban
and
rural
,
where
young
adult
are
still
fight
for
their
first
job
.
america
is
not
a
place
where
the
chanc
of
birth
or
circumst
should
decid
our
destini
.
and
that
's
whi
we
need
to
build
new
ladder
of
opportun
into
the
middl
class
for
all
who
are
will
to
climb
them
.
let
's
offer
incent
to
compani
that
hire
american
who
've
got
what
it
take
to
fill
that
job
open
,
but
have
been
out
of
work
so
long
that
no
one
will
give
them
a
chanc
anymor
.
let
's
put
peopl
back
to
work
rebuild
vacant
home
in
rundown
neighborhood
.
and
thi
year
,
my
administr
will
begin
to
partner
with
20
of
the
hardest
hit
town
in
america
to
get
these
commun
back
on
their
feet
.
now
,
we
'll
work
with
local
leader
to
target
resourc
at
public
safeti
and
educ
and
hous
.
we
'll
give
new
tax
credit
to
busi
that
hire
and
invest
.
and
we
'll
work
to
strengthen
famili
by
remov
the
financi
deterr
to
marriag
for
low-incom
coupl
and
do
more
to
encourag
fatherhood
,
becaus
what
make
you
a
man
is
n't
the
abil
to
conceiv
a
child
,
it
's
have
the
courag
to
rais

.
and
we
want
to
encourag
that
.
we
want
to
help
that
.
stronger
famili
.
stronger
commun
.
a
stronger
america
.
it
is
thi
kind
of
prosperity—broad
,
share
,
built
on
a
thrive
middl
class—that
ha
alway
been
the
sourc
of
our
progress
at
home
.
it
's
also
the
foundat
of
our
power
and
influenc
throughout
the
world
.
tonight
we
stand
unit
in
salut
the
troop
and
civilian
who
sacrific
everi
day
to
protect
us
.
becaus
of
them
,
we
can
say
with
confid
that
america
will
complet
it
mission
in
afghanistan
and
achiev
our
object
of
defeat
the
core
of
al

.
alreadi
,
we
have
brought
home
33,000
of
our

thi
spring
,
our

will
move
into

while
afghan

tonight
i
can
announc
that
over
the
next

anoth
34,000

thi

and
by

our

beyond

,
america
's
commit

allow
us
to
pursu
the
remnant
of

and
their

today
,
the
organ
that
attack
us
on
9/11
is
a
shadow
of
it
former
self
.
it'
true
,
differ
al
qaida
affili
and
extremist
group
have
emerg
,
from
the
arabian
peninsula
to
africa
.
the
threat
these
group
pose
is
evolv
.
but
to
meet
thi
threat
,
we
do
n't
need
to
send
ten
of
thousand
of
our
son
and
daughter
abroad
or
occupi
other
nation
.
instead
,
we
'll
need
to
help
countri
like
yemen
and
libya
and
somalia
provid
for
their
own
secur
and
help
alli
who
take
the
fight
to
terrorist
,
as
we
have
in
mali
.
and
where
necessari
,
through
a
rang
of
capabl
,
we
will
continu
to
take
direct
action
against
those
terrorist
who
pose
the
gravest
threat
to
american

now
,
as
we
do
,
we
must
enlist
our
valu
in
the
fight
.
that
's
whi
my
administr
ha
work
tirelessli
to
forg
a
durabl
legal
and
polici
framework
to
guid
our
counterterror
effort
.
throughout
,
we
have
kept
congress
fulli
inform
of
our
effort
.
i
recogn
that
in
our
democraci
,
no
one
should
just
take
my
word
for
it
that
we
're
do
thing
the
right
way
.
so
,
in
the
month
ahead
,
i
will
continu
to
engag
congress
to

that
our
target
,
detent

and
prosecut

but
that
our

are
even
more

the
american
peopl
and
to
the
world
.
of
cours
,
our
challeng
do
n't
end
with
al
qaida
.
america
will
continu
to
lead
the
effort
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
world
's
most
danger
weapon
.
the
regim
in
north
korea
must
know
they
will
onli
achiev
secur
and
prosper
by
meet
their
intern
oblig
.
provoc
of
the
sort
we
saw
last
night
will
onli
further
isol
them
,
as
we
stand
by
our
alli
,
strengthen
our
own
missil
defens
,
and
lead
the
world
in
take
firm
action
in
respons
to
these
threat
.
likewis
,
the
leader
of
iran
must
recogn
that
now
is
the
time
for
a
diplomat
solut
,
becaus
a
coalit
stand
unit
in
demand
that
they
meet
their
oblig
,
and
we
will
do
what
is
necessari
to
prevent
them
from
get
a
nuclear
weapon
.
at
the
same
time
,
we
'll
engag
russia
to
seek
further
reduct
in
our
nuclear
arsen
and
continu
lead
the
global
effort
to
secur
nuclear
materi
that
could
fall
into
the
wrong
hand
,
becaus
our
abil
to
influenc
other
depend
on
our
willing
to
lead
and
meet

america
must
also
face
the
rapidli

now

are
also

the
abil

we

and
wonder
whi
we
did
noth
in
the
face
of
real
threat
to
our

by
increas
inform
share
and
develop
standard
to
protect
our
nation
secur
,
our

,
and
our

but
now
congress
must
act
as
well
,
by
pass
legisl
to
give
our
govern
a
greater
capac
to
secur
our
network
and
deter
attack

thi
is
someth
we
should
be
abl
to
get
done
on
a
bipartisan
basi
.
now
,
even
as
we
protect
our

,
we
should
rememb
that

all

not

becaus
it

wave

includ
a
man
who
said
:
``

''
in

and
we

but
we
can
and
will
insist
on
respect

we
