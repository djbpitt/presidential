been

the

who

the
ruin
of

for
the

which

have
receiv

if
it

as
the

seem
to
assum
,
that
foreign

in
thi
case
,
discard
all

actuat
by
no
higher
principl
than
thi

i
am
quit
sure
a

could

made

that
they
can
reach

more
readili

it

the

the

with

i
ventur
to

it
will
appear
that
we
have
practic

with

i

while
under
thi
gener
recommend
provis
for

our
seacoast
line
readili
occur
to
the
mind
,
i
also
in
the
same
connect
ask
the
attent
of
congress
to
our
great
lake
and
river
.
it
is
believ
that
some
fortif

depot
of
arm

munit
,
with
harbor
and
navig
improv
,
all
at
well-select
point
upon

,
would
be
of
great
import
to

i
ask
attent
to
the
view
of
the
secretari
of
war
,
express
in
hi
report
,
upon
the
same
gener
subject
.
i
deem
it
of
import
that
the
loyal
region
of
east
tennesse
and
western
north
carolina
should
be
connect
with
kentucki
and
other

part
of

union
by

.
i
therefor
recommend
,
as
a
militari
measur
,
that
congress
provid
for
the
construct
of
such
road
as
speedili
as
possibl
.
kentucki
no
doubt
will
cooper
,
and
through
her
legislatur
make
the
most
judici
select
of
a
line
.
the
northern
terminu
must
connect
with
some
exist
railroad
,
and
whether
the
rout
shall
be
from
lexington
or
nicholasvil
to
the
cumberland
gap
,
or
from
lebanon
to
the
tennesse
line
,
in
the
direct
of
knoxvil
,
or
on
some
still
differ
line
,
can
easili
be
determin
.
kentucki
and
the
gener
govern
cooper
,
the
work
can
be
complet
in
a
veri
short
time
,
and
when
done
it
will
be
not
onli
of
vast
present
use
,
but
also
a
valuabl
perman
improv
,
worth
it
cost
in
all
the
futur
.
some
treati
,
design
chiefli
for

of

and
have
no
grave
polit
import
,
have
been
negoti

and
will
be
submit
to
the
senat
for
their
consider
.
although
we
have
fail
to
induc
some
of
the
commerci
power
to
adopt
a
desir
melior
of
the
rigor
of
maritim

,
we
have
remov
all

i
repeat
the
recommend
of
my

in

annual
messag
to

in
decemb
last
in
regard
to
the
disposit
of
the
surplu
which
will
probabl
remain
after
satisfi
the
claim
of
american

,
pursuant
to
the
award
of

under

if

would

i
respect
recommend
to
the
consider
of
congress
the
present
condit
of
the
statut
law
,
with
the
hope
that
congress
will
be
abl
to
find
an
easi
remedi
for
mani
of
the
inconveni
and
evil
which
constantli
embarrass
those
engag
in
the
practic
administr
of
them
.
sinc
the
organ
of
the
govern
congress
ha
enact
some
5,000
act
and
joint
resolut
,
which
fill
more
than
6,000
close
print
page
and
are
scatter
through
mani
volum
.
mani
of
these
act
have
been
drawn
in
hast
and
without
suffici
caution
,
so
that
their
provis
are
often
obscur
in
themselv
or
in
conflict
with
each
other
,
or
at
least
so
doubt
as
to
render
it
veri
difficult
for
even
the
best-inform
person
to
ascertain
precis
what
the
statut
law
realli
is
.
it
seem
to
me
veri
import
that
the
statut
law
should
be
made
as
plain
and
intellig
as
possibl
,
and
be
reduc
to
as
small
a
compass
as
may
consist
with
the
full
and
precis
of
the
will
of
the
legislatur
and
the
perspicu
of
it
languag
.
thi
well
done
would
,
i
think
,
greatli
facilit
the
labor
of
those
whose
duti
it
is
to
assist
in
the
administr
of
the
law
,
and
would
be
a
last
benefit
to
the
peopl
,
by
place
befor
them
in
a
more
access
and
intellig
form
the
law
which
so
deepli
concern
their
interest
and
their
duti
.
i
am
inform
by
some
whose
opinion
i
respect
that
all
the
act
of
congress
now
in
forc
and
of
a
perman
and
gener
natur
might
be
revis
and
rewritten
so
as
to
be
embrac
in
one
volum
(
or
at
most
two
volum
)
of
ordinari
and
conveni
size
;
and
i
respect
recommend
to
congress
to
consid
of
the
subject
,
and
if
my
suggest
be
approv
to
devis
such
plan
as
to
their
wisdom
shall
seem
most
proper
for
the
attain
of
the
end
propos
.
one
of
the
unavoid
consequ
of
the
present
insurrect
is
the
entir
suppress
in
mani
place
of
all
the
ordinari
mean
of
administ
civil
justic
by
the
offic
and
in
the
form
of
exist
law
.
thi
is
the
case
,
in
whole
or
in
part
,
in
all
the
insurg
state
;
and
as
our
armi
advanc
upon
and
take
possess
of
part
of
those
state
the
practic
evil
becom
more
appar
.
there
are
no
court
nor
offic
to
whom
the
citizen
of
other
state
may
appli
for
the
enforc
of
their
law
claim
against
citizen
of
the
insurg
state
,
and
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
debt
constitut
such
claim
.
some
have
estim
it
as
high
as
$
200,000,000
,
due
in
larg
part
from
insurg
in
open
rebellion
to
loyal
citizen
who
are
even
now
make
great
sacrific
in
the
discharg
of
their
patriot
duti
to
support
the
govern
.
under
these
circumst
i
have
been
urgent
solicit
to
establish
by
militari
power
court
to
administ
summari
justic
in
such
case
i
have
thu
far
declin
to
do
it
,
not
becaus
i
had
ani
doubt
that
the
end
propos
--
the
collect
of
the
debt
--
wa
just
and
right
in
itself
,
but
becaus
i
have
been
unwil
to
go
beyond
the
pressur
of
necess
in
the
unusu
exercis
of
power
.
but
the
power
of
congress
,
i
suppos
,
are
equal
to
the
anomal
occas
,
and
therefor
i
refer
the
whole
matter
to
congress
,
with
the
hope
that
a
plan
may
be
devis
for
the
administr
of
justic
in
all
such
part
of
the
insurg
state
and
territori
as
may
be
under
the
control
of
thi
govern
,
whether
by
a
voluntari
return
to
allegi
and
order
or
by
the
power
of
our
arm
;
thi
,
howev
,
not
to
be
a
perman
institut
,
but
a
temporari
substitut
,
and
to
ceas
as
soon
as
the
ordinay
court
can
be
reestablish
in
peac
.
it
is
import
that
some
more
conveni
mean
should
be
provid
,
if
possibl
,
for
the
adjust
of
claim
against
the
govern
,
especi
in
view
of
their
increas
number
by
reason
of
the
war
.
it
is
as
much
the
duti
of
govern
to
render
prompt
justic
against
itself
in
favor
of
citizen
as
it
is
to
administ
the
same
between
privat
individu
.
the
investig
and
adjud
of
claim
in
their
natur
belong
to
the
judici
depart
.
besid
,
it
is
appar
that
the
attent
of
congress
will
be
more
than
usual
engag
for
some

to
come

the

i

the

it

the
say

that

found
in
the
most
grave
and
matur
consid
public

,
as
well
as
in

in

we

of

of

and
the
denial
to

of

to

a

voic
against
thi
approach
of

it
is
not
need
nor
fit
here
that
a
gener
argument
should
be
made
in
favor
of
popular
institut
,
but
there
is
one
point
,
with
it
connect
,
not
so
hackney
as
most
other
,
to
which
i
ask
a
brief
attent
.
it
is
the
effort
to
place
capit
on
an
equal
foot
with
,
if
not
abov
,
labor
in
the
structur
of

.
it
is
assum
that
labor
is
avail
onli
in
connect
with
capit
;
that
nobodi
labor
unless
somebodi
els
,
own
capit
,
somehow
by
the
use
of
it
induc
him
to
labor
.
thi
assum
,
it
is
next
consid
whether
it
is
best
that
capit
shall
hire
labor
,
and
thu
induc
them
to
work
by
their
own
consent
,
or
buy
them
and
drive
them
to
it
without
their
consent
.
have
proceed
so
far
,
it
is
natur
conclud
that
all
labor
are
either
hire
labor
or
what
we
call
slave
.
and
further
,
it
is
assum
that
whoever
is
onc
a
hire
labor
is
fix
in
that
condit
for
life
.
now
there
is
no
such
relat
between
capit
and
labor
as
assum
,
nor
is
there
ani
such
thing
as
a
free
man
be
fix
for
life
in
the
condit
of
a
hire
labor
.
both
these
assumpt
are
fals
,
and
all
infer
from
them
are
groundless
.
labor
is
prior
to
and
independ
of
capit
.
capit
is
onli
the
fruit
of
labor
,
and
could
never
have
exist
if
labor
had
not
first
exist
.
labor
is
the
superior
of
capit
,
and
deserv
much
the
higher
consider
.
capit
ha
it
right
,
which
are
as
worthi
of
protect
as
ani
other
right
.
nor
is
it
deni
that
there
is
,
and
probabl
alway
will
be
,
a
relat
between
labor
and
capit
produc
mutual
benefit
.
the
error
is
in
assum
that
the
whole
labor
of
commun
exist
within
that
relat
.
a
few
men
own
capit
,
and
that
few
avoid
labor
themselv
,
and
with
their
capit
hire
or
buy
anoth
few
to
labor
for
them
.
a
larg
major
belong
to
neither
class
--
neither
work
for
other
nor
have
other
work
for
them
.
in
most
of
the
southern
state
a
major
of
the
whole
peopl
of
all
color
are
neither
slave
nor
master
,
while
in
the
northern
a
larg
major
are
neither
hirer
nor
hire
.
men
,
with
their
famili
--
wive
,
son
,
and
daughter
--
work
for
themselv
on
their
farm
,
in
their
hous
,
and
in
their
shop
,
take
the
whole
product
to
themselv
,
and
ask
no
favor
of
capit
on
the
one
hand
nor
of
hire
labor
or
slave
on
the
other
.
it
is
not
forgotten
that
a
consider
number
of
person
mingl
their
own
labor
with
capit
;
that
is
,
they
labor
with
their
own
hand
and
also
buy
or
hire
other
to
labor
for
them
;
but
thi
is
onli
a
mix
and
not
a
distinct
class
.
no
principl
state
is
disturb
by
the
exist
of
thi
mix
class
.
again
,
as
ha
alreadi
been
said
,
there
is
not
of
necess
ani
such
thing
as
the
free
hire
labor
be
fix
to
that
condit
for

.
