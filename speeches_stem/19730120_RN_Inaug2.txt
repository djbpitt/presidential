mr.
vice
presid
,
mr.
speaker
,
mr.
chief
justic
,
senat
cook
,
mrs.
eisenhow
,
and
my
fellow
citizen
of
thi
great
and
good
countri
we
share
togeth
:
when
we
met
here
four
year
ago
,
america
wa
bleak
in
spirit
,
depress
by
the
prospect
of
seemingli
endless
war
abroad
and
of
destruct
conflict
at
home
.
as
we
meet
here
today
,
we
stand
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
era
of
peac
in
the
world
.
the
central
question
befor
us
is
:
how
shall
we
use
that
peac
?
let
us
resolv
that
thi
era
we
are
about
to
enter
will
not
be
what
other
postwar
period
have
so
often
been
:
a
time
of
retreat
and
isol
that
lead
to
stagnat
at
home
and
invit
new
danger
abroad
.
let
us
resolv
that
thi
will
be
what
it
can
becom
:
a
time
of
great
respons
greatli
born
,
in
which
we
renew
the
spirit
and
the
promis
of
america
as
we
enter
our
third
centuri
as
a
nation
.
thi
past
year
saw
far-reach
result
from
our
new
polici
for
peac
.
by
continu
to
revit
our
tradit
friendship
,
and
by
our
mission
to
peke
and
to
moscow
,
we
were
abl
to
establish
the
base
for
a
new
and
more
durabl
pattern
of
relationship
among
the
nation
of
the
world
.
becaus
of
america
's
bold
initi
,
1972
will
be
long
rememb
as
the
year
of
the
greatest
progress
sinc
the
end
of
world
war
ii
toward
a
last
peac
in
the
world
.
the
peac
we
seek
in
the
world
is
not
the
flimsi
peac
which
is
mere
an
interlud
between
war
,
but
a
peac
which
can
endur
for
gener
to
come
.
it
is
import
that
we
understand
both
the
necess
and
the
limit
of
america'
role
in
maintain
that
peac
.
unless
we
in
america
work
to
preserv
the
peac
,
there
will
be
no
peac
.
unless
we
in
america
work
to
preserv
freedom
,
there
will
be
no
freedom
.
but
let
us
clearli
understand
the
new
natur
of
america
's
role
,
as
a
result
of
the
new
polici
we
have
adopt
over
these
past
four
year
.
we
shall
respect
our
treati
commit
.
we
shall
support
vigor
the
principl
that
no
countri
ha
the
right
to
impos
it
will
or
rule
on
anoth
by
forc
.
we
shall
continu
,
in
thi
era
of
negoti
,
to
work
for
the
limit
of
nuclear
arm
,
and
to
reduc
the
danger
of
confront
between
the
great
power
.
we
shall
do
our
share
in
defend
peac
and
freedom
in
the
world
.
but
we
shall
expect
other
to
do
their
share
.
the
time
ha
pass
when
america
will
make
everi
other
nation
's
conflict
our
own
,
or
make
everi
other
nation
's
futur
our
respons
,
or
presum
to
tell
the
peopl
of
other
nation
how
to
manag
their
own
affair
.
just
as
we
respect
the
right
of
each
nation
to
determin
it
own
futur
,
we
also
recogn
the
respons
of
each
nation
to
secur
it
own
futur
.
just
as
america
's
role
is
indispens
in
preserv
the
world
's
peac
,
so
is
each
nation
's
role
indispens
in
preserv
it
own
peac
.
togeth
with
the
rest
of
the
world
,
let
us
resolv
to
move
forward
from
the
begin
we
have
made
.
let
us
continu
to
bring
down
the
wall
of
hostil
which
have
divid
the
world
for
too
long
,
and
to
build
in
their
place
bridg
of
understand
--
so
that
despit
profound
differ
between
system
of
govern
,
the
peopl
of
the
world
can
be
friend
.
let
us
build
a
structur
of
peac
in
the
world
in
which
the
weak
are
as
safe
as
the
strong
--
in
which
each
respect
the
right
of
the
other
to
live
by
a
differ
system
--
in
which
those
who
would
influenc
other
will
do
so
by
the
strength
of
their
idea
,
and
not
by
the
forc
of
their
arm
.
let
us
accept
that
high
respons
not
as
a
burden
,
but
gladli
--
gladli
becaus
the
chanc
to
build
such
a
peac
is
the
noblest
endeavor
in
which
a
nation
can
engag
;
gladli
,
also
,
becaus
onli
if
we
act
greatli
in
meet
our
respons
abroad
will
we
remain
a
great
nation
,
and
onli
if
we
remain
a
great
nation
will
we
act
greatli
in
meet
our
challeng
at
home
.
we
have
the
chanc
today
to
do
more
than
ever
befor
in
our
histori
to
make
life
better
in
america
--
to
ensur
better
educ
,
better
health
,
better
hous
,
better
transport
,
a
cleaner
environ
--
to
restor
respect
for
law
,
to
make
our
commun
more
livabl
--
and
to
insur
the
god-given
right
of
everi
american
to
full
and
equal
opportun
.
becaus
the
rang
of
our
need
is
so
great
--
becaus
the
reach
of
our
opportun
is
so
great
--
let
us
be
bold
in
our
determin
to
meet
those
need
in
new
way
.
just
as
build
a
structur
of
peac
abroad
ha
requir
turn
away
from
old
polici
that
fail
,
so
build
a
new
era
of
progress
at
home
requir
turn
away
from
old
polici
that
have
fail
.
abroad
,
the
shift
from
old
polici
to
new
ha
not
been
a
retreat
from
our
respons
,
but
a
better
way
to
peac
.
and
at
home
,
the
shift
from
old
polici
to
new
will
not
be
a
retreat
from
our
respons
,
but
a
better
way
to
progress
.
abroad
and
at
home
,
the
key
to
those
new
respons
lie
in
the
place
and
the
divis
of
respons
.
we
have
live
too
long
with
the
consequ
of
attempt
to
gather
all
power
and
respons
in
washington
.
abroad
and
at
home
,
the
time
ha
come
to
turn
away
from
the
condescend
polici
of
patern
--
of
``
washington
know
best
.
''
a
person
can
be
expect
to
act
respons
onli
if
he
ha
respons
.
thi
is
human
natur
.
so
let
us
encourag
individu
at
home
and
nation
abroad
to
do
more
for
themselv
,
to
decid
more
for
themselv
.
let
us
locat
respons
in
more
place
.
let
us
measur
what
we
will
do
for
other
by
what
they
will
do
for
themselv
.
that
is
whi
today
i
offer
no
promis
of
a
pure
government
solut
for
everi
problem
.
we
have
live
too
long
with
that
fals
promis
.
in
trust
too
much
in
govern
,
we
have
ask
of
it
more
than
it
can
deliv
.
thi
lead
onli
to
inflat
expect
,
to
reduc
individu
effort
,
and
to
a
disappoint
and
frustrat
that
erod
confid
both
in
what
govern
can
do
and
in
hat
peopl
can
do
.
govern
must
learn
to
take
less
from
peopl
so
that
peopl
an
do
more
for
themselv
.
let
us
rememb
that
america
wa
built
not
by
govern
,
but
by
peopl
--
not
by
welfar
,
but
by
work
--
not
by
shirk
respons
,
but
by
seek
respons
.
in
our
own
live
,
let
each
of
us
ask
--
not
just
what
will
govern
do
for
me
,
but
what
can
i
do
for
myself
?
in
the
challeng
we
face
togeth
,
let
each
of
us
ask
--
not
just
how
can
govern
help
,
but
how
can
i
help
?
your
nation
govern
ha
a
great
and
vital
role
to
play
.
and
i
pledg
to
you
that
where
thi
govern
should
act
,
we
will
act
boldli
and
we
will
lead
boldli
.
but
just
as
import
is
the
role
that
each
and
everi
one
of
us
must
play
,
as
an
individu
and
as
a
member
of
hi
own
commun
.
from
thi
day
forward
,
let
each
of
us
make
a
solemn
commit
in
hi
own
heart
:
to
bear
hi
respons
,
to
do
hi
part
,
to
live
hi
ideal
--
so
that
togeth
,
we
can
see
the
dawn
of
a
new
age
of
progress
for
america
,
and
togeth
,
as
we
celebr
our
200th
anniversari
as
a
nation
,
we
can
do
so
proud
in
the
fulfil
of
our
promis
to
ourselv
and
to
the
world
.
as
america
's
longest
and
most
difficult
war
come
to
an
end
,
let
us
again
learn
to
debat
our
differ
with
civil
and
decenc
.
and
let
each
of
us
reach
out
for
that
one
preciou
qualiti
govern
can
not
provid
--
a
new
level
of
respect
for
the
right
and
feel
of
one
anoth
,
a
new
level
of
respect
for
the
individu
human
digniti
which
is
the
cherish
birthright
of
everi
american
.
abov
all
els
,
the
time
ha
come
for
us
to
renew
our
faith
in
ourselv
and
in
america
.
in
recent
year
,
that
faith
ha
been
challeng
.
our
children
have
been
taught
to
be
asham
of
their
countri
,
asham
of
their
parent
,
asham
of
america
's
record
at
home
and
of
it
role
in
the
world
.
at
everi
turn
,
we
have
been
beset
by
those
who
find
everyth
wrong
with
america
and
littl
that
is
right
.
but
i
am
confid
that
thi
will
not
be
the
judgment
of
histori
on
these
remark
time
in
which
we
are
privileg
to
live
.
america
's
record
in
thi
centuri
ha
been
unparallel
in
the
world
's
histori
for
it
respons
,
for
it
generos
,
for
it
creativ
and
for
it
progress
.
let
us
be
proud
that
our
system
ha
produc
and
provid
more
freedom
and
more
abund
,
more
wide
share
,
than
ani
other
system
in
the
histori
of
the
world
.
let
us
be
proud
that
in
each
of
the
four
war
in
which
we
have
been
engag
in
thi
centuri
,
includ
the
one
we
are
now
bring
to
an
end
,
we
have
fought
not
for
our
selfish
advantag
,
but
to
help
other
resist
aggress
.
let
us
be
proud
that
by
our
bold
,
new
initi
,
and
by
our
steadfast
for
peac
with
honor
,
we
have
made
a
break-through
toward
creat
in
the
world
what
the
world
ha
not
known
befor
--
a
structur
of
peac
that
can
last
,
not
mere
for
our
time
,
but
for
gener
to
come
.
we
are
embark
here
today
on
an
era
that
present
challeng
great
as
those
ani
nation
,
or
ani
gener
,
ha
ever
face
.
we
shall
answer
to
god
,
to
histori
,
and
to
our
conscienc
for
the
way
in
which
we
use
these
year
.
as
i
stand
in
thi
place
,
so
hallow
by
histori
,
i
think
of
other
who
have
stood
here
befor
me
.
i
think
of
the
dream
they
had
for
america
,
and
i
think
of
how
each
recogn
that
he
need
help
far
beyond
himself
in
order
to
make
those
dream
come
true
.
today
,
i
ask
your
prayer
that
in
the
year
ahead
i
may
have
god
's
help
in
make
decis
that
are
right
for
america
,
and
i
pray
for
your
help
so
that
togeth
we
may
be
worthi
of
our
challeng
.
let
us
pledg
togeth
to
make
these
next
four
year
the
best
four
year
in
america'
histori
,
so
that
on
it
200th
birthday
america
will
be
as
young
and
as
vital
as
when
it
began
,
and
as
bright
a
beacon
of
hope
for
all
the
world
.
let
us
go
forward
from
here
confid
in
hope
,
strong
in
our
faith
in
one
anoth
,
sustain
by
our
faith
in
god
who
creat
us
,
and
strive
alway
to
serv
hi
purpos
