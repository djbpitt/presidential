distinguish
guest
,
and
fellow

:
last
month
,
i
went
to
andrew
air
forc
base
and
welcom
home
some
of
our
last
troop
to
serv
in
iraq
.
togeth
,
we
offer
a
final
,
proud
salut
to
the
color
under
which
more
than
a
million
of
our
fellow
citizen
fought
and
sever
thousand
gave
their
live
.
we
gather
tonight
know
that
thi
gener
of
hero
ha
made
the
unit
state
safer
and
more
respect
around
the
world
.
for
the
first
time
in
9
year
,
there
are
no
american
fight
in
iraq
.
for
the
first
time
in
two
decad
,
usama
bin
laden
is
not
a
threat
to
thi
countri
.
most
of
al
qaida
's
top
lieuten
have
been
defeat
.
the
taliban
's
momentum
ha
been
broken
,
and
some
troop
in
afghanistan
have
begun
to
come
home
.
these
achiev
are
a
testament
to
the
courag
,
selfless
,
and
teamwork
of
america
's
arm
forc
.
at
a
time
when
too
mani
of
our
institut
have
let
us
down
,
they
exceed
all
expect
.
they
're
not
consum
with
person
ambit
.
they
don't
obsess
over
their
differ
.
they
focu
on
the
mission
at
hand
.
they
work
togeth
.
imagin
what
we
could
accomplish
if
we
follow
their
exampl
.
think
about
the
america
within
our
reach
:
a
countri
that
lead
the
world
in
educ
it
peopl
;
an
america
that
attract
a
new
gener
of
high-tech
manufactur
and
high-pay
job
;
a
futur
where
we
're
in
control
of
our
own
energi
and
our
secur
and
prosper
are
n't
so
tie
to
unstabl
part
of
the
world
;
an
economi
built
to
last
,
where
hard
work
pay
off
and
respons
is
reward
.
we
can
do
thi
.
i
know
we
can
,
becaus
we
've
done
it
befor
.
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
,
when
anoth
gener
of
hero
return
home
from
combat
,
they
built
the
strongest
economi
and
middl
class
the
world
ha
ever
known
.
my
grandfath
,
a
veteran
of
patton'
armi
,
got
the
chanc
to
go
to
colleg
on
the
gi
bill
.
my
grandmoth
,
who
work
on
a
bomber
assembl
line
,
wa
part
of
a
workforc
that
turn
out
the
best
product
on
earth
.
the
two
of
them
share
the
optim
of
a
nation
that
had
triumph
over
a
depress
and
fascism
.
they
understood
they
were
part
of
someth
larger
,
that
they
were
contribut
to
a
stori
of
success
that
everi
american
had
a
chanc
to
share
,
the
basic
american
promis
that
if
you
work
hard
,
you
could
do
well
enough
to
rais
a
famili
,
own
a
home
,
send
your
kid
to
colleg
,
and
put
a
littl
away
for
retir
.
the
defin
issu
of
our
time
is
how
to
keep
that
promis
aliv
.
no
challeng
is
more
urgent
.
no
debat
is
more
import
.
we
can
either
settl
for
a
countri
where
a
shrink
number
of
peopl
do
realli
well
while
a
grow
number
of
american
bare
get
by
.
or
we
can
restor
an
economi
where
everyon
get
a
fair
shot
and
everyon
doe
their
fair
share
and
everyon
play
by
the
same
set
of
rule
.
what
's
at
stake
aren't
democrat
valu
or
republican
valu
,
but
american
valu
.
and
we
have
to
reclaim
them
.
let
's
rememb
how
we
got
here
.
long
befor
the
recess
,
job
and
manufactur
began
leav
our
shore
.
technolog
made
busi
more
effici
,
but
also
made
some
job
obsolet
.
folk
at
the
top
saw
their
incom
rise
like
never
befor
,
but
most
hard-work
american
struggl
with
cost
that
were
grow
,
paycheck
that
were
n't
,
and
person
debt
that
kept
pile
up
.
in
2008
,
the
hous
of
card
collaps
.
we
learn
that
mortgag
had
been
sold
to
peopl
who
could
n't
afford
or
understand
them
.
bank
had
made
huge
bet
and
bonus
with
other
peopl
's
money
.
regul
had
look
the
other
way
or
did
n't
have
the
author
to
stop
the
bad
behavior
.
it
wa
wrong
,
it
wa
irrespons
,
and
it
plung
our
economi
into
a
crisi
that
put
million
out
of
work
,
saddl
us
with
more
debt
,
and
left
innoc
,
hard-work
american
hold
the
bag
.
in
the
6
month
befor
i
took
offic
,
we
lost
nearli
4
million
job
.
and
we
lost
anoth
4
million
befor
our
polici
were
in
full
effect
.
those
are
the
fact
.
but
so
are
these
:
in
the
last
22
month
,
busi
have
creat
more
than
3
million
job
.
last
year
,
they
creat
the
most
job
sinc
2005
.
american
manufactur
are
hire
again
,
creat
job
for
the
first
time
sinc
the
late
1990
.
togeth
,
we
've
agre
to
cut
the
deficit
by
more
than
$
2
trillion
.
and
we
've
put
in
place
new
rule
to
hold
wall
street
account
so
a
crisi
like
thi
never
happen
again
.
the
state
of
our
union
is
get
stronger
.
and
we
've
come
too
far
to
turn
back
now
.
as
long
as
i
'm
presid
,
i
will
work
with
anyon
in
thi
chamber
to
build
on
thi
momentum
.
but
i
intend
to
fight
obstruct
with
action
,
and
i
will
oppos
ani
effort
to
return
to
the
veri
same
polici
that
brought
on
thi
econom
crisi
in
the
first
place
.
no
,
we
will
not
go
back
to
an
economi
weaken
by
outsourc
,
bad
debt
,
and
phoni
financi
profit
.
tonight
i
want
to
speak
about
how
we
move
forward
and
lay
out
a
blueprint
for
an
economi
that
's
built
to
last
,
an
economi
built
on
american
manufactur
,
american
energi
,
skill
for
american
worker
,
and
a
renew
of
american
valu
.
now
,
thi
blueprint
begin
with
american
manufactur
.
on
the
day
i
took
offic
,
our
auto
industri
wa
on
the
verg
of
collaps
.
some
even
said
we
should
let
it
die
.
with
a
million
job
at
stake
,
i
refus
to
let
that
happen
.
in
exchang
for
help
,
we
demand
respons
.
we
got
worker
and
automak
to
settl
their
differ
.
we
got
the
industri
to
retool
and
restructur
.
today
,
gener
motor
is
back
on
top
as
the
world
's
number-on
automak
.
chrysler
ha
grown
faster
in
the
u.s.
than
ani
major
car
compani
.
ford
is
invest
billion
in
u.s.
plant
and
factori
.
and
togeth
,
the
entir
industri
ad
nearli
a
hundr
and
sixti
thousand
job
.
we
bet
on
american
worker
.
we
bet
on
american
ingenu
.
and
tonight
,
the
american
auto
industri
is
back
.
what
's
happen
in
detroit
can
happen
in
other
industri
.
it
can
happen
in
cleveland
and
pittsburgh
and
raleigh
.
we
ca
n't
bring
everi
job
back
that
's
left
our
shore
.
but
right
now
it
's
get
more
expens
to
do
busi
in
place
like
china
.
meanwhil
,
america
is
more
product
.
a
few
week
ago
,
the
ceo
of
master
lock
told
me
that
it
now
make
busi
sens
for
him
to
bring
job
back
home
.
today
,
for
the
first
time
in
15
year
,
master
lock
's
union
plant
in
milwauke
is
run
at
full
capac
.
so
we
have
a
huge
opportun
at
thi
moment
to
bring
manufactur
back
.
but
we
have
to
seiz
it
.
tonight
my
messag
to
busi
leader
is
simpl
:
ask
yourselv
what
you
can
do
to
bring
job
back
to
your
countri
,
and
your
countri
will
do
everyth
we
can
to
help
you
succeed
.
we
should
start
with
our
tax
code
.
right
now
compani
get
tax
break
for
move
job
and
profit
oversea
.
meanwhil
,
compani
that
choos
to
stay
in
america
get
hit
with
one
of
the
highest
tax
rate
in
the
world
.
it
make
no
sens
,
and
everyon
know
it
.
so
let
's
chang
it
.
first
,
if
you
're
a
busi
that
want
to
outsourc
job
,
you
should
n't
get
a
tax
deduct
for
do
it
.
that
money
should
be
use
to
cover
move
expens
for
compani
like
master
lock
that
decid
to
bring
job
home
.
second
,
no
american
compani
should
be
abl
to
avoid
pay
it
fair
share
of
tax
by
move
job
and
profit
oversea
.
from
now
on
,
everi
multin
compani
should
have
to
pay
a
basic
minimum
tax
.
and
everi
penni
should
go
toward
lower
tax
for
compani
that
choos
to
stay
here
and
hire
here
in
america
.
third
,
if
you
're
an
american
manufactur
,
you
should
get
a
bigger
tax
cut
.
if
you
're
a
high-tech
manufactur
,
we
should
doubl
the
tax
deduct
you
get
for
make
your
product
here
.
and
if
you
want
to
reloc
in
a
commun
that
wa
hit
hard
when
a
factori
left
town
,
you
should
get
help
financ
a
new
plant
,
equip
,
or
train
for
new
worker
.
so
my
messag
is
simpl
:
it
is
time
to
stop
reward
busi
that
ship
job
oversea
,
and
start
reward
compani
that
creat
job
right
here
in
america
.
send
me
these
tax
reform
,
and
i
will
sign
them
right
away
.
we
're
also
make
it
easier
for
american
busi
to
sell
product
all
over
the
world
.
two
year
ago
,
i
set
a
goal
of
doubl
u.s.
export
over
5
year
.
with
the
bipartisan
trade
agreement
we
sign
into
law
,
we
're
on
track
to
meet
that
goal
ahead
of
schedul
.
and
soon
there
will
be
million
of
new
custom
for
american
good
in
panama
,
colombia
,
and
south
korea
.
soon
there
will
be
new
car
on
the
street
of
seoul
import
from
detroit
and
toledo
and
chicago
.
i
will
go
anywher
in
the
world
to
open
new
market
for
american
product
.
and
i
will
not
stand
by
when
our
competitor
do
n't
play
by
the
rule
.
we
've
brought
trade
case
against
china
at
nearli
twice
the
rate
as
the
last
administr
,
and
it
's
made
a
differ
.
over
a
thousand
american
are
work
today
becaus
we
stop
a
surg
in
chines
tire
.
but
we
need
to
do
more
.
it
's
not
right
when
anoth
countri
let
our
movi
,
music
,
and
softwar
be
pirat
.
it
's
not
fair
when
foreign
manufactur
have
a
leg
up
on
our
onli
becaus
they
're
heavili
subsid
.
tonight
i
'm
announc
the
creation
of
a
trade
enforc
unit
that
will
be
charg
with
investig
unfair
trade
practic
in
countri
like
china
.
there
will
be
more
inspect
to
prevent
counterfeit
or
unsaf
good
from
cross
our
border
.
and
thi
congress
should
make
sure
that
no
foreign
compani
ha
an
advantag
over
american
manufactur
when
it
come
to
access
financ
or
new
market
like
russia
.
our
worker
are
the
most
product
on
earth
,
and
if
the
play
field
is
level
,
i
promis
you
,
america
will
alway
win
.
i
also
hear
from
mani
busi
leader
who
want
to
hire
in
the
unit
state
,
but
can't
find
worker
with
the
right
skill
.
grow
industri
in
scienc
and
technolog
have
twice
as
mani
open
as
we
have
worker
who
can
do
the
job
.
think
about
that
:
open
at
a
time
when
million
of
american
are
look
for
work
.
it
's
inexcus
,
and
we
know
how
to
fix
it
.
jacki
bray
is
a
singl
mom
from
north
carolina
who
wa
laid
off
from
her
job
as
a
mechan
.
then
siemen
open
a
ga
turbin
factori
in
charlott
and
form
a
partnership
with
central
piedmont
commun
colleg
.
the
compani
help
the
colleg
design
cours
in
laser
and
robot
train
.
it
paid
jacki
's
tuition
,
then
hire
her
to
help
oper
their
plant
.
i
want
everi
american
look
for
work
to
have
the
same
opportun
as
jacki
did
.
join
me
in
a
nation
commit
to
train
2
million
american
with
skill
that
will
lead
directli
to
a
job
.
my
administr
ha
alreadi
line
up
more
compani
that
want
to
help
.
model
partnership
between
busi
like
siemen
and
commun
colleg
in
place
like
charlott
and
orlando
and
louisvil
are
up
and
run
.
now
you
need
to
give
more
commun
colleg
the
resourc
they
need
to
becom
commun
career
center
,
place
that
teach
peopl
skill
that
busi
are
look
for
right
now
,
from
data
manag
to
high-tech
manufactur
.
and
i
want
to
cut
through
the
maze
of
confus
train
program
so
that
from
now
on
,
peopl
like
jacki
have
one
program
,
one
web
site
,
and
one
place
to
go
for
all
the
inform
and
help
that
they
need
.
it
is
time
to
turn
our
unemploy
system
into
a
reemploy
system
that
put
peopl
to
work
.
these
reform
will
help
peopl
get
job
that
are
open
today
.
but
to
prepar
for
the
job
of
tomorrow
,
our
commit
to
skill
and
educ
ha
to
start
earlier
.
for
less
than
1
percent
of
what
our
nation
spend
on
educ
each
year
,
we
've
convinc
nearli
everi
state
in
the
countri
to
rais
their
standard
for
teach
and
learn
,
the
first
time
that
's
happen
in
a
gener
.
but
challeng
remain
,
and
we
know
how
to
solv
them
.
at
a
time
when
other
countri
are
doubl
down
on
educ
,
tight
budget
have
forc
state
to
lay
off
thousand
of
teacher
.
we
know
a
good
teacher
can
increas
the
lifetim
incom
of
a
classroom
by
over
$
250,000
.
a
great
teacher
can
offer
an
escap
from
poverti
to
the
child
who
dream
beyond
hi
circumst
.
everi
person
in
thi
chamber
can
point
to
a
teacher
who
chang
the
trajectori
of
their
live
.
most
teacher
work
tirelessli
,
with
modest
pay
,
sometim
dig
into
their
own
pocket
for
school
suppli
,
just
to
make
a
differ
.
teacher
matter
.
so
instead
of
bash
them
or
defend
the
statu
quo
,
let
's
offer
school
a
deal
.
give
them
the
resourc
to
keep
good
teacher
on
the
job
and
reward
the
best
one
.
and
in
return
,
grant
school
flexibl
to
teach
with
creativ
and
passion
,
to
stop
teach
to
the
test
,
and
to
replac
teacher
who
just
are
n't
help
kid
learn
.
that
's
a
bargain
worth
make
.
we
also
know
that
when
student
do
n't
walk
away
from
their
educ
,
more
of
them
walk
the
stage
to
get
their
diploma
.
when
student
are
not
allow
to
drop
out
,
they
do
better
.
so
tonight
i
am
propos
that
everi
state—everi
state—requir
that
all
student
stay
in
high
school
until
they
graduat
or
turn
18
.
when
kid
do
graduat
,
the
most
daunt
challeng
can
be
the
cost
of
colleg
.
at
a
time
when
american
owe
more
in
tuition
debt
than
credit
card
debt
,
thi
congress
need
to
stop
the
interest
rate
on
student
loan
from

also
need

and

have
to
do
their

recent
,
i
spoke
with
a

of

presid
who
have
done
just
that
.
some
school
redesign

to

some

the
point
is
,
it
's
possibl
.
so
let
me
put
colleg
and
univers
on
notic
:
if
you
ca
n't
stop

up
,
the

will
go

.

it
is
an

that
everi

let
's
also
rememb
that
hundr
of
thousand
of
talent

hard-work

face
anoth
challeng
:
the
fact
that
they
are
n't
yet
american

.
mani
were
brought
here
as
small
children
,
are
american
through

yet
they
live
everi

with
the
threat
of
deport
.
other
came
more
recent
,
to

scienc
and

,
but
as
soon
as
they
get

we
send
them
home
to
invent
new

and
creat
new

somewher
els

that
doe
n't
make

.
i
believ
as
strongli
as
ever
that
we
should
take
on
illeg
immigr
.
that
's
whi
my
administr
ha
put
more

on

than
ever
befor

that
's
whi
there
are
fewer

when
i
took

the
oppon
of

are
out

we
should
be
work
on

immigr

right
now
.
but
if
election-year

keep

let'
at

agre
to

start

defend

.
send
me
a

that
give
them
the
chanc
to
earn
their

.
i
will
sign
it
right
away
.
you
see
,
an
economi
built
to
last
is
one
where
we
encourag
the
talent
and
ingenu
of
everi
person
in
thi
countri
.
that
mean
women
should
earn
equal
pay
for
equal

.
it
mean
we
should
support
everyon
who
's

and
everi

and
entrepreneur
who
aspir
to
becom
the

after
all
,
innov
is
what
america
ha
alway
been
about
.
most
new

are
creat
in

small

so
let
's
pass
an

that
help

tear
down

that
prevent
aspir

from
get
the

expand

to

creat

.
both
parti
agre
on
these
idea
.
so
put
them
in
a
bill
and
get
it
on
my
desk
thi

.
innov
also
demand
basic

.
today
,
the

do

these

do
n't
let

support
the

that
led
to

,
to

and
nowher
is
the

over
the
last
3
year
,
we
've
open
million
of
new

for

explor
,
and
tonight
i
'm
direct
my

right
now—right
now—american

is
the
highest
that
it
's
been

that
's
right
,
8
year
.
not
onli
that
,
last
year
,
we
reli
less
on
foreign
oil
than
in

of
the
past
16

.
but
with
onli
2
percent
of
the

's

.
thi

a

we
have
a

.
and
my

will
take
everi

expert
believ
thi

support
more
than
600,000

and
i'm
requir
all
compani
that
drill
for

to
disclos
the

becaus
america
will
develop
thi

without
put
the
health

safeti

.
the
develop
of

will
creat

and
power
truck
and
factori
that

prove
that

that
help

,
remind
us
that

is
critic
in
help

get

idea
off

.
now
,
what
's
true
for
natur

is
just
as
true
for
clean
energi
.
in
3
year
,
our
partnership
with
the

ha
alreadi
posit

when

he

he

befor

today

it

bryan

who
said

``

''
our

our

show
us
that
the

some

i

i

we

that
's

it
's

pass

creat

we
can
also
spur

the
differ
in
thi

may
be
too
deep
right
now
to
pass
a

to

but
there
's
no
reason
whi
congress
should
n't
at

set
a
clean

standard
that
creat
a

for

so
far
,
you
have

well
,
tonight
i

i'm
direct
my

to
allow
the
develop
of

on

to

and
i
'm
proud
to
announc
that
the

work
with

,
the
world
's
largest

will
make
one
of

with

of

,
the
easiest
way
to
save
money
is
to
wast
less

.
so
here
's
a
propos
:
help
manufactur
elimin
energi
wast
in
their
factori
and
give
busi
incent
to
upgrad
their

.
their
energi
bill
will
be
a
hundr
billion
dollar
lower
over
the
next
decad
,
and
america
will
have
less
pollut
,
more
manufactur
,
more
job
for
construct
worker
who
need
them
.
send
me
a
bill
that
creat
these

build
thi
new

futur
should
be
just
one
part
of
a
broader

to
repair
america

so
much
of
america
need
to
be
rebuilt
.
we
've
got
crumbl

bridg
,
a
power

that
wast
too
much

an

that
prevent
a

in

from

after

that

from
the

who
built

to
the

still

today
.
in
the

,
i
will
sign
an
execut
order
clear
away
the

that
slow
down
too
mani

but
you
need
to
fund
these
project
.
take
the
money
we
're
no
longer
spend
at
war
,
use
half
of
it
to
pay
down
our
debt
,
and
use
the
rest
to
do
some
nation-build
right
here
at
home
.
there
's
never
been
a
better
time
to
build
,
especi
sinc
the
construct

wa
one
of
the
hardest
hit
when
the

burst
.
of

,
construct
worker
were
n't
the
onli
one
who
were
hurt
.
so
were
million
of
innoc
american
who
've
seen
their

valu
declin
.
and
while
govern
ca
n't
fix
the
problem
on
it
own
,
respons
homeown
should
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
for
the
hous
market
to
hit
bottom
to
get
some
relief
.
and
that
's
whi
i
'm
send
thi
congress
a
plan
that
give
everi
respons
homeown
the
chanc
to
save
about
$
3,000
a

on
their

by
refinanc
at
histor
low

.
no
more
redtap
.
no
more
runaround
from
the
bank
.
a
small
fee
on
the
largest
financi

will
ensur
that
it
wo
n't
add

and
will
give
those
bank
that
were
rescu
by
taxpay
a
chanc
to
repay
a
deficit
of

.
let
's
never
forget
:
million
of
american
who
work
hard
and
play
by
the
rule
everi

deserv
a
govern
and
a
financi

that
do
the

.
it
's
time
to
appli
the

no

and
no

an

we
've

for

who
could
n't

them
and
buyer

that
's

,
these
do
n't
destroy
the

.
they
make
the
free

work
better
.
there
's
no
question
that
some
regul
are
outdat

unnecessari

or
too
costli
.
in
fact
,
i
've
approv
fewer
regul
in
the
first
3
year
of
my

than
my
republican
predecessor
did
in

.
i
've
order
everi

to
elimin

that
do
n't
make

we
've
alreadi
announc
over
500

and
just
a
fraction
of
them
will
save
busi
and
citizen
more
than
$
10
billion
over
the
next
5
year
.
we
got
rid
of
one
rule
from
40
year
ago
that
could
have
forc
some
dairi
farmer
to
spend
$
10,000
a

prove
that
they
could
contain
a
spill
,
becaus
milk
wa
somehow
classifi
as
an

with
a
rule
like
that
,
i
guess
it
wa
worth
cri
over
spill

.
[

now
,
i
'm
confid
a
farmer
can
contain
a
milk
spill
without
a
feder

look
over

.
absolut
.
but
i
will
not
back
down
from
make
sure
an
oil
compani
can
contain
the
kind
of
oil
spill
we
saw
in
the
gulf
2
year
ago
.
i
will
not
back
down
from
protect
our
kid
from
mercuri
poison
or
make
sure
that
our
food
is
safe
and
our
water
is
clean
.
i
will
not
go
back
to
the
day
when

had
uncheck

to
cancel

and
i
will
not
go
back
to
the

when

of

the
new

we
pass
restor
what
should
be

's
core
purpos
:
get

get
loan
to
respons
famili
who
want
to
buy
a
home
or
start
a
busi
or
send
their
kid
to
colleg
.
so
if
you
are
a
big
bank
or
financi

,
you
're
no
longer
allow
to
make
riski
bet
with

you

that

how
you
'll
pay

if

becaus
the

and
if
you
're
a

,
the

those

today

american

have
a

in

with

to

we
'll
also
establish
a

of

to
crack
down
on

and
protect

some

becaus
there
's

that'
bad

and
it
's
bad
for
the
vast
major
of

who
do

so
pass

make

and
tonight
i
'm
ask
my

thi

help
turn

now

a

our
peopl
and
our
economi
.
but
it
should
also
guid
us
as
we
look
to
pay
down
our
debt
and
invest
in
our
futur
.
right
now
our
most
immedi
prioriti
is
stop
a
tax
hike
on
a
hundr
and
sixti
million
work
american
while
the
recoveri
is
still
fragil
.
peopl
can
not
afford
lose
$
40
out
of
each
paycheck
thi
year
.
there
are
plenti
of
way
to
get
thi
done
.
so
let
's
agre
right
here
,
right
now
.
no
side
issu
.
no
drama
.
pass
the
payrol
tax
cut
without
delay
.
let
's
get
it
done
.
when
it
come
to
the
deficit
,
we
've
alreadi
agre
to
more
than
$
2
trillion
in
cut
and
save
.
but
we
need
to
do
more
,
and
that
mean
make
choic
.
right
now
we
're
pois
to
spend
nearli
$
1
trillion
more
on
what
wa
suppos
to
be
a
temporari
tax
break
for
the
wealthiest
2
percent
of
american
.
right
now
becaus
of
loophol
and
shelter
in
the
tax
code
,
a
quarter
of
all
millionair
pay
lower
tax
rate
than
million
of
middl
class
household
.
right
now
warren
buffett
pay
a
lower
tax
rate
than
hi
secretari
.
do
we
want
to
keep
these
tax
cut
for
the
wealthiest
american
?
or
do
we
want
to
keep
our
invest
in
everyth
els
,
like
educ
and
medic
research
,
a
strong
militari
and
care
for
our
veteran
?
becaus
if
we
're
seriou
about
pay
down
our
debt
,
we
can't
do
both
.
the
american
peopl
know
what
the
right
choic
is
.
so
do
i
.
as
i
told
the
speaker
thi
summer
,
i
'm
prepar
to
make
more
reform
that
rein
in
the
long-term
cost
of
medicar
and
medicaid
and
strengthen
social
secur
,
so
long
as
those
program
remain
a
guarante
of
secur
for
senior
.
but
in
return
,
we
need
to
chang
our
tax
code
so
that
peopl
like
me
,
and
an
aw
lot
of
member
of
congress
,
pay
our
fair
share
of
tax
.
tax
reform
should
follow
the
buffett
rule
.
if
you
make
more
than
a
million
dollar
a
year
,
you
should
not
pay
less
than
30
percent
in
tax
.
and
my
republican
friend
tom
coburn
is
right
:
washington
should
stop
subsid
millionair
.
in
fact
,
if
you'r
earn
a
million
dollar
a
year
,
you
should
n't
get
special
tax
subsidi
or
deduct
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
you
make
under
$
250,000
a
year
,
like
98
percent
of
american
famili
,
your
tax
should
n't
go
up
.
you
're
the
one
struggl
with
rise
cost
and
stagnant
wage
.
you
're
the
one
who
need
relief
.
now
,
you
can
call
thi
class
warfar
all
you
want
.
but
ask
a
billionair
to
pay
at
least
as
much
as
hi
secretari
in
tax
?
most
american
would
call
that
common
sens
.
we
do
n't
begrudg
financi
success
in
thi
countri
.
we
admir
it
.
when
american
talk
about
folk
like
me
pay
my
fair
share
of
tax
,
it
's
not
becaus
they
envi
the
rich
.
it
's
becaus
they
understand
that
when
i
get
a
tax
break
i
do
n't
need
and
the
countri
ca
n't
afford
,
it
either
add
to
the
deficit
or
somebodi
els
ha
to
make
up
the
differ
,
like
a
senior
on
a
fix
incom
or
a
student
tri
to
get
through
school
or
a
famili
tri
to
make
end
meet
.
that
's
not
right
.
american
know
that
's
not
right
.
they
know
that
thi
gener
's
success
is
onli
possibl
becaus
past
gener
felt
a
respons
to
each
other
and
to
the
futur
of
their
countri
,
and
they
know
our
way
of
life
will
onli
endur
if
we
feel
that
same
sens
of
share
respons
.
that
's
how
we
'll
reduc
our
deficit
.
that
's
an
america
built
to
last
.
now
,
i
recogn
that
peopl
watch
tonight
have
differ
view
about
tax
and
debt
,
energi
and
health
care
.
but
no
matter
what
parti
they
belong
to
,
i
bet
most
american
are
think
the
same
thing
right
about
now
:
noth
will
get
done
in
washington
thi
year
or
next
year
or
mayb
even
the
year
after
that
,
becaus
washington
is
broken
.
can
you
blame
them
for
feel
a
littl
cynic
?
the
greatest
blow
to
our
confid
in
our
economi
last
year
did
n't
come
from
event
beyond
our
control
.
it
came
from
a
debat
in
washington
over
whether
the
unit
state
would
pay
it
bill
or
not
.
who
benefit
from
that
fiasco
?
i
've
talk
tonight
about
the
deficit
of
trust
between
main
street
and
wall
street
.
but
the
divid
between
thi
citi
and
the
rest
of
the
countri
is
at
least
as
bad
,
and
it
seem
to
get
wors
everi
year
.
now
,
some
of
thi
ha
to
do
with
the
corros
influenc
of
money
in
polit
.
so
togeth
,
let
's
take
some
step
to
fix
that
.
send
me
a
bill
that
ban
insid
trade
by
member
of
congress
.
i
will
sign
it
tomorrow
.
let
's
limit
ani
elect
offici
from
own
stock
in
industri
they
impact
.
let
's
make
sure
peopl
who
bundl
campaign
contribut
for
congress
ca
n't
lobbi
congress
and
vice
versa
,
an
idea
that
ha
bipartisan
support
,
at
least
outsid
of
washington
.
some
of
what
's
broken
ha
to
do
with
the
way
congress
doe
it
busi
these
day
.
a
simpl
major
is
no
longer
enough
to
get
anything—even
routin
business—pass
through
the
senat
.
neither
parti
ha
been
blameless
in
these
tactic
.
now
both
parti
should
put
an
end
to
it
.
for
starter
,
i
ask
the
senat
to
pass
a
simpl
rule
that
all
judici
and
public
servic
nomin
receiv
a
simpl
up-or-down
vote
within
90
day
.
the
execut
branch
also
need
to
chang
.
too
often
,
it
's
ineffici
,
outdat
,
and
remot
.
that
's
whi
i
've
ask
thi
congress
to
grant
me
the
author
to
consolid
the
feder
bureaucraci
so
that
our
govern
is
leaner
,
quicker
,
and
more
respons
to
the
need
of
the
american
peopl
.
final
,
none
of
thi
can
happen
unless
we
also
lower
the
temperatur
in
thi
town
.
we
need
to
end
the
notion
that
the
two
parti
must
be
lock
in
a
perpetu
campaign
of
mutual
destruct
,
that
polit
is
about
cling
to
rigid
ideolog
instead
of
build
consensu
around
commonsens
idea
.
i
'm
a
democrat
,
but
i
believ
what
republican
abraham
lincoln
believ
:
that
govern
should
do
for
peopl
onli
what
they
can
not
do
better
by
themselv
and
no
more
.
that'
whi
my
educ
reform
offer
more
competit
and
more
control
for
school
and
state
.
that
's
whi
we
're
get
rid
of
regul
that
do
n't
work
.
that
's
whi
our
health
care
law
reli
on
a
reform
privat
market
,
not
a
govern
program
.
on
the
other
hand
,
even
my
republican
friend
who
complain
the
most
about
govern
spend
have
support
feder
financ
road
and
clean
energi
project
and
feder
offic
for
the
folk
back
home
.
the
point
is
,
we
should
all
want
a
smarter
,
more
effect
govern
.
and
while
we
may
not
be
abl
to
bridg
our
biggest
philosoph
differ
thi
year
,
we
can
make
real
progress
.
with
or
without
thi
congress
,
i
will
keep
take
action
that
help
the
economi
grow
.
but
i
can
do
a
whole
lot
more
with
your
help
.
becaus
when
we
act
togeth
,
there
's
noth
the
unit
state
of
america
ca
n't
achiev
.
that
's
the
lesson
we
've
learn
from
our
action
abroad
over
the
last
few
year
.
end
the
iraq
war
ha
allow
us
to
strike
decis
blow
against
our
enemi
.
from
pakistan
to
yemen
,
the
al
qaida
oper
who
remain
are
scrambl
,
know
that
they
can't
escap
the
reach
of
the
unit
state
of
america
.
from
thi
posit
of
strength
,
we
've
begun
to
wind
down
the
war
in
afghanistan
.
ten
thousand
of
our
troop
have
come
home
.
twenty-thre
thousand
more
will
leav
by
the
end
of
thi
summer
.
thi
transit
to
afghan
lead
will
continu
,
and
we
will
build
an
endur
partnership
with
afghanistan
so
that
it
is
never
again
a
sourc
of
attack
against
america
.
as
the
tide
of
war
reced
,
a
wave
of
chang
ha
wash
across
the
middl
east
and
north
africa
,
from
tuni
to
cairo
,
from

a

qadhafi

a

with
american
blood
on

today
,
he
is
gone
.
and
in
syria
,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
asad
regim
will
soon
discov
that
the
forc
of
chang
can
not
be
revers
and
that
human
digniti
can
not
be
deni
.
how
thi
incred
transform
will
end
remain
uncertain
.
but
we
have
a
huge
stake
in
the
outcom
.
and
while
it
's
ultim
up
to
the
peopl
of
the
region
to
decid
their
fate
,
we
will
advoc
for
those
valu
that
have
serv
our

countri
so
well
.
we
will
stand
against
violenc

we
will
stand
for
the
right
and
digniti
of
all
human
be
:
men
and

;
christian

muslim
,
and
jew
.
we
will
support
polici
that
lead
to
strong
and
stabl
democraci
and
open
market
,
becaus
tyranni
is
no
match
for

and
we
will
safeguard
america
's

secur
against
those
who
threaten
our

our

and
our

look
at

through
the
power
of
our

,
a
world
that
wa

about
how
to
deal

as

the

it

and
as
long
as
they
shirk
their

thi
pressur
will
not

let
there
be
no
doubt
:
america
is
determin
to
prevent
iran
from
get
a
nuclear
weapon
,
and
i
will
take
no
option
off
the
tabl
to
achiev
that
goal
.
but
a
peac
resolut
of
thi
issu
is
still
possibl
,
and
far
better
.
and
if
iran
chang
cours
and
meet
it
oblig
,
it
can
rejoin
the

.
the
renew
of
american

can
be
felt
across

.
our

allianc
in

are
stronger
than
ever

our
tie
to
the
america
are
deeper
.
our
ironclad
commitment—and
i
mean
ironclad—to
israel
's
secur
ha
meant
the
closest
militari
cooper
between
our
two
countri
in
histori
.
we
've
made
it
clear
that
america
is
a
pacif
power
,
and
a
new

in
burma
ha
lit
a
new

from

we
've
built

to
the

that

i

that
's
whi

work

while
save
nearli
half
a

to

i
've

abov

our

endur
becaus
of
the
men

who
defend

as
they
come

we
must
serv

as
well
as
they
've

that
includ
give

the

the

they
have
earn
,
which
is
whi
we
've
increas
annual
va
spend
everi
year
i
've
been
presid

and
it
mean
enlist
our
veteran
in
the
work
of
rebuild
our
nation
.
with
the
bipartisan
support
of
thi
congress
,
we
're
provid

michel

have
work
with

busi
to
secur
a
pledg
of
135,000
job
for

and
tonight
i'm
propos
a
veteran
job
corp
that
will
help
our
commun
hire
veteran
as
cop
and
firefight
,
so
that
america
is
as
strong
as
those
who
defend
her
.
which
bring
me
back
to
where
i
began
.
those
of
us
who
've
been
sent
here
to
serv
can
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
the
servic
of
our
troop
.
when
you
put
on
that
uniform
,
it
doe
n't
matter
if
you
're
black
or
white
,
asian
,
latino
,
nativ
american
;
conserv
,
liber
;
rich

straight

when
you
're
march
into

,
you
look
out
for
the
person
next
to
you
or
the
mission
fail
.
when
you
're
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
,
you
rise
or
fall
as
one
unit
,
serv
one
nation
,
leav
no
one
behind
.
you
know
,
one
of
my
proudest
possess
is
the
flag
that
the
seal
team
took
with
them
on
the
mission
to
get
bin
laden
.
on
it
are
each
of
their
name
.
some
may
be
democrat
,
some
may
be
republican
,
but
that
doe
n't
matter
.
just
like
it
did
n't
matter
that
day
in
the
situat
room
,
when
i
sat
next
to
bob
gate
,
a
man
who
wa
georg
bush
's
defens
secretari
,
and
hillari
clinton
,
a
woman
who
ran
against
me
for
presid
.
all
that
matter
that
day
wa
the
mission
.
no
one
thought
about
polit
.
no
one
thought
about
themselv
.
one
of
the
young
men
involv
in
the
raid
later
told
me
that
he
didn't
deserv
credit
for
the
mission
.
it
onli
succeed
,
he
said
,
becaus
everi
singl
member
of
that
unit
did
their
job
:
the
pilot
who
land
the
helicopt
that
spun
out
of
control
,
the
translat
who
kept
other
from
enter
the
compound
,
the
troop
who
separ
the
women
and
children
from
the
fight
,
the
seal
who
charg
up
the
stair
.
more
than
that
,
the
mission
onli
succeed
becaus
everi
member
