though
often
in

their
safeti

by
no

our

left
noth

the
deep

have
been

not

we

made

the
fact
as
they
now
appear

not
permit
us
to
doubt
the
justic
of
these
claim

and
noth
will
be

about

from

permit
the

it
is
hope
that
hereaft
no

prevent

all
it

it
is
difficult
to
perceiv
that
ani
progress
ha
thu
far
been
made
toward
the
pacif

that
the
situat

the

if

determin

to

is
evinc
by
her
unhesit

there
is
much

which
plainli

no

under

would
have

unquestion
evinc
no

respect
and
regard
for

on

they
in

do
not

nor
do
they
underestim

still
hold
it

and
yet
neither
the
govern
nor
the
peopl
of
the

have
shut
their
eye
to
the
cours
of
event
in

or
have
fail
to
realiz
the

grievanc
which
have
led
to
the

from
the
author

grievanc
recogn

and
by

and
demonstr

propos
by

it
is
in
the
assum

and
disposit
of
the
spanish

to
remedi
these
grievanc

fortifi
by

and
with
the
achiev

all
the

of

it
would
seem
that
if
spain
should
offer
to
cuba
genuin
autonomi
--
a
measur
of
home
rule
which
,
while
preserv
the
sovereignti

,
would
satisfi
all
ration
requir
of

--
there
should
be
no
just
reason
whi
the
pacif

the
island
might
not
be
effect
on
that
basi

such
a
result
would
appear
to
be
in
the
true
interest
of
all
concern
.
it
would
at
onc
stop
the
conflict
which
is
now
consum
the
resourc
of
the
island
and
make
it
worthless
for
whichev
parti
may
ultim

.
it
would
keep
intact
the
possess
of
spain
without
touch
her
honor
,
which
will
be
consult
rather
than
impugn
by
the
adequ

of
admit

.
it
would
put
the
prosper
of
the
island
and
the
fortun
of
it
inhabit
within
their
own
control
without
sever
the
natur
and
ancient
tie
which
bind
them
to
the
mother
countri
,
and
would
yet
enabl
them
to
test
their
capac
for
self-govern
under
the
most

it
ha
been
object
on
the
one
side
that
spain
should
not
promis
autonomi
until
her
insurg

lay
down
their

on

that

as
well
as
on

own
account
that
the
cuban
problem
should
be
solv
with
the
least
possibl
delay
,
it
wa
intim
by
thi
govern
to
the
govern
of

some
month

that
if
a

would
be

upon

the

would

of
furnish

graranti

while
no
definit

thi
intim
ha
yet
been
receiv

the
spanish

,
it
is
believ
to
be
not
altogeth
unwelcom

while
,
as
alreadi
suggest
,
no
reason
is
perceiv
whi
it
should
not
be
approv
by
the
insurg
.
neither
parti
can
fail
to
see
the
import
of
earli

and
both
must
realiz
that
to
prolong
the

it

when
it
is
understood
that
a
masonri

furnish
a

for
the
heavi
modern
high-pow

,
but
also
in

serv
the

and
take
the
place
of
the
fort
of
former

,
the
import
of
the
work

is
better
comprehend
.
in
the
hope
that
the
work
will
be
prosecut
with
no
less
vigor
in
the
futur
,
the
secretari
of

ha
submit
an

if

not

from
one-third
of

to
be
done
under

adopt
for

thu
afford
a
prospect
that
the

will
be
substanti

within

in

time
than
that
,
howev
,
we
shall
have
attain
a

of

the
experi

result
of
the
past

demonstr
that
with
a
continu

the
cost
of

will
be
much
less
than

we
should
alway
keep
in

that

is
essenti

in

while
it
give
the
sens
of
secur
due
to
a
conscious
of
strength
,
it
is
neither
the
purpos
nor
the
effect
of
such
perman
fortif
to
involv
us
in
foreign
complic
,
but
rather
to
guarante
us
against

.
they
are
not
temptat
to

,

secur
against

thu
they
are
thoroughli
in

the
attorney-gener
present
a
detail
and
interest
statement
of
the
import
work
done
under
hi
supervis
dure
the
last
fiscal

.
the
ownership
and
manag
by
the
govern
of
penitentiari
for
the
confin
of
those
convict
in
unit
state
court
of
violat
of

,
which
for
mani
year
ha
been
a
subject
of
execut

,
have
at
last
to
a
slight
extent
been
realiz
by
the
util
of
the
abandon
militari
prison
at
fort
leavenworth
as
a
unit
state
penitentiari
.
thi
is
certainli
a
movement
in
the
right
direct
,
but
it
ought
to
be
at
onc
supplement
by
the
rebuild
or
extens
enlarg
of
thi
improvis
prison
and
the
construct
of
at
least
one
more

to
be
locat
in
the
southern
state
.
the
capac
of
the
leavenworth
penitentiari
is
so
limit
that
the
expens
of
it
mainten
,
calcul
at
a
per

rate
upon
the
number
of

it

not
make
as
econom
an

as
it
would
if
it
were
larger
and
better
adapt

purpos
;
but
i
am
thoroughli
convinc
that
economi
,
human
,
and
a
proper
sens
of
respons
and
duti
toward
those
whom
we
punish
for
violat
of
feder
law
dictat
that
the
feder
govern
should
have
the
entir
control
and
manag
of
the
penitentiari
where
convict
violat
are
confin
.
it
appear
that
sinc

transfer
of

ha

thi

consist
of
the

on
all
ground
it
is
exceedingli
desir
that

be
allow
to
resum

of

it

if

experi

demonstr
that

involv

follow
reform

i
earnestli
recommend

there
should
be
a
small

servic
,
to
be
employ
in
the
supervis
of
the

,
which
now
number
13,000
men
and
perform
it
servic
practic
without
the
surveil
exercis
over
all
other
branch
of
the
postal
or
public
servic
.
of
cours
such
a
lack
of
supervis
and
freedom
from
wholesom
disciplinari
restraint
must
inevit
lead
to
imperfect
servic
.
there
should
also
be
appoint
a
few
inspector
who
could
assist
the
central
offic
in
necessari
investig
concern
matter
of
post-offic
leas

allow

secur
the
best
result
from
the
work
of
the
14,000
clerk
now
employ
in
first

second

.
i
am
convinc
that
the
small
expens
attend
the
inaugur

these
reform
would
actual
be
a
profit

i
especi
recommend

a

the
depart
of
agricultur
is
so
intim
relat
to
the
welfar
of
our
peopl
and
the
prosper
of
our
nation
that
it
should
constantli
receiv
the
care
and
encourag
of
the
govern
.
from
small
begin
it
ha
grown
to
be
the
center
of
agricultur
intellig
and
the
sourc
of
aid
and
encourag
to
agricultur
effort
.
larg
sum
of
money
are
annual
appropri
for
the
mainten
of
thi
depart
,
and
it
must
be
confess
that
the
legisl
relat
to
it
ha
not
alway
been
directli
in
the
interest
of
practic
farm
or
properli
guard
against
wast
and
extravag
.
so
far
,
howev
,
as
public
money
ha
been
appropri
fairli
and
sensibl
to
help
those
who
actual
till
the
soil
,
no
expenditur
ha
been
more
profit
made
or
more
gener
approv
by
the
peopl
.
under
the
present
manag
of
the
depart
it
use
ha
been
enhanc
in
everi
direct
,
and
at
the
same
time
strict
economi
ha
been
enforc
to
the
utmost
extent
permit
by
congression
action
.
from
the
report
of
the
secretari
it
appear
that
through
care
and
prudent
financi
manag
he
ha
annual
save
a
larg
sum
from
hi
appropri
,
aggreg
dure
hi
incumb
and
up
to
the
close
of
the
present
fiscal
year
nearli
one-fifth
of
the
entir
amount
appropri
.
these
result
have
been
accomplish
by
a
conscienti
studi
of
the
real
need
of
the
farmer
and
such
a
regard
for
economi
as
the
genuin
farmer
ought
to
appreci
,
supplement
by
a
rigid
adher
to
civil-servic
method
in
a
depart
which
should
be
conduct
in
the
interest
of
agricultur
instead
of
partisan
polit
.
the
secretari
report
that
the
valu
of
our
export
of
farm
product
dure
the
last
fiscal
year
amount
to
$
570,000,000
,
an
increas
of
$
17,000,000
over
those
of
the
year
immedi
preced
.
thi
statement
is
not
the
less
welcom
becaus
of
the
fact
that
,
notwithstand
such
increas
,
the
proport
of
export
agricultur
product
to
our
total
export
of
all
descript
fell
off
dure
the
year
.
the
benefit
of
an
increas
in
agricultur
export
be
assur
,
the
decreas
in
it
proport
to
our
total
export
is
the
more
gratifi
when
we
consid
that
it
is
owe
to
the
fact
that
such
total
export
for
the
year
increas
more
than
$
75,000,000
.
the
larg
and
increas
export
of
our
agricultur
product
suggest
the
great
use
of
the
organ
late
establish
in
the
depart
for
the
purpos
of
give

those
engag

the
condit

and

.
inasmuch
as
the
success
of
the
farmer
depend
upon
the
advantag
sale
of
hi
product
,
and
inasmuch
as
foreign
market
must
larg
be
the
destin
of
such
product
,
it
is
quit
appar
that
a
knowledg
of
the
condit
and
want
that
affect
those
market
ought
to
result
in
sow
more
intellig
and
reap
with
a

promis
of

.
such
inform
point
out
the
way
to
a
prudent
foresight
in
the
select
and
cultiv
of
crop
and
to
a

of

in
my
opinion
the
gratuit
distribut
of
seed
by
the
depart
as
at
present
conduct
ought
to
be
discontinu

no

i
believ
our

if

will
in

to

we

a

128,000,000

the

therefor

of

is
noth
more

to
the

of

not

to

to
a

it
is
not

of

with

.
the
applic

by

an

himself
with

or

either
unfortun

the
distinct
is
between
a

with
the
duti
of

for
the
benefit
of
the

and
for
proper

all

it

under

thi
is
a
matter
of

sinc
it
is
the
palpabl
duti
of
everi

to
make

the

without

repeat
these

i
can
not
refrain
from
again
earnestli
present
the
necess
of
the
prompt
reform
of
a

oppos
to
everi
rule
of
sound
financ
and
shown
by
experi
to
be
fraught
with
the
gravest
peril
and
perplex

the
terribl
civil
war
,
which
shook
the
foundat
of
our
govern
more
than
thirti
year
ago
,
brought
in
it
train
the
destruct
of
properti
,
the
wast
of
our
countri
's
substanc
,
and
the
estrang
of
brethren
.
these
are
now
past
and
forgotten
.
even
the
distress
loss
of
life
the
conflict
entail
is
but
a
sacr
memori
which
foster
patriot
sentiment
and
keep
aliv
a
tender
regard
for
those
who
nobli
die
.
and
yet
there
remain
with
us
to-day
in
full
strength
and
activ

as
an
incid

that
tremend
struggl

a

but
manifestli

an
ever-pres

of
monetari
distress
.
becaus
we
may
be
enjoy
a
temporari
relief
from
it
depress

,
thi
should
not
lull
us
into
a
fals
secur
nor
lead
us
to
forget
the
sudden
of
past
visit
.
i
am
more
convinc
than
ever
that
we
can
have
no
assur

and
safeti
until
the
govern
currenc
oblig
upon
which
gold
may
be

thi

as

by

a
low

or
by
their

such

even
if

is
probabl
that
the

1890

now

thi

i
am
of
the
opinion
that
we
have
place
too
much
stress
upon
the
danger
of

have
calcul
too

upon

it

the

that

anoth
topic
in
which
our
peopl
right
take
a
deep
interest
may
be
here
briefli
consid
.
i
refer
to
the
exist
of
trust
and
other
huge
aggreg
of
capit
the
object
of
which
is
to
secur
the
monopoli
of
some
particular
branch
of
trade
,
industri
,
or
commerc
and
to
stifl
wholesom
competit

when
these
are
defend

it
is
usual
on
the
ground
that
though
they
increas
profit
they
also
reduc
price
,
and
thu
may
benefit
the
public
.
it
must
be
rememb
,
howev
,
that
a
reduct
of
price
to
the
peopl
is
not
one
of
the
real
object
of
these
organ
,
nor
is
their
tendenc
necessarili
in
that
direct
.
if
it
occur
in
a
particular
case
it
is
onli
becaus
it
accord
with
the
purpos
or
interest
of
those
manag

.
such
occasion
result
fall
far
short
of
compens
the
palpabl
evil
charg
to
the
account
of
trust
and
monopoli
.
their
tendenc
is
to
crush
out
individu
independ
and
to
hinder
or
prevent
the
free
use
of
human
faculti
and
the
full
develop
of
human
charact
.
through
them
the
farmer
,
the
artisan
,
and
the
small
trader
is
in
danger
of
dislodg
from
the
proud
posit
of
be
hi
own
master
,
watch
of
all
that
touch
hi
countri

in
which
he
ha
an
individu

,
and

in
all
that
affect
the
advantag
of

of
which
he
is
a
factor
,
to
be
releg
to
the
level
of
a
mere
appurten
to
a
great
machin
,
with
littl
free
will
,
with
no
duti
but
that
of
passiv
obedi
,
and
with
littl
hope
or
opportun
of
rise
in
the
scale
of
respons
and
help
citizenship
.
to
the
instinct
belief
that
such
is
the
inevit
trend
of
trust
and
monopoli
is
due
the
widespread
and
deep-seat
popular
avers
in
which
they
are
held
and
the
not
unreason
insist
that
,
whatev
may

their

econom
advantag
,
their
gener
effect
upon
person
charact
,
prospect
,
and
use
can
not
be
otherwis
than
injuri
.
though
congress
ha
attempt
to
deal
with
thi
matter
by
legisl
,
the
law
pass
for
that
purpos
thu
far
have
prove
ineffect
,
not
becaus
of
ani
lack
of
disposit
or
attempt
to
enforc
them
,
but
simpli
becaus
the
law
themselv
as
interpret
by
the
court
do
not
reach
the
difficulti
.
if
the
insuffici
of
exist
law
can
be
remedi
by
further
legisl
,
it
should
be
done
.
the
fact
must
be
recogn
,
howev
,
that
all
feder
legisl
on
thi
subject
may
fall
short
of
it
purpos
becaus
of
inher
obstacl
and
also
becaus
of
the
complex
charact
of
our
government
system
,
which
,
while

suprem
within

,
ha
care
limit
that
sphere
by
mete
and
bound
that
can
not

the
decis
of
our
highest
court
on
thi
precis
question
render
it
quit
doubt
whether
the
evil
of
trust
and
monopoli
can
be
adequ
treat
through
feder
action
unless
they
seek
directli
and
purpos
to
includ
in
their
object
transport
or
intercours
between
state
or
between
the
unit
state
and
foreign
countri

it
doe
not
follow
,
howev
,
that
thi
is
the
limit
of
the
remedi
that
may
be
appli

even
though
it
may
be
found
that
feder
author
is
not
broad
enough
to
fulli
reach
the
case
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
power
of
the
sever
state
to
act
effect
in
the
premis
,
and
there
should
be
no
reason
to
doubt
their
willing
to
judici
exercis
such
power
.
in
conclud
thi
commun
it
last
word
shall
be
an
appeal
to
the
congress
for
the
most
rigid
economi
in
the
expenditur
of
the
money
it
hold
in
trust
for
the
peopl
.
the
way
to
perplex
extravag
is
easi
,
but
a
return
to
frugal
is
difficult
.
when
,
howev
,
it
is
consid
that
those
who
bear
the
burden
of
taxat
have
no
guaranti
of
honest
care
save
in
the
fidel
of
their
public
servant
,
the
duti
of
all
possibl
retrench
is
plainli
manifest
.
when
our
differ
are
forgotten
and
our
contest
of
polit
opinion
are
no
longer
rememb
,
noth
in
the
retrospect
of
our
public
servic
will
be
as
fortun
and
comfort
as
the
recollect
of
offici
duti
well
perform
and
the
memori
of
a
constant

to
the
