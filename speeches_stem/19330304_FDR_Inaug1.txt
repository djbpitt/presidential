presid
hoover
,
mr.
chief
justic
,
my
friend
:
thi
is
a
day
of
nation
consecr
.
and
i
am
certain
that
on
thi
day
my
fellow
american
expect
that
on
my
induct
into
the
presid
i
will
address
them
with
a
candor
and
a
decis
which
the
present
situat
of
our
peopl
impel
.
thi
is
preemin
the
time
to
speak
the
truth
,
the
whole
truth
,
frankli
and
boldli
.
nor
need
we
shrink
from
honestli
face
condit
in
our
countri
today
.
thi
great
nation
will
endur
as
it
ha
endur
,
will
reviv
and
will
prosper
.
so
,
first
of
all
,
let
me
assert
my
firm
belief
that
the
onli
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
itself—nameless
,
unreason
,
unjustifi
terror
which
paralyz
need
effort
to
convert
retreat
into
advanc
.
in
everi
dark
hour
of
our
nation
life
a
leadership
of
frank
and
vigor
ha
met
with
that
understand
and
support
of
the
peopl
themselv
which
is
essenti
to
victori
.
i
am
convinc
that
you
will
again
give
that
support
to
leadership
in
these
critic
day
.
in
such
a
spirit
on
my
part
and
on
your
we
face
our
common
difficulti
.

onli

we

final
,
in
our
progress
toward
a
resumpt
of
work
we
requir
two
safeguard
against
a
return
of
the
evil
of
the
old
order
:
there
must
be
a
strict
supervis
of
all
bank
and
credit
and
invest
,
so
that
there
will
be
an
end
to
specul
with
other
peopl
's
money
;
and
there
must
be
provis
for
an
adequ
but
sound
currenc
.
these
are
the
line
of
attack
.
i
shall
present
urg
upon
a
new
congress
,
in
special
session
,
detail
measur
for
their
fulfil
,
and
i
shall
seek
the
immedi
assist
of
the
sever
state
.
through
thi
program
of
action
we
address
ourselv
to
put
our
own
nation
hous
in
order
and
make
incom
balanc
outgo
.
our
intern
trade
relat
,
though
vastli

are
in

of

necess
secondari

establish
of

i
shall
spare
no

to
restor
world
trade
by
intern
econom
readjust
,
but
the
emerg
at
home
can
not
wait
on
that
accomplish
.
the
basic
thought
that
guid
these
specif
mean
of
nation
recoveri
is
not
narrowli
nationalist
.
it
is
the
insist
,
as
a
first
consider
,
upon
the
interdepend
of
the
variou
element
in
and
part
of
the
unit
states-a
recognit
of
the
old
and
perman
import
manifest
of
the
american
spirit
of
the
pioneer
.
it
is
the
way
to
recoveri
.
it
is
the
immedi
way
.
it
is
the
strongest
assur
that
the
recoveri
will
endur
.
in
the
field
of
world
polici
i
would
dedic
thi
nation
to
the
polici
of
the
good
neighbor—th
neighbor
who
resolut
respect
himself
and
,
becaus
he
doe
so
,
respect
the
right
of
others—th
neighbor
who
respect
hi
oblig
and
respect
the
sanctiti
of
hi
agreement
in
and
with
a
world
of
neighbor
.
if
i
read
the
temper
of
our
peopl
correctli
,
we
now
realiz
as
we
have
never
realiz
befor
our
interdepend
on

other
;
that
we
can
not
mere
take
but
we
must
give
as

;
that
if
we
are
to
go
forward
,
we
must
move
as
a
train
and
loyal
armi
will
to
sacrific
for
the
good
of

becaus
without
such

no

we
are

readi
and

becaus
it

feasibl
under

but
it
may
be
that
an

for

may
call
for
temporari
departur
from
that

i
am

to
recommend
the

these

but
in

take
one

and
in

event
that

i
shall
not
evad
the

i

ask

for

i
