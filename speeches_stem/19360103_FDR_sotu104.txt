intern

widespread
hope
for
the
better

gave
to

a
reason

to

in

:
``
i

sinc
the
summer
of

of

,
the
temper
and
the
purpos
of
the

not

have

grown
more
remot

dure
thi

a
point
ha
been
reach
where

take

to

the

,
there
are
ground
for
pessim

it
is
idl
for

for

to
preach
that
the

that

that

it
might
be

that

chang

polici
of

if
they
could

allow
full
freedom
and
full
access
to
the
process
of
democrat

as
we
understand
them
.
but
they
do
not
have
that
access
;
lack
it
they
follow
blindli
and
fervent
the
lead
of
those
who
seek

by

to

they
have
therefor
impati
revert
to
the
old
belief
in
the
law
of
the
sword
,
or
to
the
fantast
concept
that

are

that
all

i
recogn
and
you
will
recogn
that
these

i
have
chosen
with
deliber
will
not
prove
popular
in
ani

such
sentiment
,
howev
,
will
find
sympathi

understand
in
those
nation
where
the
peopl
themselv
are
honestli
desir
of

must
constantli
align
themselv
on

in

kaleidoscop
jockey
for

is
characterist
of

relat

for

there

find
that
their
veri

depend
on
their
move
and
move
again
on
the
chess
board
of
intern
polit
.
i
suggest
in
the
spring
of
1933
that
85
or
90
percent
of
all
the
peopl
in
the
world
were
content
with
the
territori
limit
of
their

nation
and
were
will
further
to
reduc
their
arm
forc
if
everi
other
nation
in
the
world
would
agre
to
do
likewis
.
that
is
equal
true
today
,
and
it
is
even
more
true
today
that
world
peac
and
world
good-wil
are
block
by
onli
10
or
15
percent
of
the
world
's
popul
.
that
is
whi
effort
to
reduc
armi
have
thu
far
not
onli
fail
,
but
have
been
met
by
vastli
increas
armament
on
land
and
in
the
air
.
that
is
whi
even
effort
to
continu
the
exist
limit
on
naval
armament
into
the
year
to
come
show
such
littl
current
success
.
but
the
polici
of
the
unit
state
ha
been
clear
and
consist
.
we
have
sought
with
earnest
in
everi
possibl
way
to
limit
world
armament
and
to
attain
the
peac
solut
of
disput
among
all
nation
.
we
have
sought
by
everi
legitim
mean
to
exert
our
moral
influenc
against
repress
,
against
intoler
,
against
autocraci
and
in
favor
of
freedom
of
express
,
equal
befor
the
law
,
religi
toler
and
popular
rule
.
in
the
field
of
commerc
we
have
undertaken
to
encourag
a
more
reason
interchang
of
the
world
's
good
.
in
the
field
of
intern
financ
we
have
,
so
far
as
we
are
concern
,
put
an
end
to
dollar
diplomaci
,
to
money
grab
,
to
specul
for
the
benefit
of
the
power
and
the
rich
,
at
the
expens
of
the
small
and
the
poor
.
as
a
consist
part
of
a
clear
polici
,
the
unit
state
is
follow
a
twofold
neutral
toward
ani
and
all
nation
which
engag
in
war
that
are
not
of
immedi
concern
to
the
america
.
first
,
we
declin
to
encourag
the
prosecut
of
war
by
permit
belliger
to
obtain
arm
,
ammunit
or
implement
of
war
from
the
unit
state
.
second
,
we
seek
to
discourag
the
use
by
belliger
nation
of
ani
and
all
american
product
calcul
to
facilit
the
prosecut
of
a
war
in
quantiti
over
and
abov
our
normal
export
of
them
in
time
of
peac
.
i
trust
that
these
object
thu
clearli
and
unequivoc
state
will
be
carri
forward
by
cooper
between
thi
congress
and
the
presid
.
i
realiz
that
i
have
emphas
to
you
the
graviti
of
the
situat
which
confront
the
peopl
of
the
world
.
thi
emphasi
is
justifi
becaus
of
it
import
to
civil
and
therefor
to
the
unit
state
.
peac
is
jeopard
by
the
few
and
not
by
the
mani
.
peac
is
threaten
by
those
who
seek
selfish
power
.
the
world
ha
wit
similar
eras—
as
in
the
day
when
petti
king
and
feudal
baron
were
chang
the
map
of
europ
everi
fortnight
,
or
when
great
emperor
and
great
king
were
engag
in
a
mad
scrambl
for
coloni
empir
.
we
hope
that
we
are
not
again
at
the
threshold
of
such
an
era
.
but
if
face
it
we
must
,
then
the
unit
state
and
the
rest
of
the
america
can
play
but
one
role
:
through
a
well-ord
neutral
to
do
naught
to
encourag
the
contest
,
through
adequ
defens
to
save
ourselv
from
embroil
and
attack
,
and
through
exampl
and
all
legitim
encourag
and
assist
to
persuad
other
nation
to
return
to
the
way
of
peac
and
good-wil
.
the
evid
befor
us
clearli
prove
that
autocraci
in
world
affair
endang
peac
and
that
such
threat
do
not
spring
from
those
nation
devot
to
the
democrat
ideal
.
if
thi
be
true
in
world
affair
,
it
should
have
the
greatest
weight
in
the
determin
of
domest
polici
.
within

nation
the
chief
concern
of
the
peopl
is
to
prevent
the

that
we
face
made
it
necessari
to
drive
some

from

i
made
that
plain
when
