and
i
would
express
anoth
most
seriou
warn
against
the
poison
effect
of

the
wedg
that
the

wa

in

than
the
wedg
which

between

and

.
everi
littl
rumor
which
is
intend
to
weaken
our
faith
in
our
alli
is
like
an
actual
enemi
agent
in
our
midst-
seek
to
sabotag
our
war
effort
.
there
are
,
here
and
there
,
evil
and
baseless
rumor
against
the
russians-
rumor
against
the
british—rumor
against
our
own
american
command
in
the
field
.
when
you
examin
these
rumor
close
,
you
will
observ
that
everi
one
of
them
bear
the
same
trade-mark—
''
made
in
germani
.
''
we
must
resist
thi
divis
propaganda—w
must
destroy
it
-with
the
same
strength
and
the
same
determin
that
our
fight
men
are
display
as
they
resist
and
destroy
the
panzer
divis
.
in
europ
,
we
shall
resum
the
attack
and—despit
temporari
setback
here
or
there-
we
shall
continu
the
attack
relentlessli
until
germani
is
complet
defeat
.
it
is
appropri
at
thi
time
to
review
the
basic
strategi
which
ha
guid
us
through
three
year
of
war
,
and
which
will
lead
,
eventu
,
to
total
victori
.
the
tremend
effort
of
the
first
year
of
thi
war
wa
direct
toward
the
concentr
of
men
and
suppli
in
the
variou
theater
of
action
at
the
point
where
they
could
hurt
our
enemi
most
.
it
wa
an
effort—in
the
languag
of
the
militari
men—of
deploy
of
our
forc
.
mani
battles—essenti
battles—wer
fought
;
mani
victories—vit
victories—wer
won
.
but
these
battl
and
these
victori
were
fought
and
won
to
hold
back
the
attack
enemi
,
and
to
put
us
in
posit
from
which
we
and
our
alli
could
deliv
the
final
,
decis
blow
.
in
the
begin
our
most
import
militari
task
wa
to
prevent
our
enemies—th
strongest
and
most
violent
aggress
power
that
ever
have
threaten
civilization—from
win
decis
victori
.
but
even
while
we
were
conduct
defens
,
delay
action
,
we
were
look
forward
to
the
time
when
we
could
wrest
the
initi
from
our
enemi
and
place
our
superior
resourc
of
men
and
materi
into
direct
competit
with
them
.
it
wa
plain
then
that
the
defeat
of
either
enemi
would
requir
the
mass
of
overwhelm
forces-
ground
,
sea
,
and
air-
in
posit
from
which
we
and
our
alli
could
strike
directli
against
the
enemi
homeland
and
destroy
the
nazi
and
japanes
war
machin
.
in
the
case
of
japan
,
we
had
to
await
the
complet
of
extens
preliminari
operations—oper
design
to
establish
secur
suppli
line
through
the
japanes
outer-zon
defens
.
thi
call
for
overwhelm
sea
power
and
air
power—support
by
ground
forc
strateg
employ
against
isol
outpost
garrison
.
always—from
the
veri
day
we
were
attacked-
it
wa
right
militarili
as
well
as
moral
to
reject
the
argument
of
those
shortsight
peopl
who
would
have
had
us
throw
britain
and
russia
to
the
nazi
wolv
and
concentr
against
the
japanes
.
such
peopl
urg
that
we
fight
a
pure
defens
war
against
japan
while
allow
the
domin
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
by
nazism
and
fascism
.
in
the
european
theater
the
necessari
base
for
the
mass
of
ground
and
air
power
against
germani
were
alreadi
avail
in
great
britain
.
in
the
mediterranean
area
we
could
begin
ground
oper
against
major
element
of
the
german
armi
as
rapidli
as
we
could
put
troop
in
the
field
,
first
in
north
africa
and
then
in
itali
.
therefor
,
our
decis
wa
made
to
concentr
the
bulk
of
our
ground
and
air
forc
against
germani
until
her
utter
defeat
.
that
decis
wa
base
on
all
these
factor
;
and
it
wa
also
base
on
the
realiz
that
,
of
our
two
enemi
,
germani
would
be
more
abl
to
digest
quickli
her
conquest
,
the
more
abl
quickli
to
convert
the
manpow
and
resourc
of
her
conquer
territori
into
a
war
potenti
.
we
had
in
europ
two
activ
and
indomit
allies-
britain
and
the
soviet
union-
and
there
were
also
the
heroic
resist
movement
in
the
occupi
countri
,
constantli
engag
and
harass
the
german
.
we
can
not
forget
how
britain
held
the
line
,
alon
,
in
1940
and
1941
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
despit
feroci
bombard
from
the
air
,
built
up
a
tremend
armament
industri
which
enabl
her
to
take
the
offens
at
el
alamein
in
1942
.
we
can
not
forget
the
heroic
defens
of
moscow
and
leningrad
and
stalingrad
,
or
the
tremend
russian
offens
of
1943
and
1944
which
destroy
formid
german
armi
.
nor
can
we
forget
how
,
for
more
than
seven
long
year
,
the
chines
peopl
have
been
sustain
the
barbar
attack
of
the
japanes
and
contain
larg
enemi
forc
on
the
vast
area
of
the
asiat
mainland
.
in
the
futur
we
must
never
forget
the
lesson
that
we
have
learned-
that
we
must
have
friend
who
will
work
with
us
in
peac
as
they
have
fought
at
our
side
in
war
.
as
a
result
of
the
combin

of
the

,
great
militari
victori

achiev
in

:
the

the

the

and

;
and
the
begin

island
.
now
,
as
thi
seventy-ninth
congress
meet
,
we
have
reach
the
most
critic
phase
of
the
war
.
the
greatest
victori
of
the
last
year
wa
,
of

,
the

of

seawal
of

and
the
victori
sweep
of
the
alli
forc
through
franc
and
belgium
and
luxembourg—almost
to
the
rhine
itself
.
the
cross-channel
invas
of
the
alli

wa
the
greatest
amphibi
oper
in
the
histori
of
the
world
.
it
overshadow
all
other
oper
in
thi
or
ani
other
war
in
it
immens
.
it
success
is
a
tribut
to
the
fight
courag
of
the
soldier
who
storm
the
beaches-
to
the
sailor
and
merchant
seamen
who
put
the
soldier
ashor
and
kept
them
supplied-and
to
the
militari
and
naval
leader
who
achiev
a
real
miracl
of
plan
and
execut
.
and
it
is
also
a
tribut
to
the
abil
of
two
nation
,
britain
and
america
,
to
plan
togeth
,
and
work
togeth
,
and
fight

in

in

by
a

in
southern

.
in
thi
,
the
same
cooper
and
the
same
harmoni
exist
between
the
american
,
french
,
and
other
alli
forc
base
in
north
africa
and
itali
.
the
success
of
the
two
invas
is
a
tribut
also
to
the
abil
of
mani
men
and
women
to
maintain
silenc
,
when
a
few
careless
word
would
have
imperil
the
live
of
hundr
of
thousand
,
and
would
have
jeopard
the
whole
vast
undertak
.
these
two
great
oper
were
made
possibl
by
success
in
the
battl
of
the
atlant
.
without
thi
success
over
german
submarin
,
we
could
not
have
built
up
our
invas
forc
or
air
forc
in
great
britain
,
nor
could
we
have
kept
a
steadi
stream
of
suppli
flow
to
them
after
they
had

in

.
the

the

the

unfortunately—underr

it
is
import
that
ani

on
that

be
corrected—now
.
what
the

in

are

is
a
well-consid
part
in
our
strategi
in

,
now
aim
at
onli
one
object
—the
total

of

these

are
continu

the

to

the

the

had
our

been
abl
to
come
to

we
had
brush
against

in
the
first
battl
of
the
philippin

in

1944

but
not

thi
recommend

i
now
again
call
upon

to
enact
thi
measur
for
the
total
mobil
of
all
our
human
resourc
for
the
prosecut
of
the

.
i
urg
that
thi
be
done
at

earliest
possibl
moment
.
it
is
not

late
in

in

the
closer
we
come

the
more

the
need

with
which
to
deliv
the
final
blow
to

there
are
three
basic
argument
for
a

:
first
,
it
would
assur
that
we
have
the
right
number
of
worker
in
the
right

at
the
right

.
second
,
it
would
provid
suprem
proof
to
all

that
we
are
give
them
what
they
are
entitl
to
,
which
is
noth
less
than
our
total

.
and
,
third
,
it
would
be
the
final
,
unequivoc
answer
to
the
hope
of
the
nazi
and
the
japanes
that
we
may
becom

that

thi

legisl
would
provid
against

.
it
would
not

in

legisl
,
it
is
not

to
discard
the

which
have

thi

the

dure
the

the

,
in

reassert
their

in

variou
refer
were
made
to
``
strife

between
thi

with

implic
,
if

the
direct
assert
,
that
thi
administr
and
the
congress
could
never
work
togeth
harmoni
in

servic
of

it
can
not
be
deni
that
there
have
been
disagr
between
the
legisl

execut
branches—a
there
have
been
disagr
dure
the
past
centuri

a
half

i
think
we
all
realiz
too
that
there
are
some
peopl
in

citi
whose
task
is
in
larg
part
to
stir
up
dissens

and
to
magnifi
normal

disagr
so
that
they
appear
to
be
irreconcil
conflict

but-
i
think
that
the
over-al
record
in
thi
respect
is
eloqu
:
the
govern
of
the
unit
state
of
america—al
branch
of
it-
ha
a
good
record
of
achiev
in
thi
war
.
the
congress
,
the
execut
,
and
the
judiciari
have
work
togeth
for
the
common
good
.
i
myself
want
to
tell
you
,
the
member
of
the
senat
and
of
the
hous
of
repres
,
how
happi
i
am
in
our
relationship
and
friendship
.
i
have
not
yet
had
the
pleasur
of
meet
some
of
the
new
member
in
each
hous

but
i
hope
that
opportun
will
offer
itself
in
the
near
futur
.
we
have
a
great
mani
problem
ahead
of
us
and
we
must
approach
them
with
realism
and
courag
.
thi
new
year
of
1945
can
be
the
greatest
year
of
achiev
in
human
histori
.
nineteen
forty-f
can
see
the
final
end
of
the
nazi-fascist
reign
of
terror
in

nineteen

can
see
the
close
in

japan
.
most
import
of
all—1945
can
and
must
see
the
substanti
begin
of
the

thi
organ
must
be
the
fulfil
of
the
promis
for
which
men
have
fought
and
die
in

it
must
be
the

have
been
made-
of
