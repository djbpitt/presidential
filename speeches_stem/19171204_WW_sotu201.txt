gentlemen
of
the
congress
:
eight
month
have
elaps
sinc
i
last
had
the
honor
of
address
you
.
they
have
been
month
crowd
with
event
of
immens
and
grave
signific
for
us
.
i
shall
not
undertak
to
retail
or
even
to
summar
those
event
.
the
practic
particular
of
the
part
we
have
play
in
them
will
be
laid
befor
you
in
the
report
of
the
execut
depart
.
i
shall
discuss
onli
our
present
outlook
upon
these
vast
affair
,
our
present
duti
,
and
the
immedi
mean
of
accomplish
the
object
we
shall
hold
alway
in
view
.
i
shall
not
go
back
to
debat
the
caus
of
the
war
.
the
intoler
wrong
done
and
plan
against
us
by
the
sinist
master
of
germani
have
long
sinc
becom
too
grossli
obviou
and
odiou
to
everi
true
american
to
need
to
be
rehears
.
but
i
shall
ask
you
to
consid
again
and
with
a
veri
grave
scrutini
our
object
and
the
measur
by
which
we
mean
to
attain
them
;
for
the
purpos
of
discuss
here
in
thi
place
is
action
,
and
our
action
must
move
straight
toward
definit
end
.
our
object
is
,
of
cours
,
to
win
the
war
;
and
we
shall
not
slacken
or
suffer
ourselv
to
be
divert
until
it
is
won
.
but
it
is
worth
while
ask
and
answer
the
question
,
when
shall
we
consid
the
war
won
?
from
one
point
of
view
it
is
not
necessari
to
broach
thi
fundament
matter
.
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
american
peopl
know
what
the
war
is
about
and
what
sort
of
an
outcom
they
will
regard
as
a
realiz
of
their
purpos
in
it
.
as
a
nation
we
are
unit
in
spirit
and
intent
.
i
pay
littl
heed
to
those
who
tell
me
otherwis
.
i
hear
the
voic
of
dissent
;
who
doe
not
?
i
hear
the
critic
and
the
clamor
of
the
noisili
thoughtless
and
troublesom
.
i
also
see
men
here
and
there
fling
themselv
in
impot
disloyalti
against
the
calm
,
indomit
power
of
the
nation
.
i
hear
men
debat
peac
who
understand
neither
it
natur
not
the
way
in
which
we
may
attain
it
with
uplift
eye
and
unbroken
spirit
.
but
i
know
that
none
of
these
speak
for
the
nation
.
they
do
not
touch
the
heart
of
anyth
.
they
may
safe
be
left
to
strut
their
uneasi
hour
and
be
forgotten
.
but
from
anoth
point
of
view
i
believ
that
it
is
necessari
to
say
plainli
what
we
here
at
the
seat
of
action
consid
the
war
to
be
for
and
what
part
we
mean
to
play
in
the
settlement
of
it
search
issu
.
we
are
the
spokesmen
of
the
american
peopl
and
they
have
a
right
to
know
whether
their
purpos
is
our
.
they
desir
peac
by
the
overcom
of
evil
,
by
the
defeat
onc
for
all
of
the
sinist
forc
that
interrupt
peac
and
render
it
imposs
,
and
they
wish
to
know
how
close
our
thought
run
with
their
and
what
action
we
propos
.
they
are
impati
with
those
who
desir
peac
by
ani
sort
of
compromis
--
deepli
and
indignantli
impati
--
but
they
will
be
equal
impati
with
us
if
we
do
not
make
it
plain
to
them
what
our
object
are
and
what
we
are
plan
for
in
seek
to
make
conquest
of
peac
by
arm
.
i
believ
that
i
speak
for
them
when
i
say
two
thing
:
first
,
that
thi
intoler
thing
of
which
the
master
of
germani
have
shown
us
the
ugli
face
,
thi
menac
of
combin
intrigu
and
forc
which
we
now
see
so
clearli
as
the
german
power
,
a
thing
without
conscienc
or
honor
or
capac
for
coven
peac
,
must
be
crush
and
,
if
it
be
not
utterli
brought
to
an
end
,
at
least
shut
out
from
the
friendli
intercours
of
the
nation
;
and
,
second
,
that
when
thi
thing
and
it
power
are
inde
defeat
and
the
time
come
that
we
can
discuss
peac
--
when
the
german
peopl
have
spokesmen
whose
word
we
can
believ
and
when
those
spokesmen
are
readi
in
the
name
of
their
peopl
to
accept
the
common
judgment
of
the
nation
as
to
what
shall
henceforth
be
the
base
of
law
and
of
coven
for
the
life
of
the
world
--
we
shall
be
will
and
glad
to
pay
the
full
price
for
peac
,
and
pay
it
ungrudgingli
.
we
know
what
that
price
will
be
.
it
will
be
full
,
imparti
justic
--
justic
done
at
everi
point
and
to
everi
nation
that
the
final
settlement
must
affect
,
our
enemi
as
well
as
our
friend
.
you
catch
,
with
me
,
the
voic
of
human
that
are
in
the
air
.
they
grow
daili
more
audibl
,
more
articul
,
more
persuas
,
and
they
come
from
the
heart
of
men
everywher
.
they
insist
that
the
war
shall
not
end
in
vindict
action
of
ani
kind
;
that
no
nation
or
peopl
shall
be
rob
or
punish
becaus
the
irrespons
ruler
of
a
singl
countri
have
themselv
done
deep
and
abomin
wrong
.
it
is
thi
thought
that
ha
been
express
in
the
formula
``
no
annex
,
no
contribut
,
no
punit
indemn
.
''
just
becaus
thi
crude
formula
express
the
instinct
judgment
as
to
right
of
plain
men
everywher
it
ha
been
made
dilig
use
of
by
the
master
of
german
intrigu
to
lead
the
peopl
of
russia
astray
,
and
the
peopl
of
everi
other
countri
their
agent
could
reach
,
in
order
that
a
prematur
peac
might
be
brought
about
befor
autocraci
ha
been
taught
it
final
and
convinc
lesson
,
and
the
peopl
of
the
world
put
in
control
of
their
own
destini
.
but
the
fact
that
a
wrong
use
ha
been
made
of
a
just
idea
is
no
reason
whi
a
right
use
should
not
be
made
of
it
.
it
ought
to
be
brought
under
the
patronag
of
it
real
friend
.
let
it
be
said
again
that
autocraci
must
first
be
shown
the
utter
futil
of
it
claim
to
power
or
leadership
in
the
modern
world
.
it
is
imposs
to
appli
ani
standard
of
justic
so
long
as
such
forc
are
uncheck
and
undef
as
the
present
master
of
germani
command
.
not
until
that
ha
been
done
can
right
be
set
up
as
arbit
and
peace-mak
among
the
nation
.
but
when
that
ha
been
done
--
as
,
god
will
,
it
assuredli
will
be
--
we
shall
at
last
be
free
to
do
an
unpreced
thing
,
and
thi
is
the
time
to
avow
our
purpos
to
do
it
.
we
shall
be
free
to
base
peac
on
generos
and
justic
,
to
the
exclus
of
all
selfish
claim
to
advantag
even
on
the
part
of
the
victor
.
let
there
be
no
misunderstand
.
our
present
and
immedi
task
is
to
win
the
war
,
and
noth
shall
turn
us
asid
from
it
until
it
is
accomplish
.
everi
power
and
resourc
we
possess
,
whether
of
men
,
of
money
,
or
of
materi
,
is
be
devot
and
will
continu
to
be
devot
to
that
purpos
until
it
is
achiev
.
those
who
desir
to
bring
peac
about
befor
that
purpos
is
achiev
i
counsel
to
carri
their
advic
elsewher
.
we
will
not
entertain
it
.
we
shall
regard
the
war
as
won
onli
when
the
german
peopl
say
to
us
,
through
properli
accredit
repres
,
that
they
are
readi
to
agre
to
a
settlement
base
upon
justic
and
the
repar
of
the
wrong
their
ruler
have
done
.
they
have
done
a
wrong
to
belgium
which
must
be
repair
.
they
have
establish
a
power
over
other
land
and
peopl
than
their
own
--
over
the
great
empir
of
austria-hungari
,
over
hitherto
free
balkan
state
,
over
turkey
,
and
within
asia
--
which
must
be
relinquish
.
germani
's
success
by
skill
,
by
industri
,
by
knowledg
,
by
enterpris
we
did
not
grudg
or
oppos
,
but
admir
,
rather
.
she
had
built
up
for
herself
a
real
empir
of
trade
and
influenc
,
secur
by
the
peac
of
the
world
.
we
were
content
to
abid
the
rivalri
of
manufactur
,
scienc
,
and
commerc
that
were
involv
for
us
in
her
success
and
stand
or
fall
as
we
had
or
did
not
have
the
brain
and
the
initi
to
surpass
her
.
but
at
the
moment
when
she
had
conspicu
won
her
triumph
of
peac
she
threw
them
away
,
to
establish
in
their
stead
what
the
world
will
no
longer
permit
to
be
establish
,
militari
and
polit
domin
by
arm
,
by
which
to
oust
where
she
could
not
excel
the
rival
she
most
fear
and
hate
.
the
peac
we
make
must
remedi
that
wrong
.
it
must
deliv
the
onc
fair
land
and
happi
peopl
of
belgium
and
northern
franc
from
the
prussian
conquest
and
the
prussian
menac
,
but
it
must
also
deliv
the
peopl
of
austria-hungari
,
the
peopl
of
the
balkan
,
and
the
peopl
of
turkey
,
alik
in
europ
and
in
asia
,
from
the
impud
and
alien
dominion
of
the
prussian
militari
and
commerci
autocraci
.
we
owe
it
,
howev
,
to
ourselv
to
say
that
we
do
not
wish
in
ani
way
to
impair
or
to
rearrang
the
austro-hungarian
empir
.
it
is
no
affair
of
our
what
they
do
with
their
own
life
,
either
industri
or
polit
.
we
do
not
purpos
or
desir
to
dictat
to
them
in
ani
way
.
we
onli
desir
to
see
that
their
affair
are
left
in
their
own
hand
,
in
all
matter
,
great
or
small
.
we
shall
hope
to
secur
for
the
peopl
of
the
balkan
peninsula
and
for
the
peopl
of
the
turkish
empir
the
right
and
opportun
to
make
their
own
live
safe
,
their
own
fortun
secur
against
oppress
or
injustic
and
from
the
dictat
of
foreign
court
or
parti
.
and
our
attitud
and
purpos
with
regard
to
germani
herself
are
of
a
like
kind
.
we
intend
no
wrong
against
the
german
empir
,
no
interfer
with
her
intern
affair
.
we
should
deem
either
the
one
or
the
other
absolut
unjustifi
,
absolut
contrari
to
the
principl
we
have
profess
to
live
by
and
to
hold
most
sacr
throughout
our
life
as
a
nation
.
the
peopl
of
germani
are
be
told
by
the
men
whom
they
now
permit
to
deceiv
them
and
to
act
as
their
master
that
they
are
fight
for
the
veri
life
and
exist
of
their
empir
,
a
war
of
desper
self-defens
against
deliber
aggress
.
noth
could
be
more
grossli
or
wantonli
fals
,
and
we
must
seek
by
the
utmost
open
and
candor
as
to
our
real
aim
to
convinc
them
of
it
fals
.
we
are
in
fact
fight
for
their
emancip
from
fear
,
along
with
our
own
--
from
the
fear
as
well
as
from
the
fact
of
unjust
attack
by
neighbor
or
rival
or
schemer
after
world
empir
.
no
one
is
threaten
the
exist
or
the
independ
or
the
peac
enterpris
of
the
german
empir
.
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
the
detriment
of
the
german
peopl
is
thi
,
that
if
they
should
still
,
after
the
war
is
over
,
continu
to
be
oblig
to
live
under
ambiti
and
intrigu
master
interest
to
disturb
the
peac
of
the
world
,
men
or
class
of
men
whom
the
other
peopl
of
the
world
could
not
trust
,
it
might
be
imposs
to
admit
them
to
the
partnership
of
nation
which
must
henceforth
guarante
the
world
's
peac
.
that
partnership
must
be
a
partnership
of
peopl
,
not
a
mere
partnership
of
govern
.
it
might
be
imposs
,
also
,
in
such
untoward
circumst
,
to
admit
germani
to
the
free
econom
intercours
which
must
inevit
spring
out
of
the
other
partnership
of
a
real
peac
.
but
there
would
be
no
aggress
in
that
;
and
such
a
situat
,
inevit
becaus
of
distrust
,
would
in
the
veri
natur
of
thing
sooner
or
later
cure
itself
,
by
process
which
would
assuredli
set
in

the

the
veri

commit
in
thi

have
to
be

that
of

but
they
can
not
and
must
not
be
right
by
the
commiss

her
alli
.
the
world
will
not
permit
the
commiss
of
similar
wrong
as
a
mean
of
repar
and
settlement
.
statesmen
must
by
thi
time
have
learn
that
the
opinion
of
the
world
is
everywher
wide
awak
and
fulli
comprehend
the
issu
involv
.
no
repres
of

will
dare
disregard
it
by
attempt
ani
such
coven
of
selfish
and
compromis
as
were
enter
into
at
the
congress
of
vienna
.
the
thought
of
the
plain
peopl
here
and
everywher
throughout
the
world
,
the
peopl
who
enjoy
no
privileg
and
have
veri
simpl
and
unsophist
standard
of
right
and
wrong
,
is
the
air
all
govern
must
henceforth
breath
if
they
would
live
.
it
is
in
the
full
disclos
light
of
that
thought
that
all
polici
must
be
conceiv
and
execut
in
thi
midday
hour
of
the
world
's
life
.
german
ruler
have
been
abl
to
upset
the
peac
of
the
world
onli
becaus
the
german
peopl
were
not
suffer
under
their
tutelag
to
share
the
comradeship
of
the
other
peopl
of
the
world
either
in
thought
or
in
purpos
.
they
were
allow
to
have
no
opinion
of
their
own
which
might
be
set
up
as
a
rule
of
conduct
for
those
who
exercis
author
over
them
.
but
the
congress
that
conclud
thi
war
will
feel
the
full
strength
of
the
tide
that
run
now
in
the
heart
and
conscienc
of
free
men
everywher
.
it
conclus
will
run
with
those
tide
.
all
these
thing
have
been
true
from
the
veri
begin
of
thi
stupend
war
;
and
i
can
not
help
think
that
if
they
had
been
made
plain
at
the
veri
outset
the
sympathi
and
enthusiasm
of
the
russian
peopl
might
have
been
onc
for
all
enlist
on
the
side
of
the
alli
,
suspicion
and
distrust
swept
away
,
and
a
real
and
last
union
of
purpos
effect
.
had
they
believ
these
thing
at
the
veri
moment
of
their
revolut
and
had
they
been
confirm
in
that
belief
sinc
,
the
sad
revers
which
have
recent
mark
the
progress
of
their
affair
toward
an
order
and
stabl
govern
of
free
men
might
have
been
avoid
.
the
russian
peopl
have
been
poison
by
the
veri
same
falsehood
that
have
kept
the
german
peopl
in
the
dark
,
and
the
poison
ha
been
administ
by
the
veri
same
hand
.
the
onli
possibl
antidot
is
the
truth
.
it
can
not
be
utter
too
plainli
or
too
often
.
from
everi
point
of
view
,
therefor
,
it
ha
seem
to
be
my
duti
to
speak
these
declar
of
purpos
,
to
add
these
specif
interpret
to
what
i
took
the
liberti
of
say
to
the
senat
in
januari
.
our
entranc
into
the
war
ha
not
alter
our
attitud
toward
the
settlement
that
must
come
when
it
is
over
.
when
i
said
in
januari
that
the

i

think

i

not
of

need

also
of
the
great

power
nation

and
of
our
present
enemi
as
well
as
our
present
associ
in
the
war
.
i
wa
think
,
and
am
think
now
,
of
austria
herself
,
among
the
rest
,
as
well
as
of
serbia
and
of
poland
.
justic
and
equal
of
right
can
be
had
onli
at
a
great
price
.
we
are
seek
perman
,
not
temporari
,
foundat
for
the
peac
of
the
world
and
must
seek
them
candidli
and
fearlessli
.
as
alway
,
the
right
will
prove
to
be
the
expedi
.
what
shall
we
do
,
then
,
to
push
thi
great
war
of
freedom
and
justic
to
it
righteou
conclus
?
we
must
clear
away
with
a
thorough
hand
all
impedi
to
success
and
we
must
make
everi
adjust
of
law
that
will
facilit
the
full
and
free
use
of
our
whole
capac
and
forc
as
a
fight
unit
.
one
veri
embarrass
obstacl
that
stand
in
our
way
is
that
we
are
at
war
with
germani
but
not
with
her
alli
.
i
therefor
veri
earnestli
recommend
that
the
congress
immedi
declar
the
unit
state
in
a
state
of
war
with
austria-hungari
.
doe
it
seem
strang
to
you
that
thi
should
be
the
conclus
of
the
argument
i
have
just
address
to
you
?
it
is
not
.
it
is
in
fact
the
inevit
logic
of
what
i
have
said
.
austria-hungari
is
for
the
time
be
not
her
own
mistress
but
simpli
the
vassal
of
the
german
govern
.
we
must
face
the
fact
as
they
are
and
act
upon
them
without
sentiment
in
thi
stern
busi
.
the
govern
of
austria-hungari
is
not
act
upon
it
own
initi
or
in
respons
to
the
wish
and
feel
of
it
own
peopl
but
as
the
instrument
of
anoth
nation
.
we
must
meet
it
forc
with
our
own
and
regard
the
central
power
as
but
one
.
the
war
can
be
success
conduct
in
no
other
way
.
the
same
logic
would
lead
also
to
a
declar
of
war
against
turkey
and
bulgaria
.
they
also
are
the
tool
of
germani
.
but
they
are
mere
tool
and
do
not
yet
stand
in
the
direct
path
of
our
necessari
action
.
we
shall
go
wherev
the
necess
of
thi
war
carri
us
,
but
it
seem
to
me
that
we
should
go
onli
where
immedi
and
practic
consider
lead
us
and
not
heed
ani
other
.
the
financi
and
militari
measur
which
must
be
adopt
will
suggest
themselv
as
the
war
and
it
undertak
develop
,
but
i
will
take
the
liberti
of
propos
to
you
certain
other
act
of
legisl
which
seem
to
me
to
be
need
for
the
support
of
the
war
and
for
the
releas
of
our
whole
forc
and
energi
.
it
will
be
necessari
to
extend
in
certain
particular
the
legisl
of
the
last
session
with
regard
to
alien
enemi
;
and
also
necessari
,
i
believ
,
to
creat
a
veri
definit
and
particular
control
over
the
entranc
and
departur
of
all
person
into
and
from
the
unit
state
.
legisl
should
be
enact
defin
as
a
crimin

4067
of

and
women
as
well
as
men
should
be
includ
under
the
term
of
the

it
is
like
that
as
time
goe
on

alien
enemi
will
be
will
to
be
fed
and
hous
at
the
expens
of
the
govern
in
the
detent
camp
and
it
would
be
the
purpos
of
the
legisl
i
have
suggest
to
confin
offend
among
them
in
penitentiari
and
other
similar
institut
where
they
could
be
made
to

as
other

recent
experi
ha
convinc
me
that
the
congress
must
go
further
in
author
the
govern
to
set
limit
to
price
.
the
law
of
suppli

demand
,
i
am
sorri
to
say
,
ha
been
replac
by
the
law
of
unrestrain

the

while

and
similar

it
is
imper
necessari
that

also
the

the

and
i
beg
that
the

permit

to
express

that
it
will
be

to
that

call

your

what
i
am
perfectli
clear
about
is
that
in

our

should
be

the
vigor

prosecut
of
the
great

of

.
we
can
do
thi
with
all
the
greater
zeal
and
enthusiasm
becaus
we
know
that
for
us
thi
is
a
war
of
high
principl
,
debas
by
no
selfish
ambit
of
conquest

spoliat

becaus
we
know
,
and
all

know
,
that
we
have
been
forc
into
it
to
save
the
veri
institut
we
live

from

the

sought

our

they

it

becaus
it
is
for

a

in

all
