each
moment
in

is
a
fleet
time
,
preciou
and
uniqu
.
but
some
stand
out
as
moment
of
begin
,
in
which
cours
are
set
that
shape
decad
or
centuri
.
thi
can
be
such
a
moment
.
forc
now
are
converg
that
make
possibl
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
hope
that
mani
of

the
spiral

of

to
contempl

within

,
advanc
that
onc
would
have
taken

.
in
throw
wide
the
horizon
of
space
,
we
have
discov
new
horizon
on
earth
.
for
the
first
time
,
becaus
the
peopl
of
the
world
want
peac
,
and
the
leader
of
the
world
are
afraid
of
war
,
the
time
are
on
the
side
of
peac
.
eight
year
from
now
america
will
celebr
it
200th
anniversari
as
a
nation
.
within
the
lifetim
of
most
peopl
now
live
,
mankind
will
celebr
that
great
new
year
which
come
onli
onc
in
a
thousand
year
--
the
begin
of
the
third
millennium
.
what
kind
of
nation
we
will
be
,
what
kind
of
world
we
will
live
in
,
whether
we
shape
the
futur
in
the
imag
of
our
hope
,
is
our
to
determin
by
our
action
and
our
choic
.
the
greatest
honor
histori
can
bestow
is
the
titl
of
peacemak
.
thi
honor
now
beckon
america
--
the
chanc
to
help
lead
the
world
at
last
out
of
the
valley
of
turmoil
,
and
onto
that
high
ground
of
peac
that
man
ha
dream
of
sinc
the
dawn
of
civil
.
if
we
succeed
,
gener
to
come
will
say
of
us
now
live
that
we
master
our
moment
,
that
we
help
make
the
world
safe
for
mankind
.
thi
is
our
summon
to
great
.
i
believ
the
american
peopl
are
readi
to
answer
thi
call
.
the
second
third
of
thi
centuri
ha
been
a
time
of
proud
achiev
.
we
have
made
enorm
stride
in
scienc
and
industri
and
agricultur
.
we
have
share
our
wealth
more
broadli
than
ever
.
we
have
learn
at
last
to
manag
a
modern
economi
to
assur
it
continu
growth
.
we
have
given
freedom
new
reach
,
and
we
have
begun
to
make
it
promis
real
for
black
as
well
as
for
white
.
we
see
the
hope
of
tomorrow
in
the
youth
of
today
.
i
know
america
's
youth
.
i
believ
in
them
.
we
can
be
proud
that
they
are
better
educ
,
more
commit
,
more
passion
driven
by
conscienc
than
ani
gener
in
our
histori
.
no
peopl
ha
ever
been
so
close
to
the
achiev
of
a
just
and
abund
societi
,
or
so
possess
of
the
will
to
achiev
it
.
becaus
our
strength
are
so
great
,
we
can
afford
to
apprais
our
weak
with
candor
and
to
approach
them
with
hope
.
stand
in
thi
same
place
a
third
of
a
centuri
ago
,
franklin
delano
roosevelt
address
a
nation
ravag
by
depress
and
grip
in
fear
.
he
could
say
in
survey
the
nation
's
troubl
:
``
they
concern
,
thank
god
,
onli
materi
thing
.
''
our
crisi
today
is
the
revers
.
we
have
found
ourselv
rich
in
good
,
but
rag
in
spirit
;
reach
with
magnific
precis
for
the
moon
,
but
fall
into
raucou
discord
on
earth
.
we
are
caught
in
war
,
want
peac
.
we
are
torn
by
divis
,
want
uniti
.
we
see
around
us
empti
live
,
want
fulfil
.
we
see
task
that
need
do
,
wait
for
hand
to
do
them
.
to
a
crisi
of
the
spirit
,
we
need
an
answer
of
the
spirit
.
to
find
that
answer
,
we
need
onli
look
within
ourselv
.
when
we
listen
to
``
the
better
angel
of
our
natur
,
''
we
find
that
they
celebr
the
simpl
thing
,
the
basic
thing
--
such
as
good
,
decenc
,
love
,
kind
.
great
come
in
simpl
trap
.
the
simpl
thing
are
the
one
most
need
today
if
we
are
to
surmount
what
divid
us
,
and
cement
what
unit
us
.
to
lower
our
voic
would
be
a
simpl
thing
.
in
these
difficult
year
,
america
ha
suffer
from
a
fever
of
word
;
from
inflat
rhetor
that
promis
more
than
it
can
deliv
;
from
angri
rhetor
that
fan
discont
into
hatr
;
from
bombast
rhetor
that
postur
instead
of
persuad
.
we
can
not
learn
from
one
anoth
until
we
stop
shout
at
one
anoth
--
until
we
speak
quietli
enough
so
that
our
word
can
be
heard
as
well
as
our
voic
.
for
it
part
,
govern
will
listen
.
we
will
strive
to
listen
in
new
way
--
to
the
voic
of
quiet
anguish
,
the
voic
that
speak
without
word
,
the
voic
of
the
heart
--
to
the
injur
voic
,
the
anxiou
voic
,
the
voic
that
have
despair
of
be
heard
.
those
who
have
been
left
out
,
we
will
tri
to
bring
in
.
those
left
behind
,
we
will
help
to
catch
up
.
for
all
of
our
peopl
,
we
will
set
as
our
goal
the
decent
order
that
make
progress
possibl
and
our
live
secur
.
as
we
reach
toward
our
hope
,
our
task
is
to
build
on
what
ha
gone
befor
--
not
turn
away
from
the
old
,
but
turn
toward
the
new
.
in
thi
past
third
of
a
centuri
,
govern
ha
pass
more
law
,
spent
more
money
,
initi
more
program
,
than
in
all
our
previou
histori
.
in
pursu
our
goal
of
full
employ
,
better
hous
,
excel
in
educ
;
in
rebuild
our
citi
and
improv
our
rural
area
;
in
protect
our
environ
and
enhanc
the
qualiti
of
life
--
in
all
these
and
more
,
we
will
and
must
press
urgent
forward
.
we
shall
plan
now
for
the
day
when
our
wealth
can
be
transfer
from
the
destruct
of
war
abroad
to
the
urgent
need
of
our
peopl
at
home
.
the
american
dream
doe
not
come
to
those
who
fall
asleep
.
but
we
are
approach
the
limit
of
what
govern
alon
can
do
.
our
greatest
need
now
is
to
reach
beyond
govern
,
and
to
enlist
the
legion
of
the
concern
and
the
commit
.
what
ha
to
be
done
,
ha
to
be
done
by
govern
and
peopl
togeth
or
it
will
not
be
done
at
all
.
the
lesson
of
past
agoni
is
that
without
the
peopl
we
can
do
noth
;
with
the
peopl
we
can
do
everyth
.
to
match
the
magnitud
of
our
task
,
we
need
the
energi
of
our
peopl
--
enlist
not
onli
in
grand
enterpris
,
but
more
importantli
in
those
small
,
splendid
effort
that
make
headlin
in
the
neighborhood
newspap
instead
of
the
nation
journal
.
with
these
,
we
can
build
a
great
cathedr
of
the
spirit
--
each
of
us
rais
it
one
stone
at
a
time
,
as
he
reach
out
to
hi
neighbor
,
help
,
care
,
do
.
i
do
not
offer
a
life
of
uninspir
eas
.
i
do
not
call
for
a
life
of
grim
sacrific
.
i
ask
you
to
join
in
a
high
adventur
--
one
as
rich
as
human
itself
,
and
as
excit
as
the
time
we
live
in
.
the
essenc
of
freedom
is
that
each
of
us
share
in
the
shape
of
hi
own
destini
.
until
he
ha
been
part
of
a
caus
larger
than
himself
,
no
man
is
truli
whole
.
the
way
to
fulfil
is
in
the
use
of
our
talent
;
we
achiev
nobil
in
the
spirit
that
inspir
that
use
.
as
we
measur
what
can
be
done
,
we
shall
promis
onli
what
we
know
we
can
produc
,
but
as
we
chart
our
goal
we
shall
be
lift
by
our
dream
.
no
man
can
be
fulli
free
while
hi
neighbor
is
not
.
to
go
forward
at
all
is
to
go
forward
togeth
.
thi
mean
black
and
white
togeth
,
as
one
nation
,
not
two
.
the
law
have
caught
up
with
our
conscienc
.
what
remain
is
to
give
life
to
what
is
in
the
law
:
to
ensur
at
last
that
as
all
are
born
equal
in
digniti
befor
god
,
all
are
born
equal
in
digniti
befor
man
.
as
we
learn
to
go
forward
togeth
at
home
,
let
us
also
seek
to
go
forward
togeth
with
all
mankind
.
let
us
take
as
our
goal
:
where
peac
is
unknown
,
make
it
welcom
;
where
peac
is
fragil
,
make
it
strong
;
where
peac
is
temporari
,
make
it
perman
.
after
a
period
of
confront
,
we
are
enter
an
era
of
negoti
.
let
all
nation
know
that
dure
thi
administr
our
line
of
commun
will
be
open
.
we
seek
an
open
world
--
open
to
idea
,
open
to
the
exchang
of
good
and
peopl
--
a
world
in
which
no
peopl
,
great
or
small
,
will
live
in
angri
isol
.
we
can
not
expect
to
make
everyon
our
friend
,
but
we
can
tri
to
make
no
one
our
enemi
.
those
who
would
be
our
adversari
,
we
invit
to
a
peac
competit
--
not
in
conquer
territori
or
extend
dominion
,
but
in
enrich
the
life
of
man
.
as
we
explor
the
reach
of
space
,
let
us
go
to
the
new
world
togeth
--
not
as
new
world
to
be
conquer
,
but
as
a
new
adventur
to
be
share
.
with
those
who
are
will
to
join
,
let
us
cooper
to
reduc
the
burden
of
arm
,
to
strengthen
the
structur
of
peac
,
to
lift
up
the
poor
and
the
hungri
.
but
to
all
those
who
would
be
tempt
by
weak
,
let
us
leav
no
doubt
that
we
will
be
as
strong
as
we
need
to
be
for
as
long
as
we
need
to
be
.
over
the
past
twenti
year
,
sinc
i
first
came
to
thi
capit
as
a
freshman
congressman
,
i
have
visit
most
of
the
nation
of
the
world
.
i
have
come
to
know
the
leader
of
the
world
,
and
the
great
forc
,
the
hatr
,
the
fear
that
divid
the
world
.
i
know
that
peac
doe
not
come
through
wish
for
it
--
that
there
is
no
substitut
for
day
and
even
year
of
patient
and
prolong
diplomaci
.
i
also
know
the
peopl
of
the
world
.
i
have
seen
the
hunger
of
a
homeless
child
,
the
pain
of
a
man
wound
in
battl
,
the
grief
of
a
mother
who
ha
lost
her
son
.
i
know
these
have
no
ideolog
,
no
race
.
i
know
america
.
i
know
the
heart
of
america
is
good
.
i
speak
from
my
own
heart
,
and
the
heart
of
my
countri
,
the
deep
concern
we
have
for
those
who
suffer
,
and
those
who
sorrow
.
i
have
taken
an
oath
today
in
the
presenc
of
god
and
my
countrymen
to
uphold
and
defend
the
constitut
of
the
unit
state
.
to
that
oath
i
now
add
thi
sacr
commit
:
i
shall
consecr
my
offic
,
my
energi
,
and
all
the
wisdom
i
can
summon
,
to
the
caus
of
peac
among
nation
.
let
thi
messag
be
heard
by
strong
and
weak
alik
:
the
peac
we
seek
to
win
is
not
victori
over
ani
other
peopl
,
but
the
peac
that
come
``
with
heal
in
it
wing
''
;
with
compass
for
those
who
have
suffer
;
with
understand
for
those
who
have
oppos
us
;
with
the
opportun
for
all
the
peopl
of
thi
earth
to
choos
their
own
destini
.
onli
a
few
short
week
ago
,
we
share
the
glori
of
man
's
first
sight
of
the
world
as
god
see
it
,
as
a
singl
sphere
reflect
light
in
the
dark
.
as
the
apollo
astronaut
flew
over
the
moon
's
gray
surfac
on
christma
eve
,
they
spoke
to
us
of
the
beauti
of
earth
--
and
in
that
voic
so
clear
across
the
lunar
distanc
,
we
heard
them
invok
god
's
bless
on
it
good
.
in
that
moment
,
their
view
from
the
moon
move
poet
archibald
macleish
to
write
:
``
to
see
the
earth
as
it
truli
is
,
small
and
blue
and
beauti
in
that
etern
silenc
where
it
float
,
is
to
see
ourselv
as
rider
on
the
earth
togeth
,
brother
on
that
bright
loveli
in
the
etern
cold
--
brother
who
know
now
they
are
truli
brother
.
''
in
that
moment
of
surpass
technolog
triumph
,
men
turn
their
thought
toward
home
and
human
--
see
in
that
far
perspect
that
man
's
destini
on
earth
is
not
divis
;
tell
us
that
howev
far
we
reach
into
the
cosmo
,
our
destini
lie
not
in
the
star
but
on
earth
itself
,
in
our
own
hand
,
in
our
own
heart
.
we
have
endur
a
long
night
of
the
american
spirit
.
but
as
our
eye
catch
the
dim
of
the
first
ray
of
dawn
,
let
us
not
curs
the
remain
dark
.
let
us
gather
the
light
.
our
destini
offer
,
not
the
cup
of
despair
,
but
the
chalic
of
opportun
.
so
let
us
seiz
it
,
not
in
fear
,
but
in
glad
--
and
,
``
rider
on
the
earth
togeth
,
''
let
us
go
forward
,
firm
in
our
faith
,
steadfast
in
our
purpos
,
cautiou
of
the
danger
;
but
sustain
by
our
confid
in
the
will
of
god
and
the
promis
of
man
.
