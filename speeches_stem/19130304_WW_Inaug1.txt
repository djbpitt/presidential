there
ha
been
a
chang

what
doe
the
chang

?
that
is
the
question
that
is
uppermostin
our
mind
to-day
.
that
is
the

,
if
i
may
,
to
interpret
the
occas
.
it
mean
much
more
than
the
mere
success
of
a

.
the
success
ofa
parti
mean
littl
except
when
the
nation
is
use
that
parti
for
a
largeand
definit
purpos
.
no
one
can
mistak
the
purpos
for
which
the
nationnow
seek
to
use
the

it
seek
to
use

some
old

had
grown
familiar

and
which
had
begun
to
creep
into
the
veri

our

we

mani
deep

great

often
been
made
use

those

had

at

a
vision
ha
been
vouchsaf
us
of

there
ha
been
someth
crude

heartless
and
unfeel
in
our
hasteto
succeed

our
thought
ha
been
``

everi

look

we
rear

we
hadnot
forgotten
our
moral
.
we
rememb
well
enough
that
we
had
set
upa
polici
which
wa
meant
to
serv
the
humblest
as
well
as
the
most
power
,
with
an
eye
singl
to
the
standard
of
justic
and
fair
play
,
and
rememberedit
with
pride
.
but
we
were
veri
heedless
and
in
a
hurri
to
be
great
.
we
have
come
now
to
the
sober
second
thought
.
the
scale
of
heedlessnesshav
fallen
from
our
eye

we
have
made
up
our

to
squar
