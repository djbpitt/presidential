gentlemen
of
the
congress
:
when
i
address
myself
to
perform
the
duti
laid
upon
the
presid
by
the
constitut
to
present
to
you
an
annual
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
,
i
found
my
thought
domin
by
an
immort
sentenc
of
abraham
lincoln's-
''
let
us
have
faith
that
right
make
might
,
and
in
that
faith
let
us
dare
to
do
our
duti
as
we
understand
it
''
-a
sentenc
immort
becaus
it
embodi
in
a
form
of
utter
simplic
and
puriti
the
essenti
faith
of
the
nation
,
the
faith
in
which
it
wa
conceiv
,
and
the
faith
in
which
it
ha
grown
to
glori
and
power
.
with
that
faith
and
the
birth
of
a
nation
found
upon
it
came
the
hope
into
the
world
that
a
new
order
would
prevail
throughout
the
affair
of
mankind
,
an
order
in
which
reason
and
right
would
take
preced
over
covet
and
forc
;
and
i
believ
that
i
express
the
wish
and
purpos
of
everi
thought
american
when
i
say
that
thi
sentenc
mark
for
us
in
the
plainest
manner
the
part
we
should
play
alik
in
the
arrang
of
our
domest
affair
and
in
our
exercis
of
influenc
upon
the
affair
of
the
world
.
by
thi
faith
,
and
by
thi
faith
alon
,
can
the
world
be
lift
out
of
it
present
confus
and
despair
.
it
wa
thi
faith
which
prevail
over
the
wick
forc
of
germani
.
you
will
rememb
that
the
begin
of
the
end
of
the
war
came
when
the
german
peopl
found
themselv
face
to
face
with
the
conscienc
of
the
world
and
realiz
that
right
wa
everywher
array
against
the
wrong
that
their
govern
wa
attempt
to
perpetr
.
i
think
,
therefor
,
that
it
is
true
to
say
that
thi
wa
the
faith
which
won
the
war
.
certainli
thi
is
the
faith
with
which
our
gallant
men
went
into
the
field
and
out
upon
the
sea
to
make
sure
of
victori
.
thi
is
the
mission
upon
which
democraci
came
into
the
world
.
democraci
is
an
assert
of
the
right
of
the
individu
to
live
and
to
be
treat
justli
as
against
ani
attempt
on
the
part
of
ani
combin
of
individu
to
make
law
which
will
overburden
him
or
which
will
destroy
hi
equal
among
hi
fellow
in
the
matter
of
right
or
privileg
;
and
i
think
we
all
realiz
that
the
day
ha
come
when
democraci
is
be
put
upon
it
final
test
.
the
old
world
is
just
now
suffer
from
a
wanton
reject
of
the
principl
of
democraci
and
a
substitut
of
the
principl
of
autocraci
as
assert
in
the
name
,
but
without
the
author
and
sanction
,
of
the
multitud
.
thi
is
the
time
of
all
other
when
democraci
should
prove
it
puriti
and
it
spiritu
power
to
prevail
.
it
is
sure
the
manifest
destini
of
the
unit
state
to
lead
in
the
attempt
to
make
thi
spirit
prevail
.
there
are
two
way
in
which
the
unit
state
can
assist
to
accomplish
thi
great
object
.
first
,
by
offer
the
exampl
within
her
own
border
of
the
will
and
power
of
democraci
to
make
and
enforc
law
which
are
unquestion
just
and
which
are
equal
in
their
administration-law
which
secur
it
full
right
to
labor
and
yet
at
the
same
time
safeguard
the
integr
of
properti
,
and
particularli
of
that
properti
which
is
devot
to
the
develop
of
industri
and
the
increas
of
the
necessari
wealth
of
the
world
.
second
,
by
stand
for
right
and
justic
as
toward
individu
nation
.
the
law
of
democraci
is
for
the
protect
of
the
weak
,
and
the
influenc
of
everi
democraci
in
the
world
should
be
for
the
protect
of
the
weak
nation
,
the
nation
which
is
struggl
toward
it
right
and
toward
it
proper
recognit
and
privileg
in
the
famili
of
nation
.
the
unit
state
can
not
refus
thi
role
of
champion
without
put
the
stigma
of
reject
upon
the
great
and
devot
men
who
brought
it
govern
into
exist
and
establish
it
in
the
face
of
almost
univers
opposit
and
intrigu
,
even
in
the
face
of
wanton
forc
,
as
,
for
exampl
,
against
the
order
in
council
of
great
britain
and
the
arbitrari
napoleon
decre
which
involv
us
in
what
we
know
as
the
war
of
1812
.
i
urg
you
to
consid
that
the
display
of
an
immedi
disposit
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
remedi
ani
injustic
or
evil
that
may
have
shown
themselv
in
our
own
nation
life
will
afford
the
most
effectu
offset
to
the
forc
of
chao
and
tyranni
which
are
play
so
disastr
a
part
in
the
fortun
of
the
free
peopl
of
more
than
one
part
of
the
world
.
the
unit
state
is
of
necess
the
sampl
democraci
of
the
world
,
and
the
triumph
of
democraci
depend
upon
it
success
.
recoveri
from
the
disturb
and
sometim
disastr
effect
of
the
late
war
ha
been
exceedingli
slow
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
,
and
ha
given
promis
,
i
venture-to
say
,
of
earli
complet
onli
in
our
own
fortun
countri
;
but
even
with
us
the
recoveri
halt
and
is
imped
at
time
,
and
there
are
immedi
servic
act
of
legisl
which
it
seem
to
me
we
ought
to
attempt
,
to
assist
that
recoveri
and
prove
the
indestruct
recup
forc
of
a
great
govern
of
the
peopl
.
one
of
these
is
to
prove
that
a
great
democraci
can
keep
hous
as
success
and
in
as
business-lik
a
fashion
as
ani
other
govern
.
it
seem
to
me
that
the
first
step
toward
provid
thi
is
to
suppli
ourselv
with
a
systemat
method
of
handl
our
estim
and
expenditur
and
bring
them
to
the
point
where
they
will
not
be
an
unnecessari
strain
upon
our
incom
or
necessit
unreason
taxat
;
in
other
word
,
a
workabl
budget
system
.
and
i
respect
suggest
that
two
element
are
essenti
to
such
a
system-nam
,
not
onli
that
the
propos
of
appropri

be
in
the
hand
of
a
singl
bodi
,
such
as
a
singl
appropri
committe
in
each
hous
of
the
congress
,
but
also
that
thi
bodi
should
be
brought
into
such
cooper
with
the
depart
of
the
govern
and
with
the
treasuri
of
the
unit
state
as
would
enabl
it
to
act
upon
a
complet
conspectu
of
the
need
of
the
govern
and
the
resourc
from
which
it
must
draw
it
incom

i

therefor

that

of

to

be
to

respons
to
what
i
believ
to
be
the
impuls
of
sympathi

i
earnestli
suggest
that
the
congress
author
the
treasuri
of
the
unit
state
to
make
to
the
struggl
govern
of
armenia
such
a
loan
as
wa
made
to
sever
of
the
alli
govern
dure
the
war
,
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
would
be
desir
to
provid
in
the
legisl
itself
that
the
expenditur
of
the
money
thu
loan
should
be
under
the
supervis
of
a
commiss
,
or
at
least
a
commission
,
from
the
unit
state
in
order
that
revolutionari
tendenc
within
armenia
itself
might
not
be
afford
by
the
loan
a
further
tempt
opportun
.
allow
me
to
call
your
attent
to
the
fact
that
the
peopl
of
the
philippin
island
have
succeed
in
maintain
a
stabl
govern
sinc
the
last
action
of
the
congress
in
their
behalf
,
and
have
thu
fulfil
the
condit
set
by
the
congress
as
preced
to
a
consider
of
grant
independ
to
the
island
.
i
respect
submit
that
thi
condit
preced
have
been

,
it
is
now
our
liberti
and
our
duti
to

laid
befor

gentlemen
,
as

,
of
the

i
wa
bred

it
is
my
solemn
purpos
to

of
all
the
victori
which
await
