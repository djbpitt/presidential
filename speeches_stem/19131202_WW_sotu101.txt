we

and
then
,
when

we

i
turn

you
alreadi
have
under

for
which
the

i

i

the

it

i

i
think
it

that

stand

unalt
,
as
it

with
it

that
we
should
as
much
as
possibl
reduc
the

no

thi
to

it
is
of

the

i

promptli

the

i

i
do
not
misinterpret

i
urg
the

i
ventur
the
suggest

for

and
i
suggest
that
these

should
consist
not
of
deleg

for
thi
singl
purpos
,
but
of
the
nomine
for
congress
,
the

these
are
all

such

no

selfishli
exploit
;
they
are
part
of
the
domain
of

we
must
administ
them

with
the

sens
of

as
toward

no

we

bind
porto

the

the

one

these
the

is

we

yet
the
principl

object
are
the

,
wherev
we
touch

we

use

not

there

for
there
can

the
