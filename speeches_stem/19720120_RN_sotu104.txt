along

albert

and
listen
for
the
first
time
to
the
presid
address
the
state
of
the
union
.
i
shall
never
forget
that
moment
.
the

the
diplomat
corp
,
the
suprem
court
,
the
cabinet
enter
the
chamber
,
and
then
the
presid
of
the
unit
state
.
as
all
of
you
are
awar
,
i
had
some
differ
with
presid

had
some

me
.
but
i
rememb
that
on
that
day
--
the
day
he
address
that
joint
session
of
the
newli
elect
republican
80th
congress
,
he
spoke
not
as
a
partisan
,
but
as
presid
of
all
the
people-cal
upon
the
congress
to
put
asid
partisan
consider
in
the
nation
interest
.
the
greek-turkish
aid
program
,
the
marshal
plan
,
the
great
foreign
polici
initi
which
have
been
respons
for
avoid
a
world
war
for
over
25
year
were
approv
by
the
80th
congress
,
by
a
bipartisan
major
of
which
i
wa
proud
to
be
a
part
.
nineteen
hundr
seventy-two
is
now
befor
us
.
it
hold
preciou
time
in
which
to
accomplish
good
for
the
nation
.
we
must
not
wast
it
.
i
know
the
polit
pressur
in
thi
session
of
the
congress
will
be
great
.
there
are
more
candid
for
the
presid
in
thi
chamber
today
than
there
probabl
have
been
at
ani
one
time
in
the
whole
histori
of
the
republ
.
and
there
is
an
honest
differ
of
opinion
,
not
onli
between
the
parti
,
but
within
each
parti
,
on
some
foreign
polici
issu
and
on
some
domest
polici
issu
.
howev
,
there
are
great
nation
problem
that
are
so
vital
that
they
transcend
partisanship
.
so
let
us
have
our
debat
.
let
us
have
our
honest
differ
.
but
let
us
join
in
keep
the
nation
interest
first
.
let
us
join
in
make
sure
that
legisl
the
nation
need
doe
not
becom
hostag
to
the
polit
interest
of
ani
parti
or
ani
person
.
there
is
ampl
preced
,
in
thi
elect
year
,
for
me
to
present
you
with
a
huge
list
of
new
propos
,
know
full
well
that
there
would
not
be
ani
possibl
of
your
pass
them
if
you
work
night
and
day
.
i
shall
not
do
that
.
i
have
present
to
the
leader
of
the
congress
today
a
messag
of
15,000
word
discuss
in
some
detail
where
the
nation
stand
and
set
forth
specif
legisl
item
on
which
i
have
ask
the
congress
to
act
.
much
of
thi
is
legisl
which
i
propos
in
1969
,
in
1970
,
and
also
in
the
first
session
of
thi
92d
congress
and
on
which
i
feel
it
is
essenti
that
action
be
complet
thi
year
.
i
am
not
present
propos
which
have
attract
label
but
no
hope
of
passag
.
i
am
present
onli
vital
program
which
are
within
the
capac
of
thi
congress
to
enact
,
within
the
capac
of
the
budget
to
financ
,
and
which
i
believ
should
be
abov
partisanship
--
program
which
deal
with
urgent
prioriti
for
the
nation
,
which
should
and
must
be
the
subject
of
bipartisan
action
by
thi
congress
in
the
interest
of
the
countri
in
1972
.
when
i
took
the
oath
of
offic
on
the
step
of
thi
build
just
3
year
ago
today
,
the
nation
wa
end
one
of
the
most
tortur
decad
in
it
histori
.
the
1960
's
were
a
time
of
great
progress
in
mani
area
.
but
as
we
all
know
,
they
were
also
time
of
great
agoni
--
the
agoni
of
war
,
of
inflat
,
of
rapidli
rise
crime
,
of
deterior
titl
,
of
hope
rais
and
disappoint
,
and
of
anger
and
frustrat
that
led
final
to
violenc
and
to
the
worst
civil
disord
in
a
centuri
.
i
recal
these
troubl
not
to
point
ani
finger
of
blame
.
the
nation
wa
so
torn
in
those
final
year
of
the
sixti
that
mani
in
both
parti
question
whether
america
could
be
govern
at
all
.
the
nation
ha
made
signific
progress
in
these
first
year
of
the
seventi
:
our
citi
are
no
longer
engulf
by
civil
disord
.
our
colleg
and
univers
have
again
becom
place
of
learn
instead
of
battleground
.
a
begin
ha
been
made
in
preserv
and
protect
our
environ
.
the
rate
of
increas
in
crime
ha
been
slow
--
and
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
,
the
one
citi
where
the
feder
govern
ha
direct
jurisdict
,
seriou
crime
in
1971
wa

by
13
percent
from
the
year
befor
.
most
import
,
becaus
of
the
begin
that
have
been
made
,
we
can
say
today
that
thi
year
1972
can
be
the
year
in
which
america
may
make
the
greatest
progress
in
25
year
toward
achiev
our
goal
of
be
at
peac
with
all
the
nation
of
the
world
.
as
our
involv
in
the
war
in
vietnam
come
to
an
end
,
we
must
now
go
on
to
build
a
gener
of
peac
.
to
achiev
that
goal
,
we
must
first
face
realist
the
need
to
maintain
our
defens
.
in
the
past
3
year
,
we
have
reduc
the
burden
of
arm
.
for
the
first
time
in
20
year
,
spend
on
defens
ha
been
brought
below
spend
on
human
resourc
.
as
we
look
to
the
futur
,
we
find
encourag
progress
in
our
negoti
with
the
soviet
union
on
limit
of
strateg
arm
.
and
look
further
into
the
futur
,
we
hope
there
can
eventu
be
agreement
on
the
mutual
reduct
of
arm
.
but
until
there
is
such
a
mutual
agreement
,
we
must
maintain
the
strength
necessari
to
deter
war
.
and
that
is
whi
,
becaus
of
rise
research
and
develop
cost
,
becaus
of
increas
in
militari
and
civilian
pay
,
becaus
of
the
need
to
proceed
with
new
weapon
system
,
my
budget
for
the
come
fiscal
year
will
provid
for
an
increas
in
defens
spend
.
strong
militari
defens
are
not
the
enemi
of
peac
;
they
are
the
guardian
of
peac
.
there
could
be
no
more
misguid
set
of
prioriti
than
one
which
would
tempt
other
by
weaken
america
,
and
therebi
endang
the
peac
of
the
world
.
in
our
foreign
polici
,
we
have
enter
a
new
era
.
the
world
ha
chang
greatli
in
the
11
year
sinc
presid
john
kennedi
said
in
hi
inaugur
address
,
``
...
we
shall
pay
ani

,
bear
ani

,

to
assur
the
surviv
and
the
success
of

''
our
polici
ha
been
care
and
deliber
adjust
to
meet
the
new
realiti
of
the
new
world
we
live
in
.
we
make
today
onli
those
commit
we
are
abl
and
prepar
to
meet
.
our
commit
to
freedom
remain
strong
and
unshak
.
but
other
must
bear
their
share
of
the
burden
of
defend
freedom
around
the
world
.
and
so
thi
,
then
,
is
our
polici
:
--
we
will
maintain
a
nuclear
deterr
adequ
to
meet
ani
threat
to
the
secur
of
the
unit
state
or
of
our
alli
.
--
we
will
help
other
nation
develop
the
capabl
of
defend
themselv
.
--
we
will
faith
honor
all
of
our
treati
commit
.
--
we
will
act
to
defend
our
interest
,
whenev
and
wherev
they
are
threaten
anyplac
in
the
world
.
--
but
where
our
interest
or
our
treati
commit
are
not
involv
,
our
role
will
be
limit
.
--
we
will
not
interven
militarili
.
--
but
we
will
use
our
influenc
to
prevent
war
.
--
if
war
come
,
we
will
use
our
influenc
to
stop
it
.
--
onc
it
is
over
,
we
will
do
our
share
in
help
to
bind
up
the
wound
of
those
who
have
particip
in
it
.
as
you
know
,
i
will
soon
be
visit
the
peopl
's
republ
of
china
and
the
soviet
union
.
i
go
there
with
no
illus
.
we
have
great
differ
with
both
power
.
we
shall
continu
to
have
great
differ
.
but
peac
depend
on
the
abil
of
great
power
to
live
togeth
on
the
same
planet
despit
their
differ
.
we
would
not
be
true
to
our
oblig
to
gener
yet
unborn
if
we
fail
to
seiz
thi
moment
to
do
everyth
in
our
power
to
insur
that
we
will
be
abl
to
talk
about
those
differ
,
rather
than
to
fight
about
them
,
in
the
futur
.
as
we
look
back
over
thi
centuri
,
let
us
,
in
the
highest
spirit
of
bipartisanship
,
recogn
that
we
can
be
proud
of
our
nation
's
record
in
foreign
affair
.
america
ha
given
more
gener
of
itself
toward
maintain
freedom
,
preserv
peac
,
allevi
human
suffer
around
the
globe
,
than
ani
nation
ha
ever
done
in
the
histori
of
man
.
we
have
fought
four
war
in
thi
centuri
,
but
our
power
ha
never
been
use
to
break
the
peac
,
onli
to
keep
it
;
never
been
use
to
destroy
freedom
,
onli
to
defend
it
.
we
now
have
within
our
reach
the
goal
of

that
the

the

when
the

will
be
broken
.
now
,
thi
a
good
record
,
but
it
is
not
good
enough
--
not
when
we
still
have
an
unemploy

of

it
is
not
enough
to
point
out
that
thi
wa
the
rate
of

that
if

were
still

our
goal
in

is
full

.
we
intend
to
meet
that
goal
,
and
we
can
.
the
congress
ha
help
to
meet
that
goal
by
pass
our
job-creat
tax
program
last

.
the
histor
monetari
agreement
,
agreement
that
we
have
reach
with
the
major
european
nation
,
canada
,
and
japan
,
will
help
meet
it
by
provid
new
market
for
american
product
,
new

for
american
worker
.
our
budget
will
help
meet
it
by

without

inflationary-a
job-produc
budget
that
will
help
take
up

in

we
demonstr
what

now
the

come

,
of

the
wonder

i
shall
soon
send

histor

our
superior

have
made
it
possibl
for
american

to
be
the
highest
paid
in

world
by
far
,
and
yet
for

still
to

in

market
.
now
we
face
a
new
situat
.
as
other
nation
move
rapidli
forward
in
technolog
,
the
answer
to
the
new
competit
is
not
to
build
a
wall
around
america
,
but
rather
to
remain
competit
by
improv
our
own
technolog
still
further
and
by
increas
product
in

.
our
new

will
make
it
possibl
for
american
good
to
compet
fairli
in
the
world

but
they
still
must
compet
.
the
new

program
will
put
to
use
the
skill
of

american
,
skill
that
might
otherwis
be

it
will
also
meet
the
grow
technolog
challeng
from
abroad
,
and
it
will
thu
help
to
creat
new

as
well
as
creat

now

action
by
the
congress
,
for
the
nation
and
for
the
peopl
of
america
.
now
,
in
addit
,
there
is
one
press
need
which
i
have
not
previous
cover
,
but
which
must
be
place
on
the
nation
agenda
.
we
long
have
look
in
thi
nation
to
the
local
properti
tax
as
the
main
sourc
of
financ
for
public
primari
and
secondari
educ
.
as
a
result
,
soar
school
cost
,
soar
properti
tax
rate
now
threaten
both
our
commun
and
our
school
.
they
threaten
commun
becaus
properti
tax
,
which
more
than
doubl
in
the
10
year
from
1960
to
'70
,
have
becom
one
of
the
most
oppress
and
discriminatori
of
all
tax
,
hit
most
cruelli
at
the
elderli
and
the
retir
;
and
they
threaten
school
,
as
hard-press
voter
understand
reject
new
bond
issu
at
the
poll
.
the
problem
ha
been
given
even
greater
urgenc
by
four
recent
court
decis
,
which
have
held
that
the
convent
method
of
financ
school
through
local
properti
tax
is
discriminatori
and
unconstitut
.
nearli
2
year
ago
,
i
name
a
special
presidenti
commiss
to
studi
the
problem
of
school
financ
,
and
i
also
direct
the
feder
depart
to
look
into
the
same
problem
.
we
are
develop
comprehens
propos
to
meet
these
problem
.
thi
issu
involv
two
complex
and
interrel
set
of
problem
:
support
of
the
school
and
the
basic
relationship
of
feder
,
state
,
and
local
govern
in
ani
tax
reform
.
under
the
leadership
of
the
secretari
of
the
treasuri
,
we
are
care
review
all
of
the
tax
aspect
,
and
i
have
thi
week
enlist
the
advisori
commiss
on
intergovernment
relat
in
address
the
intergovernment
relat
aspect
.
i
have
ask
thi
bipartisan
commiss
to
review
our
propos
for
feder
action
to
cope
with
the
gather
crisi
of
school
financ
and
properti
tax
.
later
in
the
year
,
when
both
commiss
have
complet
their
studi
,
i
shall
make
my
final
recommend
for
reliev
the
burden
of
properti
tax
and
provid
both
fair
and
adequ
financ
for
our
children
's
educ
.
these
recommend
will
be
revolutionari
.
but
all
these
recommend
,
howev
,
will
be
root
in
one
fundament
principl
with
which
there
can
be
no
compromis
:
local
school
board
must
have
control
over
local
school
.
as
we
look
ahead
over
the
come
decad
,
vast
new
growth
and
chang
are
not
onli
certainti
,
they
will
be
the
domin
realiti
of
thi
world
,
and
particularli
of
our
life
in
america
.
survey
the
certainti
of
rapid
chang
,
we
can
be
like
a
fallen
rider
caught
in
the
stirrup
--
r
we
can
sit
high
in
the
saddl
,
the
master
of
chang
,
direct
it
on
a
cours
we
choos
.
the
secret
of
master
chang
in
today
's
world
is
to
reach
back
to
old
and
proven
principl
,
and
to
adapt
them
with
imagin
and
intellig
to
the
new
realiti
of
a
new
age
.
that
is
what
we
have
done
in
the
propos
that
i
have
laid
befor
the
congress
.
they
are
root
in
basic
principl
that
are
as
endur
as
human
natur
,
as
robust
as
the
american
experi
;
and
they
are
respons
to
new
condit
.
thu
they
repres
a
spirit
of
chang
that
is
truli
renew
.
as
we
look
back
at
those
old
principl
,
we
find
them
as
time
as
they
are
timeless
.
we
believ
in
independ
,
and
self-reli
,
and
the
creativ
valu
of
the
competit
spirit
.
we
believ
in
full
and
equal
opportun
for
all
american
and
in
the
protect
of
individu
right
and
liberti
.
we
believ
in
the
famili
as
the
keyston
of
the
commun
,
and
in
the
commun
as
the
keyston
of
the
nation
.
we
believ
in
compass
toward
those
in
need
.
we
believ
in
a
system
of
law
,
justic
,
and
order
as
the
basi
of
a
genuin
free
societi
.
we
believ
that
a
person
should
get
what
he
work
for
--
and
that
those
who
can
,
should
work
for
what
they
get
.
we
believ
in
the
capac
of
peopl
to
make
their
own
decis
in
their
own
live
,
in
their
own
commun
--
and
we
believ
in
their
right
to
make
those
decis
.
in
appli
these
principl
,
we
have
done
so
with
the
full
understand
that
what
we
seek
in
the
seventi
,
what
our
quest
is
,
is
not
mere
for
more
,
but
for
better
for
a
better
qualiti
of
life
for
all
american
.
thu
,
for
exampl
,
we
are
give
a
new
measur
of
attent
to
clean
up
our
air
and
water
,
make
our
surround
more
attract
.
we
are
provid
broader
support
for
the
art
,
help
stimul
a
deeper
appreci
of
what
they
can
contribut
to
the
nation
's
activ
and
to
our
individu
live
.
but
noth
realli
matter
more
to
the
qualiti
of
our
live
than
the
way
we
treat
one
anoth
,
than
our
capac
to
live
respect
togeth
as
a
unifi
societi
,
with
a
full
,
gener
regard
for
the
right
of
other
and
also
for
the
feel
of
other
.
as
we
recov
from
the
turmoil
and
violenc
of
recent
year
,
as
we
learn
onc
again
to
speak
with
one
anoth
instead
of
shout
at
one
anoth
,
we
are
regain
that
capac
.
as
is
customari
here
,
on
thi
occas
,
i
have
been
talk
about
program
.
program
are
import
.
but
even
more
import
than
program
is
what
we
are
as
a
nation
--
what
we
mean
as
a
nation
,
to
ourselv
and
to
the
world
.
in
new
york
harbor
stand
one
of
the
most
famou
statu
in
the
world
--
the
statu
of
liberti
,
the
gift
in
1886
of
the
peopl
of
franc
to
the
peopl
of
the
unit
state
.
thi
statu
is
more
than
a
landmark
;
it
is
a
symbol
--
a
symbol
of
what
america
ha
meant
to
the
world
.
it
remind
us
that
what
america
ha
meant
is
not
it
wealth
,
and
not
it
power
,
but
it
spirit
and
purpos
--
a
land
that
enshrin
liberti
and
opportun
,
and
that
ha
held
out
a
hand
of
welcom
to
million
in
search
of
a
better
and
a
fuller
and
,
abov
all
,
a
freer
life
.
the
world
's
hope
pour
into
america
,
along
with
it
peopl
.
and
those
hope
,
those
dream
,
that
have
been
brought
here
from
everi
corner
of
the
world
,
have
becom
a
part
of
the
hope
that
we
now
hold
out
to
the
world
.
four
year
from
now
,
america
will
celebr
the
200th
anniversari
of
it
found
as
a
nation
.
there
are
those
who
say
that
the
old
spirit
of
'76
is
dead
--
-that
we
no
longer
have
the
strength
of
charact
,
the
ideal
,
the
faith
in
our
found
purpos
that
that
spirit
repres
.
those
who
say
thi
do
not
know
america
.
we
have
been
undergo
self-doubt
and
self-critic
.
but
these
are
onli
the
other
side
of
our
grow
sensit
to
the
persist
of
want
in
the
midst
of
plenti
,
of
our
impati
with
the
slow
with
which
age-old
ill
are
be
overcom
.
if
we
were
indiffer
to
the
shortcom
of
our
societi
,
or
complac
about
our
institut
,
or
blind
to
the
linger
inequ
--
then
we
would
have
lost
our
way
.
but
the
fact
that
we
have
those
concern
is
evid
that
our
ideal
,
deep
down
,
are
still
strong
.
inde
,
they
remind
us
that
what
is
realli
best
about
america
is
it
compass
.
they
remind
us
that
in
the
final
analysi
,
america
is
great
not
becaus
it
is
strong
,
not
becaus
it
is
rich
,
but
becaus
thi
is
a
good
countri
.
let
us
reject
the
narrow
vision
of
those
who
would
tell
us
that
we
are
evil
becaus
we
are
not
yet
perfect
,
that
we
are
corrupt
becaus
we
are
not
yet
pure
,
that
all
the
sweat
and
toil
and
sacrific
that
have
gone
into
the
build
of
america
were
for
naught
becaus
the
build
is
not
yet
done
.
let
us
see
that
the
path
we
are
travel
is
wide
,
with
room
in
it
for
all
of
us
,
and
that
it
direct
is
toward
a
better
nation
and
a
more
peac
world
.
never
ha
it
matter
more
that
we
go
forward
togeth
.
look
at
thi
chamber
.
the
leadership
of
america
is
here
today
--
the
suprem
court
,
the
cabinet
,
the
senat
,
the
hous
of
repres
.
togeth
,
we
hold
the
futur
of
the
nation
,
and
the
conscienc
of
the
nation
in
our
hand
.
becaus
thi
year
is
an
elect
year
,
it
will
be
a
time
of
great
pressur
.
if
we
yield
to
that
pressur
and
fail
to
deal
serious
with
the
histor
challeng
that
we
face
,
we
will
have
fail
the
trust
of
million
of
american
and
shaken
the
confid
they
have
a
right
to
place
in
us
,
in
their
govern
.
never
ha
a
congress
had
a
greater
opportun
to
leav
a
legaci
of
a
profound
and
construct
reform
for
the
nation
than
thi
congress
.
if
we
succeed
in
these
task
,
there
will
be
credit
enough
for
all
--
not
onli
for
do
what
is
right
,
but
do
it
in
the
right
way
,
by
rise
abov
partisan
interest
to
serv
the
nation
interest
.
and
if
we
fail
,
more
than
ani
one
of
us
,
america
will
be
the
loser
.
that
is
whi
my
call
upon
the
congress
today
is
for
a
high
statesmanship
,
so
that
in
the
year
to
come
american
will
look
back
and
say
becaus
it
withstood
the
intens
pressur
of
a
polit
year
,
and
achiev
such
great
good
for
the
american
peopl
and
for
the
futur
of
thi
nation
,
thi
wa
truli
a
great
congress
.
