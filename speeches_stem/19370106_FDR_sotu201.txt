mr.

mr.
speaker
,
member
of
the

of
the
unit
state
:
for
the
first
time
in
our
nation
histori
a
presid
deliv
hi
annual
messag
to
a
new

within
a

while
there
is
no
chang
in
the

thi
year
,
chang
will
occur
in
futur
year
.
it
is
my
belief
that
under
thi
new
constitut
practic
,
the
presid
should
in
everi
fourth
year
,
in
so
far
as
seem
reason
,
review
the
exist
state
of
our
nation
affair
and
outlin
broad
futur
problem
,
leav
specif
recommend
for
futur
legisl
to
be
made
by
the
presid
about
to
be
inaugur
.
at
thi
time
,
howev
,
circumst
of
the
moment
compel
me
to
ask
your
immedi
consider
of
:
first
,
measur
extend
the
life
of
certain
author
and
power
which
,
under
present
statut
,
expir
within
a
few
week
;
second
,
an
addit
to
the
exist
neutral
act
to
cover
specif
point
rais
by
the
unfortun
civil
strife
in
spain
;
and
,
third
,
a
defici
appropri
bill
for
which
i
shall
submit
estim
thi
week
.
in
march
,
1933
,
the
problem
which
face
our
nation
and
which
onli
our
nation
govern
had
the
resourc
to
meet
were
more
seriou
even
than
appear
on
the
surfac
.
it
wa
not
onli
that
the
visibl
mechan
of
econom
life
had
broken
down
.
more
disturb
wa
the
fact
that
long
neglect
of
the
need
of
the
underprivileg
had
brought
too
mani
of
our
peopl
to
the
verg
of
doubt
as
to
the
success
adapt
of
our
histor
tradit
to
the
complex
modern
world
.
in
that
lay
a
challeng
to
our
democrat
form
of
govern
itself
.
our
wa
the
task
to
prove
that
democraci
could
be
made
to
function
in
the
world
of
today
as
effect
as
in
the
simpler
world
of
a
hundr
year
ago
.
our
wa
the
task
to
do
more
than
to
argu
a
theori
.
the
time
requir
the
confid
answer
of
perform
to
those
whose
instinct
faith
in
human
made
them
want
to
believ
that
in
the
long
run
democraci
would
prove
superior
to
more
extrem
form
of
govern
as
a
process
of
get
action
when
action
wa
wisdom
,
without
the
spiritu
sacrific
which
those
other
form
of
govern
exact
.
that
challeng
we
met
.
to
meet
it
requir
unpreced
activ
under
feder
leadership
to
end
abus
,
to
restor
a
larg
measur
of
materi
prosper
,
to
give
new
faith
to
million
of
our
citizen
who
had
been
tradit
taught
to
expect
that
democraci
would
provid
continu
wider
opportun
and
continu
greater
secur
in
a
world
where
scienc
wa
continu
make
materi
rich
more
avail
to
man
.
in
the
mani
method
of
attack
with
which
we
met
these
problem
,
you
and
i
,
by
mutual
understand
and
by
determin
to
cooper
,
help
to
make
democraci
succeed
by
refus
to
permit
unnecessari
disagr
to
aris
between
two
of
our
branch
of
govern
.
that
spirit
of
cooper
wa
abl
to
solv
difficulti
of
extraordinari
magnitud
and
ramif
with
few
import
error
,
and
at
a
cost
cheap
when
measur
by
the
immedi
necess
and
the
eventu
result
.
i
look
forward
to
a
continu
of
that
cooper
in
the
next
four
year
.
i
look
forward
also
to
a
continu
of
the
basi
of
that
cooperation-
mutual
respect
for
each
other
's
proper
sphere
of
function
in
a
democraci
which
is
work
well
,
and
a
common-sens
realiz
of
the
need
for
play
in
the
joint
of
the
machin
.
on
that
basi
,
it
is
within
the
right
of
the
congress
to
determin
which
of
the
mani
new
activ
shall
be
continu
or
abandon
,
increas
or
curtail
.
on
that
same
basi
,
the
presid
alon
ha
the
respons
for
their
administr
.
i
find
that
thi
task
of
execut
manag
ha
reach
the
point
where
our
administr
machineri
need
comprehens
overhaul
.
i
shall
,
therefor
,
shortli
address
the
congress
more
fulli
in
regard
to
modern
and
improv
the
execut
branch
of
the
govern
.
that
cooper
of
the
past
four
year
between
the
congress
and
the
presid
ha
aim
at
the
fulfil
of
a
twofold
polici
:
first
,
econom
recoveri
through
mani
kind
of
assist
to
agricultur
,
industri
and
bank
;
and
,
second
,
deliber
improv
in
the
person
secur
and
opportun
of
the
great
mass
of
our
peopl
.
the
recoveri
we
sought
wa
not
to
be
mere
temporari
.
it
wa
to
be
a
recoveri
protect
from
the
caus
of
previou
disast
.
with
that
aim
in
view—to
prevent
a
futur
similar
crisis-y
and
i
join
in
a
seri
of
enactments—saf
bank
and
sound
currenc
,
the
guarante
of
bank
deposit
,
protect
for
the
investor
in
secur
,
the
remov
of
the
threat
of
agricultur
surplus
,
insist
on
collect
bargain
,
the
outlaw
of
sweat
shop
,
child
labor
and
unfair
trade
practic
,
and
the
begin
of
secur
for
the
age
and
the
worker
.
nor
wa
the
recoveri
we
sought
mere
a
purposeless
whir
of
machineri
.
it
is
import
,
of
cours
,
that
everi
man
and
woman
in
the
countri
be
abl
to
find
work
,
that
everi
factori
run
,
that
busi
and
farm
as
a
whole
earn
profit
.
but
govern
in
a
democrat
nation
doe
not
exist
sole
,
or
even
primarili
,
for
that
purpos
.
it
is
not
enough
that
the
wheel
turn
.
they
must
carri
us
in
the
direct
of
a
greater
satisfact
in
life
for
the
averag
man
.
the
deeper
purpos
of
democrat
govern
is
to
assist
as
mani
of
it
citizen
as
possibl
,
especi
those
who
need
it
most
,
to
improv
their
condit
of
life
,
to
retain
all
person
liberti
which
doe
not
advers
affect
their
neighbor
,
and
to
pursu
the
happi
which
come
with
secur
and
an
opportun
for
recreat
and
cultur
.
even
with
our
present
recoveri
we
are
far
from
the
goal
of
that
deeper
purpos
.
there
are
far-reach
problem
still
with
us
for
which
democraci
must
find
solut
if
it
is
to
consid
itself
success
.
for
exampl
,
mani
million
of
american
still
live
in
habit
which
not
onli
fail
to
provid
the
physic
benefit
of
modern
civil
but
breed
diseas
and
impair
the
health
of
futur
gener
.
the
menac
exist
not
onli
in
the
slum
area
of
the
veri
larg
citi
,
but
in
mani
smaller
citi
as
well
.
it
exist
on
ten
of
thousand
of
farm
,
in
vari
degre
,
in
everi
part
of
the
countri
.
anoth
exampl
is
the
preval
of
an
un-american
type
of
tenant
farm
.
i
do
not
suggest
that
everi
farm
famili
ha
the
capac
to
earn
a
satisfactori
live
on
it
own
farm
.
but
mani
thousand
of
tenant
farmer
,
inde
most
of
them
,
with
some
financi
assist
and
with
some
advic
and
train
,
can
be
made
self-support
on
land
which
can
eventu
belong
to
them
.
the
nation
would
be
wise
to
offer
them
that
chanc
instead
of
permit
them
to
go
along
as
they
do
now
,
year
after
year
,
with
neither
futur
secur
as
tenant
nor
hope
of
ownership
of
their
home
nor
expect
of
better
the
lot
of
their
children

anoth
nation
problem
is

of

the
most
far-reach

i
shall

the

problem
which
result
from

which
conduct

scant

dure
the
past
year
there
ha
been
a
grow
belief
that
there
is
littl
fault
to
be
found
with
the
constitut
of
the
unit
state
as
it
stand
today
.
the
vital
need
is
not
an
alter
of
our
fundament
law
,
but
an
increasingli
enlighten
view
with
refer
to
it
.
difficulti
have
grown
out
of
it
interpret
;
but
rightli
consid
,
it
can
be
use
as
an
instrument
of
progress
,
and
not
as
a
devic
for
prevent
of
action
.
it
is
worth
our
while
to
read
and
reread
the
preambl
of
the
constitut
,
and
articl
i
thereof
which
confer
the
legisl
power
upon
the
congress
of
the
unit
state
.
it
is
also
worth
our
while
to
read
again
the
debat
in
the
constitut
convent
of
one
hundr
and
fifti
year
ago
.
from
such
read
,
i
obtain
the
veri
definit
thought
that
the
member
of
that
convent
were
fulli
awar
that
civil
would
rais
problem
for
the
propos
new

which
they
themselv
could
not

surmis

and
that
it
wa
their
definit
intent
and
expect
that
a
liber
interpret
in
the
year
to
come
would
give
to
the
congress
the
same
rel
power
over
new
nation
problem
as
they
themselv
gave
to
the
congress
over
the
nation
problem
of
their
day
.
in
present
to
the
convent
the
first
basic
draft
of
the
constitut
,
edmund
randolph
explain
that
it

with

of
all
the
democraci
of
the
world
to
those
nation
which

.
becaus
such
other
govern
are
perhap
more
spectacular
,
it
wa
high
time
for
democraci
to
assert
itself
.
becaus
all
of
us
believ
that
our
democrat
form
of
govern
can
cope
adequ
with
modern
problem
as
they
aris
,
it
is
patriot
as
well
as
logic
for
us
to
prove
that
we
can

the
unit
state
of
america
,
within
itself
,
must
continu
the
task
of
make
democraci
succeed
.
in
that
task
the
legisl
branch
of
our
govern
will
,
i
am
confid
,
continu
to
meet
the
demand
of
democraci
whether
they
relat
to
the
curb
of
abus
,
the
extens
of
help
to
those
who
need
help
,
or
the
better
balanc
of
our
interdepend
economi
.
so
,
too
,
the
execut
branch
of
the
govern
must
move
forward
in
thi
task
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
provid
better

the
judici
branch
also
is
ask
by
the
peopl
to
do
it
part
in
make
democraci
success
.
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
call
non-exist
power
into
be
,
but
we
have
a
right
to
expect
that
conced
power
or
those
legitim

for
the
common
good
.
the
process
of
our
democraci
must
not
be
imperil
by
the
denial
of
essenti
power
of
free

.
your
task
and
mine
is

the
