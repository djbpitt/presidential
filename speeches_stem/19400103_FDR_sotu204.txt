i
wish

of

a

.
as
the
congress
reassembl
,
the
impact
of
war
abroad
make
it
natur
to
approach
``
the
state
of
the

''
through
a
discuss
of
foreign
affair
.
but
it
is
import
that
those
who
hear
and
read
thi
messag
should
in
no
way
confus
that
approach
with
ani
thought
that
our
govern
is
abandon
,
or
even
overlook
,
the
great
signific
of
it
domest
polici
.
the
social
and
econom
forc
which
have
been
mismanag
abroad
until
they
have
result
in
revolut
,
dictatorship
and
war
are
the
same
as
those
which
we
here
are
struggl
to
adjust
peac
at

.
you
are
well
awar
that
dictatorships—and
the
philosophi
of

that

almost
everi

in

necess
for

in
place
where
democrat
action
for
one
reason
or
anoth
ha
fail
to
respond
to
modern
need
and
modern
demand
.
it
wa
with
far-sight
wisdom
that
the
framer
of
our
constitut
brought
togeth
in
one
magnific
phrase
three
great
concepts—
''
common
defens
,
''
``
gener
welfar
''
and
``
domest
tranquil
.
''
more
than
a
centuri
and
a
half
later
we
,
who
are
here
today
,
still
believ
with
them
that
our
best
defens
is
the
promot
of
our
gener
welfar
and
domest
tranquil
.
in
previou
messag
to
the
congress
i
have
repeatedli
warn
that
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
the
daili
live
of
american
citizen
will
,
of
necess
,
feel
the
shock
of
event
on
other
contin
.
thi
is
no
longer
mere
theori
;
becaus
it
ha
been
definit
prove
to
us
by
the
fact
of
yesterday
and
today
.
to
say
that
the
domest
well-b
of
one
hundr
and
thirti
million
american
is
deepli
affect
by
the
well-b
or
the
ill-b
of
the
popul
of
other
nation
is
onli
to
recogn
in
world
affair
the
truth
that
we
all
accept
in
home
affair
.
if
in
ani
local
unit-a
citi
,
counti
,
state
or
region—low
standard
of
live
are
permit
to
continu
,
the
level
of
the
civil
of
the
entir
nation
will
be
pull
downward
.
the
ident
principl
extend
to
the
rest
of
the
civil
world
.
but
there
are
those
who
wish
insist
,
in
innoc
or
ignor
or
both
,
that
the
unit
state
of
america
as
a
self-contain
unit
can
live
happili
and
prosper
,
it
futur
secur
,
insid
a
high
wall
of
isol
while
,
outsid
,
the
rest
of
civil
and
the
commerc
and
cultur
of
mankind
are
shatter
.
i
can
understand
the
feel
of
those
who
warn
the
nation
that
they
will
never
again
consent
to
the
send
of
american
youth
to
fight
on
the
soil
of
europ
.
but
,
as
i
rememb
,
nobodi
ha
ask
them
to
consent—for
nobodi
expect
such
an
undertak
.
the
overwhelm
major
of
our
fellow
citizen
do
not
abandon
in
the
slightest
their
hope
and
their
expect
that
the
unit
state
will
not
becom
involv
in
militari
particip
in
these
war
.
i
can
also
understand
the
wish
of
those
who
oversimplifi
the
whole
situat
by
repeat
that
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
mind
our
own
busi
and
keep
the
nation
out
of
war
.
but
there
is
a
vast
differ
between
keep
out
of
war
and
pretend
that
thi
war
is
none
of
our
busi
.
we
do
not
have
to
go
to
war
with
other
nation
,
but
at
least
we
can
strive
with
other
nation
to
encourag
the
kind
of
peac
that
will
lighten
the
troubl
of
the
world
,
and
by
so
do
help
our
own
nation
as
well
.
i
ask
that
all
of
us
everywher
think
thing
through
with
the
singl
aim
of
how
best
to
serv
the
futur
of
our
own
nation
.
i
do
not
mean
mere
it
futur
relationship
with
the
outsid
world
.
i
mean
it
domest
futur
as
well—th
work
,
the
secur
,
the
prosper
,
the
happi
,
the
life
of
all
the
boy
and
girl
in
the
unit
state
,
as
they
are
inevit
affect
by
such
world
relationship
.
for
it
becom
clearer
and
clearer
that
the
futur
world
will
be
a
shabbi
and
danger
place
to
live
in-y
,
even
for
american
to
live
in—if
it
is
rule
by
forc
in
the
hand
of
a
few
.
alreadi
the
crash
of
swiftli
move
event
over
the
earth
ha
made
us
all
think
with
a
longer
view
.
fortun
,
that
think
can
not
be
control
by
partisanship
.
the
time
is
long
past
when
ani
polit
parti
or
ani
particular
group
can
curri
or
captur
public
favor
by
label
itself
the
``
peac
parti
''
or
the
``
peac
bloc
.
''
that
label
belong
to
the
whole
unit
state
and
to
everi
right
think
man
,
woman
and
child
within
it
.
for
out
of
all
the
militari
and
diplomat
turmoil
,
out
of
all
the
propaganda
,
and
counter-propaganda
of
the
present
conflict
,
there
are
two
fact
which
stand
out
,
and
which
the
whole
world
acknowledg
.
the
first
is
that
never
befor
ha
the
govern
of
the
unit
state
of
america
done
so
much
as
in
our
recent
past
to
establish
and
maintain
the
polici
of
the
good
neighbor
with
it
sister
nation
.
the
second
is
that
in
almost
everi
nation
in
the
world
today
there
is
a
true
public
belief
that
the
unit
state
ha
been
,
and
will
continu
to
be
,
a
potent
and
activ
factor
in
seek
the
reestablish
of
world
peac
.
in
these
recent
year
we
have
had
a
clean
record
of
peac
and
good-wil
.
it
is
an
open
book
that
can
not
be
twist
or
defam
.
it
is
a
record
that
must
be
continu
and
enlarg
.
so
i
hope
that
american
everywher
will
work
out
for
themselv
the
sever
altern
which
lie
befor
world
civil
,
which
necessarili
includ
our
own
.
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
possibl
for
our
children
if
the
rest
of
the
world
come
to
be
domin
by
concentr
forc
alone—even
though
today
we
are
a
veri
great
and
a
veri
power
nation
.
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
effect
on
our
own
futur
if
all
the
small
nation
of
the
world
have
their
independ
snatch
from
them
or
becom
mere
appendag
to
rel
vast
and
power
militari
system
.
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
kind
of
live
our
children
would
have
to
lead
if
a
larg
part
of
the
rest
of
the
world
were
compel
to
worship
a
god
impos
by
a
militari
ruler
,
or
were
forbidden
to
worship
god
at
all
;
if
the
rest
of
the
world
were
forbidden
to
read
and
hear
the
facts—th
daili
news
of
their
own
and
other
nations—if
they
were
depriv
of
the
truth
that
make
men
free
.
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
effect
on
our
futur
gener
if
world
trade
is
control
by
ani
nation
or
group
of
nation
'which
set
up
that
control
through
militari
forc
.
it
is
,
of
cours
,
true
that
the
record
of
past
centuri
includ
destruct
of
mani
small
nation
,
the
enslav
of
peopl
,
and
the
build
of
empir
on
the
foundat
of
forc
.
but
wholli
apart
from
the
greater
intern
moral
which
we
seek
today
,
we
recogn
the
practic
fact
that
with
modern
weapon
and
modern
condit
,
modern
man
can
no
longer
lead
a
civil
life
if
we
are
to
go
back
to
the
practic
of
war
and
conquest
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuri
.
sum
up
thi
need
of
look
ahead
,
and
in
word
of
common
sens
and
good
american
citizenship
.
i
hope
that
we
shall
have
fewer
american
ostrich
in
our
midst
.
it
is
not
good
for
the
ultim
health
of
ostrich
to
buri
their
head
in

onli

look
upon

of

,
the
peopl
of

have
the
right
to
choos
their
own
form
of

but
we
in
thi
nation
still
believ
that
such

be

which
we
think
are

we
know
that

everyon
recogn

of

to

we
are
in
such
a

our

is

therefor

made

and
when

the

must
use

for

the

even

thi

in

i

ask

for

not

on

they
are
not

they

as
will

the

is
the

practic
all

but
you
know

you
ca
n't

therefor
,
in

hope
that
we
can
continu

behind

lie
our
ultim

of

of

we
can
not

despit
all
the

that
we
have
made

our
domest

the
fact
that

is
back
to

levels—that
all
our
problem
are

the
fact
of

remain
a
symptom
of
a

in

while
