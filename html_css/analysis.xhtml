                <h3>Comparison Through Time</h3>
                <p> When analysing the results of topic modelling, it was initially somewhat
                    baffling why certain key words were grouped into different topics. It was only
                    after taking "time" into account, that this became easier to understand. This
                    concept was well demonstrated in the article, <a
                        href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/the-language-of-the-state-of-the-union/384575/"
                        target="new">The Language of the State of the Union</a> by Benjamin Schmidt
                    and Mitch Fraas in The Atlantic. Although in their interactive chart, they were
                    graphing words rather than topics, the concept is the same. For example, in
                    their chart, by selecting the words "Treasury" or "Budget", it shows when they
                    are most frequently used.</p>
                <p><img src="img/treasury.png" alt="Treasury" /><img src="img/budget.png"
                        alt="Budget" /></p>
                <p style="clear:both;"><br /></p>
                <p> A similar pattern could be seen when looking at topics. For example, at <a
                        href="https://github.com/djbpitt/presidential/blob/master/data/wnl_para_keys14.txt"
                        >14 topics</a>, topics 7 and 8 both concern "money" matters. Here are the
                    key words:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Topic #</th>
                        <th>Key Words</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>7</td>
                        <td>year wa <b>fiscal expenditure revenue</b> june <i>silver</i> number
                                <b>treasury</b> total increase <b>pension</b> government
                                <i>amount</i> receipt day <b>cent</b> sum <b>money</b>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>8</td>
                        <td><i>job</i> american year <b>tax</b> business <i>work</i> ve family make
                            time reform <i>million</i> home school <b>economy</b> tonight america
                            back <b>deficit</b></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>Topic 7, with key words like "treasury" and "expenditure" were consistently
                    marked for speeches from earlier parts of the corpus. While topic 8, with key
                    words like "economy" and "tax" were more consistently marked for speeches from
                    latter parts of the corpus. </p>
