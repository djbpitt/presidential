                <h2>Comparison Between Different Types of Speech</h2>
                <p> The corpus contains two types of speeches. In the chart below, the "<span
                        style="background-color:#9900ff">Inaugurals</span>" are represented by red
                    bars and the "<span style="background-color:#ff9900">State of the Union
                        (SoTU)</span>" are represented by blue bars. </p>
                <!--#include virtual="inc/bar_svg.svg" -->
                <p>The topic percentages are weighted in two ways. First, topic modeling output
                    provides a percentage of which topic the unit of text belongs to. Second, each
                    unit of text is weighted by the total word count in the unit. The following
                    steps were used, for each speech type, to generate the chart above:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At the unit of text level (each paragraph): <ol>
                            <li>Sum of all percentage per "<a href="/methodology.xhtml#superTopic"
                                    target="new">super-topic</a>"</li>
                            <li>Word count of the paragraph multiplied to the sum </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>At the corpus level: <ol>
                            <li>Sum of all the weighted word count from each paragraph</li>
                            <li>Use the sum and divide by total word count throughout corpus</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> With the constant caveat that this is based on a limited corpus, it is not
                    possible to say that different topics were represented in the two types of
                    speeches. However, the results above do show some difference for the speeches in
                    this corpus. The difference is most striking for the "Economy" topic at
                    approximately 12.55% and least obvious for the "Law" topic at only 1.36%.</p>

                <h2>Comparison Between Presidents</h2>
                <p> The corpus contains the speeches of 8 presidents. In the charts below, each <a
                        href="/methodology.xhtml#superTopic" target="new">super-topic</a> is
                    represented by a different color as follows: "<span
                        style="background-color:#e6ff00">War/Peace</span>"; "<span
                        style="background-color:#9900ff">Economy</span>"; "<span
                        style="background-color:#00ff99">Law</span>"; "<span
                        style="background-color:#ff9900">Sovereignty</span>".</p>
                <!--#include virtual="inc/pie_gw.svg" -->
                <!--#include virtual="inc/pie_jm.svg" -->
                <!--#include virtual="inc/pie_al.svg" -->
                <!--#include virtual="inc/pie_gc.svg" -->
                <!--#include virtual="inc/pie_ww.svg" -->
                <!--#include virtual="inc/pie_fdr.svg" -->
                <!--#include virtual="inc/pie_rn.svg" -->
                <!--#include virtual="inc/pie_bo.svg" -->
                <p> The topic percentages were determined in a very similar method to the type of
                    speech comparison seen above. As can be see from the pie charts above, there are
                    fairly large differences in which topics were prominent for which president. </p>
                <p> It's perhaps not surprising that 60.5% of FDR's speeches were considered
                    "War/Peace" topic, with a large portion of his time in office during WWII.
                    Similarly, it is not too surprising to see 52.02% of Obama's speeches focused on
                    "Economy" as he took office during the economic crisis of '08. One of the issues
                    revealed after generating these pie charts is regarding the unused topic
                    (represented in <span style="background-color:lightgray">grey</span>). During
                    the process of grouping topics into super-topics, topic 2 was disregarded
                    because it seems to mostly be greetings and salutations. This might be a fair
                    assumption for Cleveland's corpus when it only represent 1.45% of his speeches.
                    However, for Nixon's corpus, it represent a very substantial 12.25%.</p>
                <p> One possible way to ameliorate this problem is to use the 25-topic results
                    before grouping them into super-topics. This way the "greetings and salutations"
                    topic would possibly be seperated out more from the rest of the topics and
                    represent its percentages in the corpus better.</p>
                <p> The "Sovereignty" (in orange) super-topic also shows some change over time based
                    on the pie charts. The earlier presidents have approximately 20% of their
                    speeches in this category, while the latter half have less than 10%, with Nixon
                    and Obama having less than 5% in this topic. The "Economy" (in purple)
                    super-topic shows, somewhat, of the opposite trend.</p>

                <h2>Comparison Through Time</h2>
                <p> When analysing the results of topic modeling, it was initially somewhat baffling
                    why certain key words were grouped into different topics. It was only after
                    taking "time" into account, that this became easier to understand. This concept
                    was well demonstrated in the article, <a
                        href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/the-language-of-the-state-of-the-union/384575/"
                        target="new"><b>The Language of the State of the Union</b></a> by Benjamin
                    Schmidt and Mitch Fraas in The Atlantic. Although in their interactive chart,
                    they were graphing words rather than topics, the concept is the same. In two
                    examples of their chart below, by selecting the words "Treasury" or "Budget", it
                    shows when they are most frequently used.</p>
                <p><img src="img/treasury.png" alt="Treasury" /><img src="img/budget.png"
                        alt="Budget" /></p>
                <p style="clear:both;"><br /></p>
                <p> A similar pattern could be seen when looking at topics. For example, at <a
                        href="https://github.com/djbpitt/presidential/blob/master/data/wnl_para_keys14.txt"
                        >14 topics</a>, topics 7 and 8 both concern "money" matters. Here are the
                    key words:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Topic #</th>
                        <th>Key Words</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>7</td>
                        <td>year wa <b>fiscal expenditure revenue</b> june <i>silver</i> number
                                <b>treasury</b> total increase <b>pension</b> government

                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>8</td>
                        <td><i>job</i> american year <b>tax</b> business <i>work</i> ve family make

                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>Topic 7, with key words like "treasury" and "expenditure" were consistently
                    marked for speeches from earlier parts of the corpus. While topic 8, with key
                    words like "economy" and "tax" were more consistently marked for speeches from
                    latter parts of the corpus. </p>
