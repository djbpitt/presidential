                <h3>Topic Modelling</h3>
                <p> Before starting topic modelling, the text was prepared by lemmatizing the words.
                    Orginally the Porter stemmer was used, however, it was deemed too aggressive in
                    cutting off the word endings. It became hard to decipher the topic modelling
                    results, because it could not be determined what the word fragment actually
                    represented. Then the WordNet Lemmatizer (WNL) was used and the results were
                    more intelligible. Another prepatory step was to turn each paragraph of the
                    speech into its own .txt file. Once these steps were completed, topic modeling
                    can begin. </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/">MALLET</a> was the tool used for topic
                    modelling. The tutorial on how to use MALLET was from <a
                        href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet">The
                        Programming Historian</a>. Mallet was run from 5 to 25 topics (at increments
                    of 1) to see which would produce more useful results. Although at 5 or 6 topics,
                    it is still <a
                        href="https://github.com/djbpitt/presidential/blob/master/data/wnl_para_keys5.txt"
                        >possible to see</a> what some of the topics are, they seem too broad. Some
                    of the topics that were groupded together would probably have been split into
                    seperate topics if they were tagged manually. At <a
                        href="https://github.com/djbpitt/presidential/blob/master/data/wnl_para_keys25.txt"
                        >25 topics</a>, they became much more specific.</p>
                <p> When looking at the topic keys, some of them seem somewhat similar. It was not
                    clear why some of them might be seperate topics. For example, at <a
                        href="https://github.com/djbpitt/presidential/blob/master/data/wnl_para_keys14.txt"
                        >14 topics</a>, topics 7 and 8 can both be interpreted as "money" topics.
                    Here are the key words:</p>

                            <p>In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't
                                agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars'
                                worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.
                                These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military
                                readiness. They'd devastate priorities like education and energy and
                                medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery and cost us
                                hundreds of thousands of jobs. And that's why Democrats,
                                Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that
                                these cuts—known here in Washington as the sequester—are a really
                                bad idea.</p>
                            <p>Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts
                                by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job
                                training, Medicare, and Social Security benefits. That idea is even
                                worse.</p>

                    "budget" part. It might also be worth noting that the 7 and 8 seem to be from
                    two time periods. Topic 7 appears before FDR and topic 8 appears after. By
                    looking at the data from topic modeling and examining possible variables,
                    comparisons can be made based on some of these variables.</p>

                <h3>Dynamic Index with PHP</h3>
                <p> The speeches pages includes an Index panel. It includes links to every speech.
                    This index could be created simply by manually writing the html. However, this
                    is a time consuming task if the corpus includes hundreds of files. It is also an
                    issue when new documents are added to the corpus. One way to resolve this is by
                    dynamically generating the index with PHP. </p>
                <p> The method used includes two parts. First, create an array that store the titles
                    of each document. The second part is to output the values stored in the array
                    and add html format to them. The .php file can be seen <a
                        href="https://github.com/djbpitt/presidential/blob/master/html_css/speeches.php"
                        >here</a>. The first part of the php was originally written by Dr. Birnbaum.
                    This section created an array called "presidents". It stored the name of the
                    presidents as the key. The value of each key is another array called "author".
                    This array contained the values of title of each speech and the date. The second
                    part of the php "read" the values of the array and displayed them in a nested
                    list. It read each key of the "presidents" array, and displayed it as a small
                    header. Then it read each "author" array, and displayed every valued contained
                    within as a list. </p>
