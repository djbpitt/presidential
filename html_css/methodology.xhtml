                <h3>Topic Modelling</h3>
                <p> Before starting topic modelling, the text was prepared by lemmatizing the words.
                    Orginally the Porter stemmer was used, however, it was deemed too aggressive in
                    cutting off the word endings. It became hard to decipher the topic modelling
                    results, because it could not be determined what the word fragment actually
                    represented. Then the WordNet Lemmatizer (WNL) was used and the results were
                    more intelligible. Another prepatory step was to turn each paragraph of the
                    speech into its own .txt file. Once these steps were completed, topic modeling
                    can begin. </p>

                    modelling. The tutorial on how to use MALLET was from <a
