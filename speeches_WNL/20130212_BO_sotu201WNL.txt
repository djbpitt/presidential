please
,
everybody
,
have
a
seat
.
mr.
speaker
,
mr.
vice
president
,
member
of
congress
,
fellow
american
:
fifty-one
year
ago
,
john
f.
kennedy
declared
to
this
chamber
that
``
the
constitution
make
u
not
rival
for
power
,
but
partner
for
progress
.
''
``
it
is
my
task
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
report
the
state
of
the
union
;
to
improve
it
is
the
task
of
u
all
.
''
tonight
,
thanks
to
the
grit
and
determination
of
the
american
people
,
there
is
much
progress
to
report
.
after
a
decade
of
grinding
war
,
our
brave
men
and
woman
in
uniform
are
coming
home
.
after
year
of
grueling
recession
,
our
business
have
created
over
6
million
new
job
.
we
buy
more
american
car
than
we
have
in
5
year
and
le
foreign
oil
than
we
have
in
20
.
our
housing
market
is
healing
,
our
stock
market
is
rebounding
,
and
consumer
,
patient
,
and
homeowner
enjoy
stronger
protection
than
ever
before
.
so
together
,
we
have
cleared
away
the
rubble
of
crisis
,
and
we
can
say
with
renewed
confidence
that
the
state
of
our
union
is
stronger
.
but
we
gather
here
knowing
that
there
are
million
of
american
whose
hard
work
and
dedication
have
not
yet
been
rewarded
.
our
economy
is
adding
job
,
but
too
many
people
still
ca
n't
find
full-time
employment
.
corporate
profit
have
skyrocketed
to
alltime
high
,
but
for
more
than
a
decade
,
wage
and
income
have
barely
budged
.
it
is
our
generation
's
task
,
then
,
to
reignite
the
true
engine
of
america
's
economic
growth
:
a
rising
,
thriving
middle
class
.
it
is
our
unfinished
task
to
restore
the
basic
bargain
that
built
this
country
:
the
idea
that
if
you
work
hard
and
meet
your
responsibility
,
you
can
get
ahead
,
no
matter
where
you
come
from
,
no
matter
what
you
look
like
or
who
you
love
.
it
is
our
unfinished
task
to
make
sure
that
this
government
work
on
behalf
of
the
many
,
and
not
just
the
few
;
that
it
encourages
free
enterprise
,
reward
individual
initiative
,
and
open
the
door
of
opportunity
to
every
child
across
this
great
nation
.
the
american
people
do
n't
expect
government
to
solve
every
problem
.
they
do
n't
expect
those
of
u
in
this
chamber
to
agree
on
every
issue
.
but
they
do
expect
u
to
put
the
nation
's
interest
before
party
.
they
do
expect
u
to
forge
reasonable
compromise
where
we
can
.
for
they
know
that
america
move
forward
only
when
we
do
so
together
and
that
the
responsibility
of
improving
this
union
remains
the
task
of
u
all
.
now
,
our
work
must
begin
by
making
some
basic
decision
about
our
budget
,
decision
that
will
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
strength
of
our
recovery
.
over
the
last
few
year
,
both
party
have
worked
together
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
$
2.5
trillion
,
mostly
through
spending
cut
,
but
also
by
raising
tax
rate
on
the
wealthiest
1
percent
of
american
.
a
a
result
,
we
are
more
than
halfway
towards
the
goal
of
$
4
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
that
economist
say
we
need
to
stabilize
our
finance
.
now
we
need
to
finish
the
job
.
and
the
question
is
,
how
?
in
2011
,
congress
passed
a
law
saying
that
if
both
party
could
n't
agree
on
a
plan
to
reach
our
deficit
goal
,
about
a
trillion
dollar
'
worth
of
budget
cut
would
automatically
go
into
effect
this
year
.
these
sudden
,
harsh
,
arbitrary
cut
would
jeopardize
our
military
readiness
.
they
'd
devastate
priority
like
education
and
energy
and
medical
research
.
they
would
certainly
slow
our
recovery
and
cost
u
hundred
of
thousand
of
job
.
and
that
's
why
democrat
,
republican
,
business
leader
,
and
economist
have
already
said
that
these
cuts—known
here
in
washington
a
the
sequester—are
a
really
bad
idea
.
now
,
some
in
congress
have
proposed
preventing
only
the
defense
cut
by
making
even
bigger
cut
to
thing
like
education
and
job
training
,
medicare
,
and
social
security
benefit
.
that
idea
is
even
worse
.
yes
,
the
biggest
driver
of
our
long-term
debt
is
the
rising
cost
of
health
care
for
an
aging
population
.
and
those
of
u
who
care
deeply
about
program
like
medicare
must
embrace
the
need
for
modest
reform
;
otherwise
,
our
retirement
program
will
crowd
out
the
investment
we
need
for
our
child
and
jeopardize
the
promise
of
a
secure
retirement
for
future
generation
.
but
we
ca
n't
ask
senior
citizen
and
working
family
to
shoulder
the
entire
burden
of
deficit
reduction
while
asking
nothing
more
from
the
wealthiest
and
the
most
powerful
.
we
wo
n't
grow
the
middle
class
simply
by
shifting
the
cost
of
health
care
or
college
onto
family
that
are
already
struggling
or
by
forcing
community
to
lay
off
more
teacher
and
more
cop
and
more
firefighter
.
most
americans—democrats
,
republican
,
and
independents—understand
that
we
ca
n't
just
cut
our
way
to
prosperity
.
they
know
that
broad-based
economic
growth
requires
a
balanced
approach
to
deficit
reduction
,
with
spending
cut
and
revenue
and
with
everybody
doing
their
fair
share
.
and
that
's
the
approach
i
offer
tonight
.
on
medicare
,
i
'm
prepared
to
enact
reform
that
will
achieve
the
same
amount
of
health
care
saving
by
the
beginning
of
the
next
decade
a
the
reform
proposed
by
the
bipartisan
simpson-bowles
commission
.
already
,
the
affordable
care
act
is
helping
to
slow
the
growth
of
health
care
cost
.
and
the
reform
i
'm
proposing
go
even
further
.
we
'll
reduce
taxpayer
subsidy
to
prescription
drug
company
and
ask
more
from
the
wealthiest
senior
.
we
'll
bring
down
cost
by
changing
the
way
our
government
pay
for
medicare
,
because
our
medical
bill
should
n't
be
based
on
the
number
of
test
ordered
or
day
spent
in
the
hospital
;
they
should
be
based
on
the
quality
of
care
that
our
senior
receive
.
and
i
am
open
to
additional
reform
from
both
party
,
so
long
a
they
do
n't
violate
the
guarantee
of
a
secure
retirement
.
our
government
should
n't
make
promise
we
can
not
keep
,
but
we
must
keep
the
promise
we
've
already
made
.
to
hit
the
rest
of
our
deficit
reduction
target
,
we
should
do
what
leader
in
both
party
have
already
suggested
and
save
hundred
of
billion
of
dollar
by
getting
rid
of
tax
loophole
and
deduction
for
the
well-off
and
the
well-connected
.
after
all
,
why
would
we
choose
to
make
deeper
cut
to
education
and
medicare
just
to
protect
special
interest
tax
break
?
how
is
that
fair
?
why
is
it
that
deficit
reduction
is
a
big
emergency
justifying
making
cut
in
social
security
benefit
,
but
not
closing
some
loophole
?
how
doe
that
promote
growth
?
now
is
our
best
chance
for
bipartisan
,
comprehensive
tax
reform
that
encourages
job
creation
and
help
bring
down
the
deficit
.
we
can
get
this
done
.
the
american
people
deserve
a
tax
code
that
help
small
business
spend
le
time
filling
out
complicated
form
and
more
time
expanding
and
hiring
;
a
tax
code
that
ensures
billionaire
with
high-powered
accountant
ca
n't
work
the
system
and
pay
a
lower
rate
than
their
hard-working
secretary
;
a
tax
code
that
lower
incentive
to
move
job
overseas
and
lower
tax
rate
for
business
and
manufacturer
that
are
creating
job
right
here
in
the
united
state
of
america
.
that
's
what
tax
reform
can
deliver
.
that
's
what
we
can
do
together
.
i
realize
that
tax
reform
and
entitlement
reform
will
not
be
easy
.
the
politics
will
be
hard
for
both
side
.
none
of
u
will
get
a
hundred
percent
of
what
we
want
.
but
the
alternative
will
cost
u
job
,
hurt
our
economy
,
visit
hardship
on
million
of
hard-working
american
.
so
let
's
set
party
interest
aside
and
work
to
pas
a
budget
that
replaces
reckless
cut
with
smart
saving
and
wise
investment
in
our
future
.
and
let
's
do
it
without
the
brinksmanship
that
stress
consumer
and
scare
off
investor
.
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
can
not
keep
conducting
it
business
by
drifting
from
one
manufactured
crisis
to
the
next
.
we
ca
n't
do
it
.
let
's
agree
right
here
,
right
now
to
keep
the
people
's
government
open
and
pay
our
bill
on
time
and
always
uphold
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
state
of
america
.
the
american
people
have
worked
too
hard
,
for
too
long
,
rebuilding
from
one
crisis
to
see
their
elected
official
cause
another
.
now
,
most
of
u
agree
that
a
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
must
be
part
of
our
agenda
.
but
let
's
be
clear
:
deficit
reduction
alone
is
not
an
economic
plan
.
a
growing
economy
that
creates
good
,
middle
class
job
,
that
must
be
the
north
star
that
guide
our
effort
.
every
day
,
we
should
ask
ourselves
three
question
a
a
nation
:
how
do
we
attract
more
job
to
our
shore
?
how
do
we
equip
our
people
with
the
skill
they
need
to
get
those
job
?
and
how
do
we
make
sure
that
hard
work
lead
to
a
decent
living
?
now
,
a
year
and
a
half
ago
,
i
put
forward
an
american
job
act
that
independent
economist
said
would
create
more
than
1
million
new
job
.
and
i
thank
the
last
congress
for
passing
some
of
that
agenda
.
i
urge
this
congress
to
pas
the
rest
.
but
tonight
i'll
lay
out
additional
proposal
that
are
fully
paid
for
and
fully
consistent
with
the
budget
framework
both
party
agreed
to
just
18
month
ago
.
let
me
repeat
:
nothing
i'm
proposing
tonight
should
increase
our
deficit
by
a
single
dime
.
it
is
not
a
bigger
government
we
need
,
but
a
smarter
government
that
set
priority
and
invests
in
broad-based
growth
.
that
's
what
we
should
be
looking
for
.
our
first
priority
is
making
america
a
magnet
for
new
job
and
manufacturing
.
after
shedding
job
for
more
than
10
year
,
our
manufacturer
have
added
about
500,000
job
over
the
past
3
.
caterpillar
is
bringing
job
back
from
japan
.
ford
is
bringing
job
back
from
mexico
.
and
this
year
,
apple
will
start
making
mac
in
america
again
.
there
are
thing
we
can
do
right
now
to
accelerate
this
trend
.
last
year
,
we
created
our
first
manufacturing
innovation
institute
in
youngstown
,
ohio
.
a
once-shuttered
warehouse
is
now
a
state-of-the-art
lab
where
new
worker
are
mastering
the
3-d
printing
that
ha
the
potential
to
revolutionize
the
way
we
make
almost
everything
.
there
's
no
reason
this
ca
n't
happen
in
other
town
.
so
tonight
i
'm
announcing
the
launch
of
three
more
of
these
manufacturing
hub
,
where
business
will
partner
with
the
department
of
defense
and
energy
to
turn
region
left
behind
by
globalization
into
global
center
of
high-tech
job
.
and
i
ask
this
congress
to
help
create
a
network
of
15
of
these
hub
and
guarantee
that
the
next
revolution
in
manufacturing
is
made
right
here
in
america
.
we
can
get
that
done
.
now
,
if
we
want
to
make
the
best
product
,
we
also
have
to
invest
in
the
best
idea
.
every
dollar
we
invested
to
map
the
human
genome
returned
$
140
to
our
economy—every
dollar
.
today
,
our
scientist
are
mapping
the
human
brain
to
unlock
the
answer
to
alzheimer
's
.
they
're
developing
drug
to
regenerate
damaged
organ
,
devising
new
material
to
make
battery
10
time
more
powerful
.
now
is
not
the
time
to
gut
these
job-creating
investment
in
science
and
innovation
,
now
is
the
time
to
reach
a
level
of
research
and
development
not
seen
since
the
height
of
the
space
race
.
we
need
to
make
those
investment
.
today
,
no
area
hold
more
promise
than
our
investment
in
american
energy
.
after
year
of
talking
about
it
,
we
're
finally
poised
to
control
our
own
energy
future
.
we
produce
more
oil
at
home
than
we
have
in
15
year
.
we
have
doubled
the
distance
our
car
will
go
on
a
gallon
of
gas
and
the
amount
of
renewable
energy
we
generate
from
source
like
wind
and
solar
,
with
ten
of
thousand
of
good
american
job
to
show
for
it
.
we
produce
more
natural
gas
than
ever
before
,
and
nearly
everyone
's
energy
bill
is
lower
because
of
it
.
and
over
the
last
4
year
,
our
emission
of
the
dangerous
carbon
pollution
that
threatens
our
planet
have
actually
fallen
.
but
for
the
sake
of
our
child
and
our
future
,
we
must
do
more
to
combat
climate
change
.
now
,
it
's
true
that
no
single
event
make
a
trend
.
but
the
fact
is
,
the
12
hottest
year
on
record
have
all
come
in
the
last
15
.
heat
wave
,
drought
,
wildfire
,
floods—all
are
now
more
frequent
and
more
intense
.
we
can
choose
to
believe
that
superstorm
sandy
and
the
most
severe
drought
in
decade
and
the
worst
wildfire
some
state
have
ever
seen
were
all
just
a
freak
coincidence
.
or
we
can
choose
to
believe
in
the
overwhelming
judgment
of
science
and
act
before
it
's
too
late
.
now
,
the
good
news
is
we
can
make
meaningful
progress
on
this
issue
while
driving
strong
economic
growth
.
i
urge
this
congress
to
get
together
,
pursue
a
bipartisan
,
market-based
solution
to
climate
change
,
like
the
one
john
mccain
and
joe
lieberman
worked
on
together
a
few
year
ago
.
but
if
congress
wo
n't
act
soon
to
protect
future
generation
,
i
will
.
i
will
direct
my
cabinet
to
come
up
with
executive
action
we
can
take
,
now
and
in
the
future
,
to
reduce
pollution
,
prepare
our
community
for
the
consequence
of
climate
change
,
and
speed
the
transition
to
more
sustainable
source
of
energy
.
and
4
year
ago
,
other
country
dominated
the
clean
energy
market
and
the
job
that
came
with
it
.
and
we
've
begun
to
change
that
.
last
year
,
wind
energy
added
nearly
half
of
all
new
power
capacity
in
america
.
so
let
's
generate
even
more
.
solar
energy
get
cheaper
by
the
year
;
let
's
drive
down
cost
even
further
.
a
long
a
country
like
china
keep
going
all
in
on
clean
energy
,
so
must
we
.
now
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
natural
gas
boom
ha
led
to
cleaner
power
and
greater
energy
independence
.
we
need
to
encourage
that
.
and
that
's
why
my
administration
will
keep
cutting
redtape
and
speeding
up
new
oil
and
gas
permit
.
that
's
got
to
be
part
of
an
all-of-the-above
plan
.
but
i
also
want
to
work
with
this
congress
to
encourage
the
research
and
technology
that
help
natural
gas
burn
even
cleaner
and
protects
our
air
and
our
water
.
in
fact
,
much
of
our
new-found
energy
is
drawn
from
land
and
water
that
we
,
the
public
,
own
together
.
so
tonight
i
propose
we
use
some
of
our
oil
and
gas
revenue
to
fund
an
energy
security
trust
that
will
drive
new
research
and
technology
to
shift
our
car
and
truck
off
oil
for
good
.
if
a
nonpartisan
coalition
of
ceo
and
retired
general
and
admiral
can
get
behind
this
idea
,
then
so
can
we
.
let
's
take
their
advice
and
free
our
family
and
business
from
the
painful
spike
in
gas
price
we
've
put
up
with
for
far
too
long
.
i
'm
also
issuing
a
new
goal
for
america
:
let
's
cut
in
half
the
energy
wasted
by
our
home
and
business
over
the
next
20
year
.
we
'll
work
with
the
state
to
do
it
.
those
state
with
the
best
idea
to
create
job
and
lower
energy
bill
by
constructing
more
efficient
building
will
receive
federal
support
to
help
make
that
happen
.
america
's
energy
sector
is
just
one
part
of
an
aging
infrastructure
badly
in
need
of
repair
.
ask
any
ceo
where
they
'd
rather
locate
and
hire
,
a
country
with
deteriorating
road
and
bridge
or
one
with
high-speed
rail
and
internet
,
high-tech
school
,
self-healing
power
grid
.
the
ceo
of
siemens
america—a
company
that
brought
hundred
of
new
job
to
north
carolina—said
that
if
we
upgrade
our
infrastructure
,
they
'll
bring
even
more
job
.
and
that
's
the
attitude
of
a
lot
of
company
all
around
the
world
.
and
i
know
you
want
these
job-creating
project
in
your
district
.
i
've
seen
all
those
ribbon-cuttings
.
[
laughter
]
so
tonight
i
propose
a
fix-it-first
program
to
put
people
to
work
a
soon
a
possible
on
our
most
urgent
repair
,
like
the
nearly
70,000
structurally
deficient
bridge
across
the
country
.
and
to
make
sure
taxpayer
do
n't
shoulder
the
whole
burden
,
i
'm
also
proposing
a
partnership
to
rebuild
america
that
attracts
private
capital
to
upgrade
what
our
business
need
most
:
modern
port
to
move
our
good
,
modern
pipeline
to
withstand
a
storm
,
modern
school
worthy
of
our
child
.
let
's
prove
there
's
no
better
place
to
do
business
than
here
in
the
united
state
of
america
,
and
let
's
start
right
away
.
we
can
get
this
done
.
and
part
of
our
rebuilding
effort
must
also
involve
our
housing
sector
.
the
good
news
is
,
our
housing
market
is
finally
healing
from
the
collapse
of
2007
.
home
price
are
rising
at
the
fastest
pace
in
6
year
.
home
purchase
are
up
nearly
50
percent
,
and
construction
is
expanding
again
.
but
even
with
mortgage
rate
near
a
50-year
low
,
too
many
family
with
solid
credit
who
want
to
buy
a
home
are
being
rejected
.
too
many
family
who
never
missed
a
payment
and
want
to
refinance
are
being
told
no
.
that
's
holding
our
entire
economy
back
.
we
need
to
fix
it
.
right
now
there
's
a
bill
in
this
congress
that
would
give
every
responsible
homeowner
in
america
the
chance
to
save
$
3,000
a
year
by
refinancing
at
today
's
rate
.
democrat
and
republican
have
supported
it
before
,
so
what
are
we
waiting
for
?
take
a
vote
and
send
me
that
bill
.
why
are—why
would
we
be
against
that
?
why
would
that
be
a
partisan
issue
,
helping
folk
refinance
?
right
now
overlapping
regulation
keep
responsible
young
family
from
buying
their
first
home
.
what
's
holding
u
back
?
let
's
streamline
the
process
and
help
our
economy
grow
.
these
initiative
in
manufacturing
,
energy
,
infrastructure
,
housing
,
all
these
thing
will
help
entrepreneur
and
small-business
owner
expand
and
create
new
job
.
but
none
of
it
will
matter
unless
we
also
equip
our
citizen
with
the
skill
and
training
to
fill
those
job
.
and
that
ha
to
start
at
the
earliest
possible
age
.
study
after
study
show
that
the
sooner
a
child
begin
learning
,
the
better
he
or
she
doe
down
the
road
.
but
today
,
fewer
than
3
in
10
4-year-olds
are
enrolled
in
a
high-quality
preschool
program
.
most
middle
class
parent
ca
n't
afford
a
few
hundred
buck
a
week
for
a
private
preschool
.
and
for
poor
kid
who
need
help
the
most
,
this
lack
of
access
to
preschool
education
can
shadow
them
for
the
rest
of
their
life
.
so
tonight
i
propose
working
with
state
to
make
high-quality
preschool
available
to
every
single
child
in
america
.
that
's
something
we
should
be
able
to
do
.
every
dollar
we
invest
in
high-quality
early
childhood
education
can
save
more
than
7
dollar
later
on
:
by
boosting
graduation
rate
,
reducing
teen
pregnancy
,
even
reducing
violent
crime
.
in
state
that
make
it
a
priority
to
educate
our
youngest
child
,
like
georgia
or
oklahoma
,
study
show
student
grow
up
more
likely
to
read
and
do
math
at
grade
level
,
graduate
high
school
,
hold
a
job
,
form
more
stable
family
of
their
own
.
we
know
this
work
.
so
let
's
do
what
work
and
make
sure
none
of
our
child
start
the
race
of
life
already
behind
.
let
's
give
our
kid
that
chance
.
let
's
also
make
sure
that
a
high
school
diploma
put
our
kid
on
a
path
to
a
good
job
.
right
now
country
like
germany
focus
on
graduating
their
high
school
student
with
the
equivalent
of
a
technical
degree
from
one
of
our
community
college
.
so
those
german
kid
,
they
're
ready
for
a
job
when
they
graduate
high
school
.
they
've
been
trained
for
the
job
that
are
there
.
now
at
school
like
p-tech
in
brooklyn
,
a
collaboration
between
new
york
public
school
and
city
university
of
new
york
and
ibm
,
student
will
graduate
with
a
high
school
diploma
and
an
associate
's
degree
in
computer
or
engineering
.
we
need
to
give
every
american
student
opportunity
like
this
.
and
4
year
ago
,
we
started
race
to
the
top
,
a
competition
that
convinced
almost
every
state
to
develop
smarter
curriculum
and
higher
standard
,
all
for
about
1
percent
of
what
we
spend
on
education
each
year
.
tonight
i
'm
announcing
a
new
challenge
to
redesign
america
's
high
school
so
they
better
equip
graduate
for
the
demand
of
a
high-tech
economy
.
and
we
'll
reward
school
that
develop
new
partnership
with
college
and
employer
and
create
class
that
focus
on
science
,
technology
,
engineering
,
and
math
:
the
skill
today
's
employer
are
looking
for
to
fill
the
job
that
are
there
right
now
and
will
be
there
in
the
future
.
now
,
even
with
better
high
school
,
most
young
people
will
need
some
higher
education
.
it
's
a
simple
fact
:
the
more
education
you
've
got
,
the
more
likely
you
are
to
have
a
good
job
and
work
your
way
into
the
middle
class
.
but
today
,
skyrocketing
cost
price
too
many
young
people
out
of
a
higher
education
or
saddle
them
with
unsustainable
debt
.
through
tax
credit
,
grant
,
and
better
loan
,
we
've
made
college
more
affordable
for
million
of
student
and
family
over
the
last
few
year
.
but
taxpayer
ca
n't
keep
on
subsidizing
higher
and
higher
and
higher
cost
for
higher
education
.
college
must
do
their
part
to
keep
cost
down
,
and
it
's
our
job
to
make
sure
that
they
do
.
so
tonight
i
ask
congress
to
change
the
higher
education
act
so
that
affordability
and
value
are
included
in
determining
which
college
receive
certain
type
of
federal
aid
.
and
tomorrow
my
administration
will
release
a
new
college
scorecard
that
parent
and
student
can
use
to
compare
school
based
on
a
simple
criterion
:
where
you
can
get
the
most
bang
for
your
educational
buck
.
now
,
to
grow
our
middle
class
,
our
citizen
have
to
have
access
to
the
education
and
training
that
today
's
job
require
.
but
we
also
have
to
make
sure
that
america
remains
a
place
where
everyone
who
's
willing
to
work—everybody
who
's
willing
to
work
hard—has
the
chance
to
get
ahead
.
our
economy
is
stronger
when
we
harness
the
talent
and
ingenuity
of
striving
,
hopeful
immigrant
.
and
right
now
leader
from
the
business
,
labor
,
law
enforcement
,
faith
community
,
they
all
agree
that
the
time
ha
come
to
pas
comprehensive
immigration
reform
.
now
is
the
time
to
do
it
.
now
is
the
time
to
get
it
done
.
[
applause
]
now
is
the
time
to
get
it
done
.
real
reform
mean
stronger
border
security
,
and
we
can
build
on
the
progress
my
administration
ha
already
made
:
putting
more
boot
on
the
southern
border
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
and
reducing
illegal
crossing
to
their
lowest
level
in
40
year
.
real
reform
mean
establishing
a
responsible
pathway
to
earned
citizenship
,
a
path
that
includes
passing
a
background
check
,
paying
tax
and
a
meaningful
penalty
,
learning
english
,
and
going
to
the
back
of
the
line
behind
the
folk
trying
to
come
here
legally
.
and
real
reform
mean
fixing
the
legal
immigration
system
to
cut
waiting
period
and
attract
the
highly
skilled
entrepreneur
and
engineer
that
will
help
create
job
and
grow
our
economy
.
in
other
word
,
we
know
what
need
to
be
done
.
and
a
we
speak
,
bipartisan
group
in
both
chamber
are
working
diligently
to
draft
a
bill
,
and
i
applaud
their
effort
.
so
let's
get
this
done
.
send
me
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill
in
the
next
few
month
,
and
i
will
sign
it
right
away
.
and
america
will
be
better
for
it
.
let
's
get
it
done
.
[
applause
]
let
's
get
it
done
.
but
we
ca
n't
stop
there
.
we
know
our
economy
is
stronger
when
our
wife
,
our
mother
,
our
daughter
can
live
their
life
free
from
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
free
from
the
fear
of
domestic
violence
.
today
the
senate
passed
the
``
violence
against
women's
act
''
that
joe
biden
originally
wrote
almost
20
year
ago
.
and
i
now
urge
the
house
to
do
the
same
.
good
job
,
joe
.
and
i
ask
this
congress
to
declare
that
woman
should
earn
a
living
equal
to
their
effort
,
and
finally
pas
the
``
paycheck
fairness
act
''
this
year
.
we
know
our
economy
is
stronger
when
we
reward
an
honest
day
's
work
with
honest
wage
.
but
today
,
a
full-time
worker
making
the
minimum
wage
earns
$
14,500
a
year
.
even
with
the
tax
relief
we
put
in
place
,
a
family
with
two
kid
that
earns
the
minimum
wage
still
life
below
the
poverty
line
.
that
's
wrong
.
that
's
why
,
since
the
last
time
this
congress
raised
the
minimum
wage
,
19
state
have
chosen
to
bump
theirs
even
higher
.
tonight
let
's
declare
that
in
the
wealthiest
nation
on
earth
,
no
one
who
work
full-time
should
have
to
live
in
poverty
and
raise
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
$
9
an
hour
.
we
should
be
able
to
get
that
done
.
this
single
step
would
raise
the
income
of
million
of
working
family
.
it
could
mean
the
difference
between
grocery
or
the
food
bank
,
rent
or
eviction
,
scraping
by
or
finally
getting
ahead
.
for
business
across
the
country
,
it
would
mean
customer
with
more
money
in
their
pocket
.
and
a
whole
lot
of
folk
out
there
would
probably
need
le
help
from
government
.
in
fact
,
working
folk
should
n't
have
to
wait
year
after
year
for
the
minimum
wage
to
go
up
while
ceo
pay
ha
never
been
higher
.
so
here
's
an
idea
that
governor
romney
and
i
actually
agreed
on
last
year
:
let
's
tie
the
minimum
wage
to
the
cost
of
living
so
that
it
finally
becomes
a
wage
you
can
live
on
.
tonight
let
's
also
recognize
that
there
are
community
in
this
country
where
no
matter
how
hard
you
work
,
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
get
ahead
:
factory
town
decimated
from
year
of
plant
packing
up
;
inescapable
pocket
of
poverty
,
urban
and
rural
,
where
young
adult
are
still
fighting
for
their
first
job
.
america
is
not
a
place
where
the
chance
of
birth
or
circumstance
should
decide
our
destiny
.
and
that
's
why
we
need
to
build
new
ladder
of
opportunity
into
the
middle
class
for
all
who
are
willing
to
climb
them
.
let
's
offer
incentive
to
company
that
hire
american
who
've
got
what
it
take
to
fill
that
job
opening
,
but
have
been
out
of
work
so
long
that
no
one
will
give
them
a
chance
anymore
.
let
's
put
people
back
to
work
rebuilding
vacant
home
in
rundown
neighborhood
.
and
this
year
,
my
administration
will
begin
to
partner
with
20
of
the
hardest
hit
town
in
america
to
get
these
community
back
on
their
foot
.
now
,
we
'll
work
with
local
leader
to
target
resource
at
public
safety
and
education
and
housing
.
we
'll
give
new
tax
credit
to
business
that
hire
and
invest
.
and
we
'll
work
to
strengthen
family
by
removing
the
financial
deterrent
to
marriage
for
low-income
couple
and
do
more
to
encourage
fatherhood
,
because
what
make
you
a
man
is
n't
the
ability
to
conceive
a
child
,
it
's
having
the
courage
to
raise
one
.
and
we
want
to
encourage
that
.
we
want
to
help
that
.
stronger
family
.
stronger
community
.
a
stronger
america
.
it
is
this
kind
of
prosperity—broad
,
shared
,
built
on
a
thriving
middle
class—that
ha
always
been
the
source
of
our
progress
at
home
.
it
's
also
the
foundation
of
our
power
and
influence
throughout
the
world
.
tonight
we
stand
united
in
saluting
the
troop
and
civilian
who
sacrifice
every
day
to
protect
u
.
because
of
them
,
we
can
say
with
confidence
that
america
will
complete
it
mission
in
afghanistan
and
achieve
our
objective
of
defeating
the
core
of
al
qaida
.
already
,
we
have
brought
home
33,000
of
our
brave
service
men
and
woman
.
this
spring
,
our
force
will
move
into
a
support
role
,
while
afghan
security
force
take
the
lead
.
tonight
i
can
announce
that
over
the
next
year
,
another
34,000
american
troop
will
come
home
from
afghanistan
.
this
drawdown
will
continue
,
and
by
the
end
of
next
year
,
our
war
in
afghanistan
will
be
over
.
beyond
2014
,
america
's
commitment
to
a
unified
and
sovereign
afghanistan
will
endure
,
but
the
nature
of
our
commitment
will
change
.
we
're
negotiating
an
agreement
with
the
afghan
government
that
focus
on
two
mission
:
training
and
equipping
afghan
force
so
that
the
country
doe
not
again
slip
into
chaos
and
counterterrorism
effort
that
allow
u
to
pursue
the
remnant
of
al
qaida
and
their
affiliate
.
today
,
the
organization
that
attacked
u
on
9/11
is
a
shadow
of
it
former
self
.
it's
true
,
different
al
qaida
affiliate
and
extremist
group
have
emerged
,
from
the
arabian
peninsula
to
africa
.
the
threat
these
group
pose
is
evolving
.
but
to
meet
this
threat
,
we
do
n't
need
to
send
ten
of
thousand
of
our
son
and
daughter
abroad
or
occupy
other
nation
.
instead
,
we
'll
need
to
help
country
like
yemen
and
libya
and
somalia
provide
for
their
own
security
and
help
ally
who
take
the
fight
to
terrorist
,
a
we
have
in
mali
.
and
where
necessary
,
through
a
range
of
capability
,
we
will
continue
to
take
direct
action
against
those
terrorist
who
pose
the
gravest
threat
to
american
.
now
,
a
we
do
,
we
must
enlist
our
value
in
the
fight
.
that
's
why
my
administration
ha
worked
tirelessly
to
forge
a
durable
legal
and
policy
framework
to
guide
our
counterterrorism
effort
.
throughout
,
we
have
kept
congress
fully
informed
of
our
effort
.
i
recognize
that
in
our
democracy
,
no
one
should
just
take
my
word
for
it
that
we
're
doing
thing
the
right
way
.
so
,
in
the
month
ahead
,
i
will
continue
to
engage
congress
to
ensure
not
only
that
our
targeting
,
detention
,
and
prosecution
of
terrorist
remains
consistent
with
our
law
and
system
of
check
and
balance
,
but
that
our
effort
are
even
more
transparent
to
the
american
people
and
to
the
world
.
of
course
,
our
challenge
do
n't
end
with
al
qaida
.
america
will
continue
to
lead
the
effort
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
world
's
most
dangerous
weapon
.
the
regime
in
north
korea
must
know
they
will
only
achieve
security
and
prosperity
by
meeting
their
international
obligation
.
provocation
of
the
sort
we
saw
last
night
will
only
further
isolate
them
,
a
we
stand
by
our
ally
,
strengthen
our
own
missile
defense
,
and
lead
the
world
in
taking
firm
action
in
response
to
these
threat
.
likewise
,
the
leader
of
iran
must
recognize
that
now
is
the
time
for
a
diplomatic
solution
,
because
a
coalition
stand
united
in
demanding
that
they
meet
their
obligation
,
and
we
will
do
what
is
necessary
to
prevent
them
from
getting
a
nuclear
weapon
.
at
the
same
time
,
we
'll
engage
russia
to
seek
further
reduction
in
our
nuclear
arsenal
and
continue
leading
the
global
effort
to
secure
nuclear
material
that
could
fall
into
the
wrong
hand
,
because
our
ability
to
influence
others
depends
on
our
willingness
to
lead
and
meet
our
obligation
.
america
must
also
face
the
rapidly
growing
threat
from
cyber
attack
.
now
,
we
know
hacker
steal
people
's
identity
and
infiltrate
private
e-mail
.
we
know
foreign
country
and
company
swipe
our
corporate
secret
.
now
our
enemy
are
also
seeking
the
ability
to
sabotage
our
power
grid
,
our
financial
institution
,
our
air
traffic
control
system
.
we
can
not
look
back
year
from
now
and
wonder
why
we
did
nothing
in
the
face
of
real
threat
to
our
security
and
our
economy
.
and
that
's
why
,
earlier
today
,
i
signed
a
new
executive
order
that
will
strengthen
our
cyber
defense
by
increasing
information
sharing
and
developing
standard
to
protect
our
national
security
,
our
job
,
and
our
privacy
.
but
now
congress
must
act
a
well
,
by
passing
legislation
to
give
our
government
a
greater
capacity
to
secure
our
network
and
deter
attack
.
this
is
something
we
should
be
able
to
get
done
on
a
bipartisan
basis
.
now
,
even
a
we
protect
our
people
,
we
should
remember
that
today
's
world
present
not
just
danger
,
not
just
threat
,
it
present
opportunity
.
to
boost
american
export
,
support
american
job
and
level
the
playing
field
in
the
growing
market
of
asia
,
we
intend
to
complete
negotiation
on
a
trans-pacific
partnership
.
and
tonight
i'm
announcing
that
we
will
launch
talk
on
a
comprehensive
transatlantic
trade
and
investment
partnership
with
the
european
union
,
because
trade
that
is
fair
and
free
across
the
atlantic
support
million
of
good-paying
american
job
.
we
also
know
that
progress
in
the
most
impoverished
part
of
our
world
enriches
u
all
,
not
only
because
it
creates
new
market
,
more
stable
order
in
certain
region
of
the
world
,
but
also
because
it
's
the
right
thing
to
do
.
in
many
place
,
people
live
on
little
more
than
a
dollar
a
day
.
so
the
united
state
will
join
with
our
ally
to
eradicate
such
extreme
poverty
in
the
next
two
decade
by
connecting
more
people
to
the
global
economy
,
by
empowering
woman
,
by
giving
our
young
and
brightest
mind
new
opportunity
to
serve
and
helping
community
to
feed
and
power
and
educate
themselves
,
by
saving
the
world
's
child
from
preventable
death
,
and
by
realizing
the
promise
of
an
aids-free
generation
,
which
is
within
our
reach
.
you
see
,
america
must
remain
a
beacon
to
all
who
seek
freedom
during
this
period
of
historic
change
.
i
saw
the
power
of
hope
last
year
in
rangoon
,
in
burma
,
when
aung
san
suu
kyi
welcomed
an
american
president
into
the
home
where
she
had
been
imprisoned
for
year
;
when
thousand
of
burmese
lined
the
street
,
waving
american
flag
,
including
a
man
who
said
:
``
there
is
justice
and
law
in
the
united
state
.
i
want
our
country
to
be
like
that
.
''
in
defense
of
freedom
,
we
'll
remain
the
anchor
of
strong
alliance
from
the
america
to
africa
,
from
europe
to
asia
.
in
the
middle
east
,
we
will
stand
with
citizen
a
they
demand
their
universal
right
and
support
stable
transition
to
democracy
.
we
know
the
process
will
be
messy
,
and
we
can
not
presume
to
dictate
the
course
of
change
in
country
like
egypt
,
but
we
can
and
will
insist
on
respect
for
the
fundamental
right
of
all
people
.
we
'll
keep
the
pressure
on
a
syrian
regime
that
ha
murdered
it
own
people
and
support
opposition
leader
that
respect
the
right
of
every
syrian
.
and
we
will
stand
steadfast
with
israel
in
pursuit
of
security
and
a
lasting
peace
.
these
are
the
message
i
'll
deliver
when
i
travel
to
the
middle
east
next
month
.
and
all
this
work
depends
on
the
courage
and
sacrifice
of
those
who
serve
in
dangerous
place
at
great
personal
risk
:
our
diplomat
,
our
intelligence
officer
,
and
the
men
and
woman
of
the
united
state
armed
force
.
a
long
a
i
'm
commander
in
chief
,
we
will
do
whatever
we
must
to
protect
those
who
serve
their
country
abroad
,
and
we
will
maintain
the
best
military
the
world
ha
ever
known
.
we
'll
invest
in
new
capability
,
even
a
we
reduce
waste
and
wartime
spending
.
we
will
ensure
equal
treatment
for
all
servicemembers
and
equal
benefit
for
their
family
,
gay
and
straight
.
we
will
draw
upon
the
courage
and
skill
of
our
sister
and
daughter
and
mom
,
because
woman
have
proven
under
fire
that
they
are
ready
for
combat
.
we
will
keep
faith
with
our
veteran
,
investing
in
world-class
care—including
mental
health
care—for
our
wounded
warrior
,
supporting
our
military
family
,
giving
our
veteran
the
benefit
and
education
and
job
opportunity
that
they
have
earned
.
and
i
want
to
thank
my
wife
michelle
and
dr.
jill
biden
for
their
continued
dedication
to
serving
our
military
family
a
well
a
they
have
served
u
.
thank
you
,
honey
.
thank
you
,
jill
.
defending
our
freedom
,
though
,
is
not
just
the
job
of
our
military
alone
.
we
must
all
do
our
part
to
make
sure
our
god-given
right
are
protected
here
at
home
.
that
includes
one
of
the
most
fundamental
right
of
a
democracy
:
the
right
to
vote
.
now
,
when
any
american
,
no
matter
where
they
live
or
what
their
party
,
are
denied
that
right
because
they
ca
n't
afford
to
wait
for
5
or
6
or
7
hour
just
to
cast
their
ballot
,
we
are
betraying
our
ideal
.
so
tonight
i
'm
announcing
a
nonpartisan
commission
to
improve
the
voting
experience
in
america
.
and
it
definitely
need
improvement
.
i
'm
asking
two
long-time
expert
in
the
field—who
,
by
the
way
,
recently
served
a
the
top
attorney
for
my
campaign
and
for
governor
romney
's
campaign—to
lead
it
.
we
can
fix
this
,
and
we
will
.
the
american
people
demand
it
,
and
so
doe
our
democracy
.
of
course
,
what
i
've
said
tonight
matter
little
if
we
do
n't
come
together
to
protect
our
most
precious
resource
:
our
child
.
it
ha
been
2
month
since
newtown
.
i
know
this
is
not
the
first
time
this
country
ha
debated
how
to
reduce
gun
violence
.
but
this
time
is
different
.
overwhelming
majority
of
americans—americans
who
believe
in
the
second
amendment—have
come
together
around
commonsense
reform
,
like
background
check
that
will
make
it
harder
for
criminal
to
get
their
hand
on
a
gun
.
senator
of
both
party
are
working
together
on
tough
new
law
to
prevent
anyone
from
buying
gun
for
resale
to
criminal
.
police
chief
are
asking
our
help
to
get
weapon
of
war
and
massive
ammunition
magazine
off
our
street
,
because
these
police
chief
,
they
're
tired
of
seeing
their
guy
and
gal
being
outgunned
.
each
of
these
proposal
deserves
a
vote
in
congress
.
now
,
if
you
want
to
vote
no
,
that's
your
choice
.
but
these
proposal
deserve
a
vote
.
because
in
the
2
month
since
newtown
,
more
than
a
thousand
birthday
,
graduation
,
anniversary
have
been
stolen
from
our
life
by
a
bullet
from
a
gun—more
than
a
thousand
.
one
of
those
we
lost
wa
a
young
girl
named
hadiya
pendleton
.
she
wa
15
year
old
.
she
loved
fig
newton
and
lip
gloss
.
she
wa
a
majorette
.
she
wa
so
good
to
her
friend
,
they
all
thought
they
were
her
best
friend
.
just
3
week
ago
,
she
wa
here
,
in
washington
,
with
her
classmate
,
performing
for
her
country
at
my
inauguration
.
and
a
week
later
,
she
wa
shot
and
killed
in
a
chicago
park
after
school
,
just
a
mile
away
from
my
house
.
hadiya
's
parent
,
nate
and
cleo
,
are
in
this
chamber
tonight
,
along
with
more
than
two
dozen
american
whose
life
have
been
torn
apart
by
gun
violence
.
they
deserve
a
vote
.
they
deserve
a
vote
.
[
applause
]
they
deserve
a
vote
.
gabby
giffords
deserves
a
vote
.
the
family
of
newtown
deserve
a
vote
.
the
family
of
aurora
deserve
a
vote
.
the
family
of
oak
creek
and
tucson
and
blacksburg
,
and
the
countless
other
community
ripped
open
by
gun
violence
,
they
deserve
a
simple
vote
.
they
deserve
a
simple
vote
.
our
action
will
not
prevent
every
senseless
act
of
violence
in
this
country
.
in
fact
,
no
law
,
no
initiative
,
no
administrative
act
will
perfectly
solve
all
the
challenge
i
've
outlined
tonight
.
but
we
were
never
sent
here
to
be
perfect
.
we
were
sent
here
to
make
what
difference
we
can
,
to
secure
this
nation
,
expand
opportunity
,
uphold
our
ideal
through
the
hard
,
often
frustrating
,
but
absolutely
necessary
work
of
self-government
.
we
were
sent
here
to
look
out
for
our
fellow
american
the
same
way
they
look
out
for
one
another
,
every
single
day
,
usually
without
fanfare
,
all
across
this
country
.
we
should
follow
their
example
.
we
should
follow
the
example
of
a
new
york
city
nurse
named
menchu
sanchez
.
when
hurricane
sandy
plunged
her
hospital
into
darkness
,
she
wa
n't
thinking
about
how
her
own
home
wa
faring
.
her
mind
wa
on
the
20
precious
newborn
in
her
care
and
the
rescue
plan
she
devised
that
kept
them
all
safe
.
we
should
follow
the
example
of
a
north
miami
woman
named
desiline
victor
.
when
desiline
arrived
at
her
polling
place
,
she
wa
told
the
wait
to
vote
might
be
6
hour
.
and
a
time
ticked
by
,
her
concern
wa
not
with
her
tired
body
or
aching
foot
,
but
whether
folk
like
her
would
get
to
have
their
say
.
and
hour
after
hour
,
a
throng
of
people
stayed
in
line
to
support
her
,
because
desiline
is
102
year
old
.
and
they
erupted
in
cheer
when
she
finally
put
on
a
sticker
that
read
,
``
i
voted
.
''
[
applause
]
there's
desiline
.
we
should
follow
the
example
of
a
police
officer
named
brian
murphy
.
when
a
gunman
opened
fire
on
a
sikh
temple
in
wisconsin
and
brian
wa
the
first
to
arrive—and
he
did
not
consider
his
own
safety
.
he
fought
back
until
help
arrived
and
ordered
his
fellow
officer
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
american
worshiping
inside
,
even
a
he
lay
bleeding
from
12
bullet
wound
.
and
when
asked
how
he
did
that
,
brian
said
,
``
that
's
just
the
way
we
're
made
.
''
that
's
just
the
way
we
're
made
.
we
may
do
different
job
and
wear
different
uniform
and
hold
different
view
than
the
person
beside
u
.
but
a
american
,
we
all
share
the
same
proud
title
:
we
are
citizen
.
it
's
a
word
that
doe
n't
just
describe
our
nationality
or
legal
status
.
it
describes
the
way
we
're
made
.
it
describes
what
we
believe
.
it
capture
the
enduring
idea
that
this
country
only
work
when
we
accept
certain
obligation
to
one
another
and
to
future
generation
;
that
our
right
are
wrapped
up
in
the
right
of
others
;
and
that
well
into
our
third
century
a
a
nation
,
it
remains
the
task
of
u
all
,
a
citizen
of
these
united
state
,
to
be
the
author
of
the
next
great
chapter
of
our
american
story
.
thank
you
.
god
bless
you
,
and
god
bless
these
united
state
of
america
.
