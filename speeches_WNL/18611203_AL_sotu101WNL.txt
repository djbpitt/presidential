fellow-citizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representative
:
in
the
midst
of
unprecedented
political
trouble
we
have
cause
of
great
gratitude
to
god
for
unusual
good
health
and
most
abundant
harvest
.
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
in
the
peculiar
exigency
of
the
time
our
intercourse
with
foreign
nation
ha
been
attended
with
profound
solicitude
,
chiefly
turning
upon
our
own
domestic
affair
.
a
disloyal
portion
of
the
american
people
have
during
the
whole
year
been
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
divide
and
destroy
the
union
.
a
nation
which
endures
factious
domestic
division
is
exposed
to
disrespect
abroad
,
and
one
party
,
if
not
both
,
is
sure
sooner
or
later
to
invoke
foreign
intervention
.
nation
thus
tempted
to
interfere
are
not
always
able
to
resist
the
counsel
of
seeming
expediency
and
ungenerous
ambition
,
although
measure
adopted
under
such
influence
seldom
fail
to
be
unfortunate
and
injurious
to
those
adopting
them
.
the
disloyal
citizen
of
the
united
state
who
have
offered
the
ruin
of
our
country
in
return
for
the
aid
and
comfort
which
they
have
invoked
abroad
have
received
le
patronage
and
encouragement
than
they
probably
expected
.
if
it
were
just
to
suppose
,
a
the
insurgent
have
seemed
to
assume
,
that
foreign
nation
in
this
case
,
discarding
all
moral
,
social
,
and
treaty
obligation
,
would
act
solely
and
selfishly
for
the
most
speedy
restoration
of
commerce
,
including
especially
the
acquisition
of
cotton
,
those
nation
appear
a
yet
not
to
have
seen
their
way
to
their
object
more
directly
or
clearly
through
the
destruction
than
through
the
preservation
of
the
union
.
if
we
could
dare
to
believe
that
foreign
nation
are
actuated
by
no
higher
principle
than
this
,
i
am
quite
sure
a
sound
argument
could
be
made
to
show
them
that
they
can
reach
their
aim
more
readily
and
easily
by
aiding
to
crush
this
rebellion
than
by
giving
encouragement
to
it
.
the
principal
lever
relied
on
by
the
insurgent
for
exciting
foreign
nation
to
hostility
against
u
,
a
already
intimated
,
is
the
embarrassment
of
commerce
.
those
nation
,
however
,
not
improbably
saw
from
the
first
that
it
wa
the
union
which
made
a
well
our
foreign
a
our
domestic
commerce
.
they
can
scarcely
have
failed
to
perceive
that
the
effort
for
disunion
produce
the
existing
difficulty
,
and
that
one
strong
nation
promise
more
durable
peace
and
a
more
extensive
,
valuable
,
and
reliable
commerce
than
can
the
same
nation
broken
into
hostile
fragment
.
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
review
our
discussion
with
foreign
state
,
because
,
whatever
might
be
their
wish
or
disposition
,
the
integrity
of
our
country
and
the
stability
of
our
government
mainly
depend
not
upon
them
,
but
on
the
loyalty
,
virtue
,
patriotism
,
and
intelligence
of
the
american
people
.
the
correspondence
itself
,
with
the
usual
reservation
,
is
herewith
submitted
.
i
venture
to
hope
it
will
appear
that
we
have
practiced
prudence
and
liberality
toward
foreign
power
,
averting
cause
of
irritation
and
with
firmness
maintaining
our
own
right
and
honor
.
since
,
however
,
it
is
apparent
that
here
,
a
in
every
other
state
,
foreign
danger
necessarily
attend
domestic
difficulty
,
i
recommend
that
adequate
and
ample
measure
be
adopted
for
maintaining
the
public
defense
on
every
side
.
while
under
this
general
recommendation
provision
for
defending
our
seacoast
line
readily
occurs
to
the
mind
,
i
also
in
the
same
connection
ask
the
attention
of
congress
to
our
great
lake
and
river
.
it
is
believed
that
some
fortification
and
depot
of
arm
and
munition
,
with
harbor
and
navigation
improvement
,
all
at
well-selected
point
upon
these
,
would
be
of
great
importance
to
the
national
defense
and
preservation
.
i
ask
attention
to
the
view
of
the
secretary
of
war
,
expressed
in
his
report
,
upon
the
same
general
subject
.
i
deem
it
of
importance
that
the
loyal
region
of
east
tennessee
and
western
north
carolina
should
be
connected
with
kentucky
and
other
faithful
part
of
the
union
by
railroad
.
i
therefore
recommend
,
a
a
military
measure
,
that
congress
provide
for
the
construction
of
such
road
a
speedily
a
possible
.
kentucky
no
doubt
will
cooperate
,
and
through
her
legislature
make
the
most
judicious
selection
of
a
line
.
the
northern
terminus
must
connect
with
some
existing
railroad
,
and
whether
the
route
shall
be
from
lexington
or
nicholasville
to
the
cumberland
gap
,
or
from
lebanon
to
the
tennessee
line
,
in
the
direction
of
knoxville
,
or
on
some
still
different
line
,
can
easily
be
determined
.
kentucky
and
the
general
government
cooperating
,
the
work
can
be
completed
in
a
very
short
time
,
and
when
done
it
will
be
not
only
of
vast
present
usefulness
,
but
also
a
valuable
permanent
improvement
,
worth
it
cost
in
all
the
future
.
some
treaty
,
designed
chiefly
for
the
interest
of
commerce
,
and
having
no
grave
political
importance
,
have
been
negotiated
,
and
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
their
consideration
.
although
we
have
failed
to
induce
some
of
the
commercial
power
to
adopt
a
desirable
melioration
of
the
rigor
of
maritime
war
,
we
have
removed
all
obstruction
from
the
way
of
this
humane
reform
except
such
a
are
merely
of
temporary
and
accidental
occurrence
.
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
correspondence
between
her
britannic
majesty
's
minister
accredited
to
this
government
and
the
secretary
of
state
relative
to
the
detention
of
the
british
ship
perthshire
in
june
last
by
the
united
state
steamer
massachusetts
for
a
supposed
breach
of
the
blockade
.
a
this
detention
wa
occasioned
by
an
obvious
misapprehension
of
the
fact
,
and
a
justice
requires
that
we
should
commit
no
belligerent
act
not
rounded
in
strict
right
a
sanctioned
by
public
law
,
i
recommend
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
satisfy
the
reasonable
demand
of
the
owner
of
the
vessel
for
her
detention
.
i
repeat
the
recommendation
of
my
predecessor
in
his
annual
message
to
congress
in
december
last
in
regard
to
the
disposition
of
the
surplus
which
will
probably
remain
after
satisfying
the
claim
of
american
citizen
against
china
,
pursuant
to
the
award
of
the
commissioner
under
the
act
of
the
3d
of
march
,
1859
.
if
,
however
,
it
should
not
be
deemed
advisable
to
carry
that
recommendation
into
effect
,
i
would
suggest
that
authority
be
given
for
investing
the
principal
,
over
the
proceeds
of
the
surplus
referred
to
,
in
good
security
,
with
a
view
to
the
satisfaction
of
such
other
just
claim
of
our
citizen
against
china
a
are
not
unlikely
to
arise
hereafter
in
the
course
of
our
extensive
trade
with
that
empire
.
by
the
act
of
the
5th
of
august
last
congress
authorized
the
president
to
instruct
the
commander
of
suitable
vessel
to
defend
themselves
against
and
to
capture
pirate
.
this
authority
ha
been
exercised
in
a
single
instance
only
.
for
the
more
effectual
protection
of
our
extensive
and
valuable
commerce
in
the
eastern
sea
especially
,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
also
be
advisable
to
authorize
the
commander
of
sailing
vessel
to
recapture
any
prize
which
pirate
may
make
of
united
state
vessel
and
their
cargo
,
and
the
consular
court
now
established
by
law
in
eastern
country
to
adjudicate
the
case
in
the
event
that
this
should
not
be
objected
to
by
the
local
authority
.
if
any
good
reason
exists
why
we
should
persevere
longer
in
withholding
our
recognition
of
the
independence
and
sovereignty
of
hayti
and
liberia
,
i
am
unable
to
discern
it
.
unwilling
,
however
,
to
inaugurate
a
novel
policy
in
regard
to
them
without
the
approbation
of
congress
,
i
submit
for
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
an
appropriation
for
maintaining
a
charge
'
d'affaires
near
each
of
those
new
state
.
it
doe
not
admit
of
doubt
that
important
commercial
advantage
might
be
secured
by
favorable
treaty
with
them
.
the
operation
of
the
treasury
during
the
period
which
ha
elapsed
since
your
adjournment
have
been
conducted
with
signal
success
.
the
patriotism
of
the
people
ha
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
the
large
mean
demanded
by
the
public
exigency
.
much
of
the
national
loan
ha
been
taken
by
citizen
of
the
industrial
class
,
whose
confidence
in
their
country
's
faith
and
zeal
for
their
country
's
deliverance
from
present
peril
have
induced
them
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
the
government
the
whole
of
their
limited
acquisition
.
this
fact
imposes
peculiar
obligation
to
economy
in
disbursement
and
energy
in
action
.

together
with
his
view
of
way
and
mean
for
meeting
the
demand
contemplated
by
them
,
will
be
submitted
to
congress
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
.
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
the
expenditure
made
necessary
by
the
rebellion
are
not
beyond
the
resource
of
the
loyal
people
,
and
to
believe
that
the
same
patriotism
which
ha
thus
far
sustained
the
government
will
continue
to
sustain
it
till
peace
and
union
shall
again
bless
the
land
.
i
respectfully
refer
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
for
information
respecting
the
numerical
strength
of
the
army
and
for
recommendation
having
in
view
an
increase
of
it
efficiency
and
the
well-being
of
the
various
branch
of
the
service
intrusted
to
his
care
.
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
the
patriotism
of
the
people
ha
proved
equal
to
the
occasion
,
and
that
the
number
of
troop
tendered
greatly
exceeds
the
force
which
congress
authorized
me
to
call
into
the
field
.
i
refer
with
pleasure
to
those
portion
of
his
report
which
make
allusion
to
the
creditable
degree
of
discipline
already
attained
by
our
troop
and
to
the
excellent
sanitary
condition
of
the
entire
army
.
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
for
an
organization
of
the
militia
upon
a
uniform
basis
is
a
subject
of
vital
importance
to
the
future
safety
of
the
country
,
and
is
commended
to
the
serious
attention
of
congress
.
the
large
addition
to
the
regular
army
,
in
connection
with
the
defection
that
ha
so
considerably
diminished
the
number
of
it
officer
,
give
peculiar
importance
to
his
recommendation
for
increasing
the
corp
of
cadet
to
the
greatest
capacity
of
the
military
academy
.
by
mere
omission
,
i
presume
,
congress
ha
failed
to
provide
chaplain
for
hospital
occupied
by
volunteer
.
this
subject
wa
brought
to
my
notice
,
and
i
wa
induced
to
draw
up
the
form
of
a
letter
,
one
copy
of
which
,
properly
addressed
,
ha
been
delivered
to
each
of
the
person
,
and
at
the
date
respectively
named
and
stated
in
a
schedule
,
containing
also
the
form
of
the
letter
marked
a
,
and
herewith
transmitted
.
these
gentleman
,
i
understand
,
entered
upon
the
duty
designated
at
the
time
respectively
stated
in
the
schedule
,
and
have
labored
faithfully
therein
ever
since
.
i
therefore
recommend
that
they
be
compensated
at
the
same
rate
a
chaplain
in
the
army
.
i
further
suggest
that
general
provision
be
made
for
chaplain
to
serve
at
hospital
,
a
well

with
regiment
.
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
present
in
detail
the
operation
of
that
branch
of
the
service
,
the
activity
and
energy
which
have
characterized
it
administration
,
and
the
result
of
measure
to
increase
it
efficiency
and
power
.
such
have
been
the
addition
,
by
construction
and
purchase
,
that
it
may
almost
be
said
a
navy
ha
been
created
and
brought
into
service
since
our
difficulty
commenced
.
besides
blockading
our
extensive
coast
,
squadron
larger
than
ever
before
assembled
under
our
flag
have
been
put
afloat
and
performed
deed
which
have
increased
our
naval
renown
.
i
would
invite
special
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
for
a
more
perfect
organization
of
the
navy
by
introducing
additional
grade
in
the
service
.
the
present
organization
is
defective
and
unsatisfactory
,
and
the
suggestion
submitted
by
the
department
will
,
it
is
believed
,
if
adopted
,
obviate
the
difficulty
alluded
to
,
promote
harmony
,
and
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
navy
.
there
are
three
vacancy
on
the
bench
of
the
supreme
court
--
two
by
the
decease
of
justice
daniel
and
mclean
and
one
by
the
resignation
of
justice
campbell
.
i
have
so
far
forborne
making
nomination
to
fill
these
vacancy
for
reason
which
i
will
now
state
.
two
of
the
outgoing
judge
resided
within
the
state
now
overrun
by
revolt
,
so
that
if
successor
were
appointed
in
the
same
locality
they
could
not
now
serve
upon
their
circuit
;
and
many
of
the
most
competent
men
there
probably
would
not
take
the
personal
hazard
of
accepting
to
serve
,
even
here
,
upon
the
supreme
bench
.
i
have
been
unwilling
to
throw
all
the
appointment
northward
,
thus
disabling
myself
from
doing
justice
to
the
south
on
the
return
of
peace
;
although
i
may
remark
that
to
transfer
to
the
north
one
which
ha
heretofore
been
in
the
south
would
not
,
with
reference
to
territory
and
population
,
be
unjust
.
during
the
long
and
brilliant
judicial
career
of
judge
mclean
his
circuit
grew
into
an
empire
altogether
too
large
for
any
one
judge
to
give
the
court
therein
more
than
a
nominal
attendance
--
rising
in
population
from
1,470,018
in
1830
to
6,151,405
in
1860
.
besides
this
,
the
country
generally
ha
outgrown
our
present
judicial
system
.
if
uniformity
wa
at
all
intended
,
the
system
requires
that
all
the
state
shall
be
accommodated
with
circuit
court
,
attended
by
supreme
judge
,
while
,
in
fact
,
wisconsin
,
minnesota
,
iowa
,
kansa
,
florida
,
texas
,
california
,
and
oregon
have
never
had
any
such
court
.
nor
can
this
well
be
remedied
without
a
change
in
the
system
,
because
the
adding
of
judge
to
the
supreme
court
,
enough
for
the
accommodation
of
all
part
of
the
country
with
circuit
court
,
would
create
a
court
altogether
too
numerous
for
a
judicial
body
of
any
sort
.
and
the
evil
,
if
it
be
one
,
will
increase
a
new
state
come
into
the
union
.
circuit
court
are
useful
or
they
are
not
useful
.
if
useful
,
no
state
should
be
denied
them
;
if
not
useful
,
no
state
should
have
them
.
let
them
be
provided
for
all
or
abolished
a
to
all
.
three
modification
occur
to
me
,
either
of
which
,
i
think
,
would
be
an
improvement
upon
our
present
system
.
let
the
supreme
court
be
of
convenient
number
in
every
event
;
then
,
first
,
let
the
whole
country
be
divided
into
circuit
of
convenient
size
,
the
supreme
judge
to
serve
in
a
number
of
them
corresponding
to
their
own
number
,
and
independent
circuit
judge
be
provided
for
all
the
rest
;
or
,
secondly
,
let
the
supreme
judge
be
relieved
from
circuit
duty
and
circuit
judge
provided
for
all
the
circuit
;
or
,
thirdly
,
dispense
with
circuit
court
altogether
,
leaving
the
judicial
function
wholly
to
the
district
court
and
an
independent
supreme
court
.
i
respectfully
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
present
condition
of
the
statute
law
,
with
the
hope
that
congress
will
be
able
to
find
an
easy
remedy
for
many
of
the
inconvenience
and
evil
which
constantly
embarrass
those
engaged
in
the
practical
administration
of
them
.
since
the
organization
of
the
government
congress
ha
enacted
some
5,000
act
and
joint
resolution
,
which
fill
more
than
6,000
closely
printed
page
and
are
scattered
through
many
volume
.
many
of
these
act
have
been
drawn
in
haste
and
without
sufficient
caution
,
so
that
their
provision
are
often
obscure
in
themselves
or
in
conflict
with
each
other
,
or
at
least
so
doubtful
a
to
render
it
very
difficult
for
even
the
best-informed
person
to
ascertain
precisely
what
the
statute
law
really
is
.
it
seems
to
me
very
important
that
the
statute
law
should
be
made
a
plain
and
intelligible
a
possible
,
and
be
reduced
to
a
small
a
compass
a
may
consist
with
the
fullness
and
precision
of
the
will
of
the
legislature
and
the
perspicuity
of
it
language
.
this
well
done
would
,
i
think
,
greatly
facilitate
the
labor
of
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
assist
in
the
administration
of
the
law
,
and
would
be
a
lasting
benefit
to
the
people
,
by
placing
before
them
in
a
more
accessible
and
intelligible
form
the
law
which
so
deeply
concern
their
interest
and
their
duty
.
i
am
informed
by
some
whose
opinion
i
respect
that
all
the
act
of
congress
now
in
force
and
of
a
permanent
and
general
nature
might
be
revised
and
rewritten
so
a
to
be
embraced
in
one
volume
(
or
at
most
two
volume
)
of
ordinary
and
convenient
size
;
and
i
respectfully
recommend
to
congress
to
consider
of
the
subject
,
and
if
my
suggestion
be
approved
to
devise
such
plan
a
to
their
wisdom
shall
seem
most
proper
for
the
attainment
of
the
end
proposed
.
one
of
the
unavoidable
consequence
of
the
present
insurrection
is
the
entire
suppression
in
many
place
of
all
the
ordinary
mean
of
administering
civil
justice
by
the
officer
and
in
the
form
of
existing
law
.
this
is
the
case
,
in
whole
or
in
part
,
in
all
the
insurgent
state
;
and
a
our
army
advance
upon
and
take
possession
of
part
of
those
state
the
practical
evil
becomes
more
apparent
.
there
are
no
court
nor
officer
to
whom
the
citizen
of
other
state
may
apply
for
the
enforcement
of
their
lawful
claim
against
citizen
of
the
insurgent
state
,
and
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
debt
constituting
such
claim
.
some
have
estimated
it
a
high
a
$
200,000,000
,
due
in
large
part
from
insurgent
in
open
rebellion
to
loyal
citizen
who
are
even
now
making
great
sacrifice
in
the
discharge
of
their
patriotic
duty
to
support
the
government
.
under
these
circumstance
i
have
been
urgently
solicited
to
establish
by
military
power
court
to
administer
summary
justice
in
such
case
i
have
thus
far
declined
to
do
it
,
not
because
i
had
any
doubt
that
the
end
proposed
--
the
collection
of
the
debt
--
wa
just
and
right
in
itself
,
but
because
i
have
been
unwilling
to
go
beyond
the
pressure
of
necessity
in
the
unusual
exercise
of
power
.
but
the
power
of
congress
,
i
suppose
,
are
equal
to
the
anomalous
occasion
,
and
therefore
i
refer
the
whole
matter
to
congress
,
with
the
hope
that
a
plan
may
be
devised
for
the
administration
of
justice
in
all
such
part
of
the
insurgent
state
and
territory
a
may
be
under
the
control
of
this
government
,
whether
by
a
voluntary
return
to
allegiance
and
order
or
by
the
power
of
our
arm
;
this
,
however
,
not
to
be
a
permanent
institution
,
but
a
temporary
substitute
,
and
to
cease
a
soon
a
the
ordinay
court
can
be
reestablished
in
peace
.
it
is
important
that
some
more
convenient
mean
should
be
provided
,
if
possible
,
for
the
adjustment
of
claim
against
the
government
,
especially
in
view
of
their
increased
number
by
reason
of
the
war
.
it
is
a
much
the
duty
of
government
to
render
prompt
justice
against
itself
in
favor
of
citizen
a
it
is
to
administer
the
same
between
private
individual
.
the
investigation
and
adjudication
of
claim
in
their
nature
belong
to
the
judicial
department
.
besides
,
it
is
apparent
that
the
attention
of
congress
will
be
more
than
usually
engaged
for
some
time
to
come
with
great
national
question
.
it
wa
intended
by
the
organization
of
the
court
of
claim
mainly
to
remove
this
branch
of
business
from
the
hall
of
congress
:
but
while
the
court
ha
proved
to
be
an
effective
and
valuable
mean
of
investigation
,
it
in
great
degree
fails
to
effect
the
object
of
it
creation
for
want
of
power
to
make
it
judgment
final
.
fully
aware
of
the
delicacy
,
not
to
say
the
danger
,
of
the
subject
,
i
commend
to
your
careful
consideration
whether
this
power
of
making
judgment
final
may
not
properly
be
given
to
the
court
,
reserving
the
right
of
appeal
on
question
of
law
to
the
supreme
court
,
with
such
other
provision
a
experience
may
have
shown
to
be
necessary
.
i
ask
attention
to
the
report
of
the
postmaster-general
,
the
following
being
a
summary
statement
of
the
condition
of
the
department
:
the
revenue
from
all
source
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30
,
1861
,
including
the
annual
permanent
appropriation
of
$
700,000
for
the
transportation
of
``
free
mail
matter
,
''
wa
$
9,049,296.40
,
being
about
2
per
cent
le
than
the
revenue
for
1860
.
the
expenditure
were
$
13,606,759.11
,
showing
a
decrease
of
more
than
8
per
cent
a
compared
with
those
of
the
previous
year
and
leaving
an
excess
of
expenditure
over
the
revenue
for
the
last
fiscal
year
of
$
4,557,462.71
.
the
gross
revenue
for
the
year
ending
june
30
,
1863
,
is
estimated
at
an
increase
of
4
per
cent
on
that
of
1861
,
making
$
8,683,000
,
to
which
should
be
added
the
earnings
of
the
department
in
carrying
free
matter
,
viz
,
$
700,000
,
making
$
9,383,000
.
the
total
expenditure
for
1863
are
estimated
at
$
12,528,000
,
leaving
an
estimated
deficiency
of
$
3,145,000
to
be
supplied
from
the
treasury
in
addition
to
the
permanent
appropriation
.
the
present
insurrection
show
,
i
think
,
that
the
extension
of
this
district
across
the
potomac
river
at
the
time
of
establishing
the
capital
here
wa
eminently
wise
,
and
consequently
that
the
relinquishment
of
that
portion
of
it
which
lie
within
the
state
of
virginia
wa
unwise
and
dangerous
.
i
submit
for
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
regaining
that
part
of
the
district
and
the
restoration
of
the
original
boundary
thereof
through
negotiation
with
the
state
of
virginia
.
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
,
with
the
accompanying
document
,
exhibit
the
condition
of
the
several
branch
of
the
public
business
pertaining
to
that
department
.
the
depressing
influence
of
the
insurrection
have
been
specially
felt
in
the
operation
of
the
patent
and
general
land
office
.
the
cash
receipt
from
the
sale
of
public
land
during
the
past
year
have
exceeded
the
expense
of
our
land
system
only
about
$
200,000
.
the
sale
have
been
entirely
suspended
in
the
southern
state
,
while
the
interruption
to
the
business
of
the
country
and
the
diversion
of
large
number
of
men
from
labor
to
military
service
have
obstructed
settlement
in
the
new
state
and
territory
of
the
northwest
.
the
receipt
of
the
patent
office
have
declined
in
nine
month
about
$
100,000
,
rendering
a
large
reduction
of
the
force
employed
necessary
to
make
it
self-sustaining
.
the
demand
upon
the
pension
office
will
be
largely
increased
by
the
insurrection
.
numerous
application
for
pension
,
based
upon
the
casualty
of
the
existing
war
,
have
already
been
made
.
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
many
who
are
now
upon
the
pension
roll
and
in
receipt
of
the
bounty
of
the
government
are
in
the
rank
of
the
insurgent
army
or
giving
them
aid
and
comfort
.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
ha
directed
a
suspension
of
the
payment
of
the
pension
of
such
person
upon
proof
of
their
disloyalty
.
i
recommend
that
congress
authorize
that
officer
to
cause
the
name
of
such
person
to
be
stricken
from
the
pension
roll
.
the
relation
of
the
government
with
the
indian
tribe
have
been
greatly
disturbed
by
the
insurrection
,
especially
in
the
southern
superintendency
and
in
that
of
new
mexico
.
the
indian
country
south
of
kansa
is
in
the
possession
of
insurgent
from
texas
and
arkansas
.
the
agent
of
the
united
state
appointed
since
the
4th
of
march
for
this
superintendency
have
been
unable
to
reach
their
post
,
while
the
most
of
those
who
were
in
office
before
that
time
have
espoused
the
insurrectionary
cause
,
and
assume
to
exercise
the
power
of
agent
by
virtue
of
commission
from
the
insurrectionist
.
it
ha
been
stated
in
the
public
press
that
a
portion
of
those
indian
have
been
organized
a
a
military
force
and
are
attached
to
the
army
of
the
insurgent
.
although
the
government
ha
no
official
information
upon
this
subject
,
letter
have
been
written
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affair
by
several
prominent
chief
giving
assurance
of
their
loyalty
to
the
united
state
and
expressing
a
wish
for
the
presence
of
federal
troop
to
protect
them
.
it
is
believed
that
upon
the
repossession
of
the
country
by
the
federal
force
the
indian
will
readily
cease
all
hostile
demonstration
and
resume
their
former
relation
to
the
government
.
agriculture
,
confessedly
the
largest
interest
of
the
nation
,
ha
not
a
department
nor
a
bureau
,
but
a
clerkship
only
,
assigned
to
it
in
the
government
.
while
it
is
fortunate
that
this
great
interest
is
so
independent
in
it
nature
a
to
not
have
demanded
and
extorted
more
from
the
government
,
i
respectfully
ask
congress
to
consider
whether
something
more
can
not
be
given
voluntarily
with
general
advantage
.
annual
report
exhibiting
the
condition
of
our
agriculture
,
commerce
,
and
manufacture
would
present
a
fund
of
information
of
great
practical
value
to
the
country
.
while
i
make
no
suggestion
a
to
detail
,
i
venture
the
opinion
that
an
agricultural
and
statistical
bureau
might
profitably
be
organized
.
the
execution
of
the
law
for
the
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
ha
been
confided
to
the
department
of
the
interior
.
it
is
a
subject
of
gratulation
that
the
effort
which
have
been
made
for
the
suppression
of
this
inhuman
traffic
have
been
recently
attended
with
unusual
success
.
five
vessel
being
fitted
out
for
the
slave
trade
have
been
seized
and
condemned
.
two
mate
of
vessel
engaged
in
the
trade
and
one
person
in
equipping
a
vessel
a
a
slaver
have
been
convicted
and
subjected
to
the
penalty
of
fine
and
imprisonment
,
and
one
captain
,
taken
with
a
cargo
of
african
on
board
his
vessel
,
ha
been
convicted
of
the
highest
grade
of
offense
under
our
law
,
the
punishment
of
which
is
death
.
the
territory
of
colorado
,
dakota
,
and
nevada
,
created
by
the
last
congress
,
have
been
organized
,
and
civil
administration
ha
been
inaugurated
therein
under
auspex
especially
gratifying
when
it
is
considered
that
the
leaven
of
treason
wa
found
existing
in
some
of
these
new
country
when
the
federal
officer
arrived
there
.
the
abundant
natural
resource
of
these
territory
,
with
the
security
and
protection
afforded
by
organized
government
,
will
doubtless
invite
to
them
a
large
immigration
when
peace
shall
restore
the
business
of
the
country
to
it
accustomed
channel
.
i
submit
the
resolution
of
the
legislature
of
colorado
,
which
evidence
the
patriotic
spirit
of
the
people
of
the
territory
.
so
far
the
authority
of
the
united
state
ha
been
upheld
in
all
the
territory
,
a
it
is
hoped
it
will
be
in
the
future
.
i
commend
their
interest
and
defense
to
the
enlightened
and
generous
care
of
congress
.
i
recommend
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
the
interest
of
the
district
of
columbia
.
the
insurrection
ha
been
the
cause
of
much
suffering
and
sacrifice
to
it
inhabitant
,
and
a
they
have
no
representative
in
congress
that
body
should
not
overlook
their
just
claim
upon
the
government
.
at
your
late
session
a
joint
resolution
wa
adopted
authorizing
the
president
to
take
measure
for
facilitating
a
proper
representation
of
the
industrial
interest
of
the
united
state
at
the
exhibition
of
the
industry
of
all
nation
to
be
holden
at
london
in
the
year
1862
.
i
regret
to
say
i
have
been
unable
to
give
personal
attention
to
this
subject
--
a
subject
at
once
so
interesting
in
itself
and
so
extensively
and
intimately
connected
with
the
material
prosperity
of
the
world
.
through
the
secretary
of
state
and
of
the
interior
a
plan
or
system
ha
been
devised
and
partly
matured
,
and
which
will
be
laid
before
you
.
under
and
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
congress
entitled
``
an
act
to
confiscate
property
used
for
insurrectionary
purpose
,
''
approved
august
6
,
1861
,
the
legal
claim
of
certain
person
to
the
labor
and
service
of
certain
other
person
have
become
forfeited
,
and
number
of
the
latter
thus
liberated
are
already
dependent
on
the
united
state
and
must
be
provided
for
in
some
way
.
besides
this
,
it
is
not
impossible
that
some
of
the
state
will
pas
similar
enactment
for
their
own
benefit
respectively
,
and
by
operation
of
which
person
of
the
same
class
will
be
thrown
upon
them
for
disposal
.
in
such
case
i
recommend
that
congress
provide
for
accepting
such
person
from
such
state
,
according
to
some
mode
of
valuation
,
in
lieu
,
pro
tanto
,
of
direct
tax
,
or
upon
some
other
plan
to
be
agreed
on
with
such
state
respectively
;
that
such
person
,
on
such
acceptance
by
the
general
government
,
be
at
once
deemed
free
,
and
that
in
any
event
step
be
taken
for
colonizing
both
class
(
or
the
one
first
mentioned
if
the
other
shall
not
be
brought
into
existence
)
at
some
place
or
place
in
a
climate
congenial
to
them
.
it
might
be
well
to
consider
,
too
,
whether
the
free
colored
people
already
in
the
united
state
could
not
,
so
far
a
individual
may
desire
,
be
included
in
such
colonization
.
to
carry
out
the
plan
of
colonization
may
involve
the
acquiring
of
territory
,
and
also
the
appropriation
of
money
beyond
that
to
be
expended
in
the
territorial
acquisition
.
having
practiced
the
acquisition
of
territory
for
nearly
sixty
year
,
the
question
of
constitutional
power
to
do
so
is
no
longer
an
open
one
with
u
.
the
power
wa
questioned
at
first
by
mr.
jefferson
,
who
,
however
,
in
the
purchase
of
louisiana
,
yielded
his
scruple
on
the
plea
of
great
expediency
.
if
it

in
considering
the
policy
to
be
adopted
for
suppressing
the
insurrection
i
have
been
anxious
and
careful
that
the
inevitable
conflict
for
this
purpose
shall
not
degenerate
into
a
violent
and
remorseless
revolutionary
struggle
.
i
have
therefore
in
every
case
thought
it
proper
to
keep
the
integrity
of
the
union
prominent
a
the
primary
object
of
the
contest
on
our
part
,
leaving
all
question
which
are
not
of
vital
military
importance
to
the
more
deliberate
action
of
the
legislature
.
in
the
exercise
of
my
best
discretion
i
have
adhered
to
the
blockade
of
the
port
held
by
the
insurgent
,
instead
of
putting
in
force
by
proclamation
the
law
of
congress
enacted
at
the
late
session
for
closing
those
port
.
so
also
,
obeying
the
dictate
of
prudence
,
a
well
a
the
obligation
of
law
,
instead
of
transcending
i
have
adhered
to
the
act
of
congress
to
confiscate
property
used
for
insurrectionary
purpose
.
if
a
new
law
upon
the
same
subject
shall
be
proposed
,
it
propriety
will
be
duly
considered
.
the
union
must
be
preserved
,
and
hence
all
indispensable
mean
must
be
employed
.
we
should
not
be
in
haste
to
determine
that
radical
and
extreme
measure
,
which
may
reach
the
loyal

well

the
disloyal

indispensable

the
inaugural
address
at
the
beginning
of
the
administration
and
the
message
to
congress
at
the
late
special
session
were
both
mainly
devoted
to
the
domestic
controversy
out
of
which
the
insurrection
and
consequent
war
have
sprung
.
nothing
now
occurs
to
add
or

from

last
ray
of
hope
for
preserving

peaceably
expired
at

upon

a
general
review
of
what
ha
occurred
since

not
be
unprofitable

and

likewise
have
some
general
account
of
popular

in
behalf
of

union
in

.
these
thing
demonstrate
that
the
cause
of
the
union
is
advancing
steadily
and
certainly
southward
.
since
your
last
adjournment
lieutenant-general
scott
ha
retired
from
the
head
of
the
army
.
during
his
long
life
the
nation
ha
not
been
unmindful
of
his
merit
;
yet
on
calling
to
mind
how
faithfully
,
ably
,
and
brilliantly
he
ha
served
the
country
,
from
a
time
far
back
in
our
history
,
when
few
of
the
now
living
had
been
born
,
and
thenceforward
continually
,
i
can
not
but
think
we
are
still
his
debtor
.
i
submit
,
therefore
,
for
your
consideration
what
further
mark
of
recognition
is
due
to
him
,
and
to
ourselves
a
a
grateful
people
.
with
the
retirement
of
general
scott
came
the
executive
duty
of
appointing
in
his
stead
a
general
in
chief
of
the
army
.
it
is
a
fortunate
circumstance
that
neither
in
council
nor
country
wa
there
,
so
far
a
i
know
,
any
difference
of
opinion
a
to
the
proper
person
to
be
selected
.
the
retiring
chief
repeatedly
expressed
his
judgment
in
favor
of
general
mcclellan
for
the
position
,
and
in
this
the
nation
seemed
to
give
a
unanimous
concurrence
.
the
designation
of
general
mcclellan
is
therefore
in
considerable
degree
the
selection
of
the
country
a
well
a
of
the
executive
,
and
hence
there
is
better
reason
to
hope
there
will
be
given
him
the
confidence
and
cordial
support
thus
by
fair
implication
promised
,
and
without
which
he
can
not
with
so
full
efficiency
serve
the
country
.
it
ha
been
said
that
one
bad
general
is
better
than
two
good
one
,
and
the
saying
is
true
if
taken
to
mean
no
more
than
that
an
army
is
better
directed
by
a
single
mind
,
though
inferior
,
than
by
two
superior
one
at
variance
and
cross-purpose
with
each
other
.
and
the
same
is
true
in
all
joint
operation
wherein
those
engaged
can
have
none
but
a
common
end
in
view
and
can
differ
only
a
to
the
choice
of
mean
.
in
a
storm
at
sea
no
one
on
board
can
wish
the
ship
to
sink
,
and
yet
not
unfrequently
all
go
down
together
because
too
many
will
direct
and
no
single
mind
can
be
allowed
to
control
.
it
continues
to
develop
that
the
insurrection
is
largely
,
if
not
exclusively
,
a
war
upon
the
first
principle
of
popular
government
--
the
right
of
the
people
.
conclusive
evidence
of
this
is
found
in
the
most
grave
and
maturely
considered
public
document
,
a
well
a
in
the
general
tone
of
the
insurgent
.
in
those
document
we
find
the
abridgment
of
the
existing
right
of
suffrage
and
the
denial
to
the
people
of
all
right
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
public
officer
except
the
legislative
boldly
advocated
,
with
labored
argument
to
prove
that
large
control
of
the
people
in
government
is
the
source
of
all
political
evil
.
monarchy
itself
is
sometimes
hinted
at
a
a
possible
refuge
from
the
power
of
the
people
.
in
my
present
position
i
could
scarcely
be
justified
were
i
to
omit
raising
a
warning
voice
against
this
approach
of
returning
despotism
.
it
is
not
needed
nor
fitting
here
that
a
general
argument
should
be
made
in
favor
of
popular
institution
,
but
there
is
one
point
,
with
it
connection
,
not
so
hackneyed
a
most
others
,
to
which
i
ask
a
brief
attention
.
it
is
the
effort
to
place
capital
on
an
equal
footing
with
,
if
not
above
,
labor
in
the
structure
of
government
.
it
is
assumed
that
labor
is
available
only
in
connection
with
capital
;
that
nobody
labor
unless
somebody
else
,
owning
capital
,
somehow
by
the
use
of
it
induces
him
to
labor
.
this
assumed
,
it
is
next
considered
whether
it
is
best
that
capital
shall
hire
laborer
,
and
thus
induce
them
to
work
by
their
own
consent
,
or
buy
them
and
drive
them
to
it
without
their
consent
.
having
proceeded
so
far
,
it
is
naturally
concluded
that
all
laborer
are
either
hired
laborer
or
what
we
call
slave
.
and
further
,
it
is
assumed
that
whoever
is
once
a
hired
laborer
is
fixed
in
that
condition
for
life
.
now
there
is
no
such
relation
between
capital
and
labor
a
assumed
,
nor
is
there
any
such
thing
a
a
free
man
being
fixed
for
life
in
the
condition
of
a
hired
laborer
.
both
these
assumption
are
false
,
and
all
inference
from
them
are
groundless
.
labor
is
prior
to
and
independent
of
capital
.
capital
is
only
the
fruit
of
labor
,
and
could
never
have
existed
if
labor
had
not
first
existed
.
labor
is
the
superior
of
capital
,
and
deserves
much
the
higher
consideration
.
capital
ha
it
right
,
which
are
a
worthy
of
protection
a
any
other
right
.
nor
is
it
denied
that
there
is
,
and
probably
always
will
be
,
a
relation
between
labor
and
capital
producing
mutual
benefit
.
the
error
is
in
assuming
that
the
whole
labor
of
community
exists
within
that
relation
.
a
few
men
own
capital
,
and
that
few
avoid
labor
themselves
,
and
with
their
capital
hire
or
buy
another
few
to
labor
for
them
.
a
large
majority
belong
to
neither
class
--
neither
work
for
others
nor
have
others
working
for
them
.
in
most
of
the
southern
state
a
majority
of
the
whole
people
of
all
color
are
neither
slave
nor
master
,
while
in
the
northern
a
large
majority
are
neither
hirer
nor
hired
.
men
,
with
their
family
--
wife
,
son
,
and
daughter
--
work
for
themselves
on
their
farm
,
in
their
house
,
and
in
their
shop
,
taking
the
whole
product
to
themselves
,
and
asking
no
favor
of
capital
on
the
one
hand
nor
of
hired
laborer
or
slave
on
the
other
.
it
is
not
forgotten
that
a
considerable
number
of
person
mingle
their
own
labor
with
capital
;
that
is
,
they
labor
with
their
own
hand
and
also
buy
or
hire
others
to
labor
for
them
;
but
this
is
only
a
mixed
and
not
a
distinct
class
.
no
principle
stated
is
disturbed
by
the
existence
of
this
mixed
class
.
again
,
a
ha
already
been
said
,
there
is
not
of
necessity
any
such
thing
a
the
free
hired
laborer
being
fixed
to
that
condition
for
life
.
many
independent
men
everywhere
in
these
state
a
few
year
back
in
their
life
were
hired
laborer
.
the
prudent
,
penniless
beginner
in
the
world
labor
for
wage
awhile
,
save
a
surplus
with
which
to
buy
tool
or
land
for
himself
,
then
labor
on
his
own
account
another
while
,
and
at
length
hire
another
new
beginner
to
help
him
.
this
is
the
just
and
generous
and
prosperous
system
which
open
the
way
to
all
,
give
hope
to
all
,
and
consequent
energy
and
progress
and
improvement
of
condition
to
all
.
no
men
living
are
more
worthy
to
be
trusted
than
those
who
toil
up
from
poverty
;
none
le
inclined
to
take
or
touch
aught
which
they
have
not
honestly
earned
.
let
them
beware
of
surrendering
a
political
power
which
they
already
posse
,
and
which
if
surrendered
will
surely
be
used
to
close
the
door
of
advancement
against
such
a
they
and
to
fix
new
disability
and
burden
upon
them
till
all
of
liberty
shall
be
lost
.
from
the
first
taking
of
our
national
census
to
the
last

seventy

,
and
we
find
our
population
at
the
end
of

period

it
wa
at
the
beginning
.
the
increase
of
those
other
thing
which
men
deem
desirable
ha
been
even
greater
.
we
thus
have
at
one
view
what
the
popular
principle
,
applied
to
government
through
the
machiney
,
of
the
state
and
the
union
,
ha
produced
in

time
,
and
also
what

firmly
maintained

there

already
among
u
those
who
if
the

be
preserved

to

.
the
struggle
of
to-day
is
not
altogether
for
to-day
;
it
is
for
a
vast
future
also
.
with
a
reliance
on
providence
all
the
more
firm
and
earnest
,
let

proceed
in
the
great
task
