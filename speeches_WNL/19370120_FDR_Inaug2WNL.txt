when
four
year
ago
we
met
to
inaugurate
president
,
the
republic
,
single-minded
in
anxiety
,
stood
in
spirit
here
.
we
dedicated
ourselves
to
the
fulfillment
of
a
vision—to
speed
the
time
when
there
would
be
for
all
the
people
that
security
and
peace
essential
to
the
pursuit
of
happiness
.
we
of
the
republic
pledged
ourselves
to
drive
from
the
temple
of
our
ancient
faith
those
who
had
profaned
it
;
to
end
by
action
,
tireless
and
unafraid
,
the
stagnation
and
despair
of
that
day
.
we
did
those
first
thing
first
.
our
covenant
with
ourselves
did
not
stop
there
.
instinctively
we
recognized
a
deeper
need—the
need
to
find
through
government
the
instrument
of
our
united
purpose
to
solve
for
the
individual
the
ever-rising
problem
of
a
complex
civilization
.
repeated
attempt
at
their
solution
without
the
aid
of
government
had
left
u
baffled
and
bewildered
.
for
,
without
that
aid
,
we
had
been
unable
to
create
those
moral
control
over
the
service
of
science
which
are
necessary
to
make
science
a
useful
servant
instead
of
a
ruthless
master
of
mankind
.
to
do
this
we
knew
that
we
must
find
practical
control
over
blind
economic
force
and
blindly
selfish
men
.
we
of
the
republic
sensed
the
truth
that
democratic
government
ha
innate
capacity
to
protect
it
people
against
disaster
once
considered
inevitable
,
to
solve
problem
once
considered
unsolvable
.
we
would
not
admit
that
we
could
not
find
a
way
to
master
economic
epidemic
just
a
,
after
century
of
fatalistic
suffering
,
we
had
found
a
way
to
master
epidemic
of
disease
.
we
refused
to
leave
the
problem
of
our
common
welfare
to
be
solved
by
the
wind
of
chance
and
the
hurricane
of
disaster
.
in
this
we
american
were
discovering
no
wholly
new
truth
;
we
were
writing
a
new
chapter
in
our
book
of
self-government
.
this
year
mark
the
one
hundred
and
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
constitutional
convention
which
made
u
a
nation
.
at
that
convention
our
forefather
found
the
way
out
of
the
chaos
which
followed
the
revolutionary
war
;
they
created
a
strong
government
with
power
of
united
action
sufficient
then
and
now
to
solve
problem
utterly
beyond
individual
or
local
solution
.
a
century
and
a
half
ago
they
established
the
federal
government
in
order
to
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessing
of
liberty
to
the
american
people
.
today
we
invoke
those
same
power
of
government
to
achieve
the
same
objective
.
four
year
of
new
experience
have
not
belied
our
historic
instinct
.
they
hold
out
the
clear
hope
that
government
within
community
,
government
within
the
separate
state
,
and
government
of
the
united
state
can
do
the
thing
the
time
require
,
without
yielding
it
democracy
.
our
task
in
the
last
four
year
did
not
force
democracy
to
take
a
holiday
.
nearly
all
of
u
recognize
that
a
intricacy
of
human
relationship
increase
,
so
power
to
govern
them
also
must
increase
power
to
stop
evil
;
power
to
do
good
.
the
essential
democracy
of
our
nation
and
the
safety
of
our
people
depend
not
upon
the
absence
of
power
,
but
upon
lodging
it
with
those
whom
the
people
can
change
or
continue
at
stated
interval
through
an
honest
and
free
system
of
election
.
the
constitution
of
1787
did
not
make
our
democracy
impotent
.
in
fact
,
in
these
last
four
year
,
we
have
made
the
exercise
of
all
power
more
democratic
;
for
we
have
begun
to
bring
private
autocratic
power
into
their
proper
subordination
to
the
public
's
government
.
the
legend
that
they
were
invincible
above
and
beyond
the
process
of
a
democracy
ha
been
shattered
.
they
have
been
challenged
and
beaten
.
our
progress
out
of
the
depression
is
obvious
.
but
that
is
not
all
that
you
and
i
mean
by
the
new
order
of
thing
.
our
pledge
wa
not
merely
to
do
a
patchwork
job
with
second-hand
material
.
by
using
the
new
material
of
social
justice
we
have
undertaken
to
erect
on
the
old
foundation
a
more
enduring
structure
for
the
better
use
of
future
generation
.
in
that
purpose
we
have
been
helped
by
achievement
of
mind
and
spirit
.
old
truth
have
been
relearned
;
untruth
have
been
unlearned
.
we
have
always
known
that
heedless
self-interest
wa
bad
moral
;
we
know
now
that
it
is
bad
economics
.
out
of
the
collapse
of
a
prosperity
whose
builder
boasted
their
practicality
ha
come
the
conviction
that
in
the
long
run
economic
morality
pay
.
we
are
beginning
to
wipe
out
the
line
that
divide
the
practical
from
the
ideal
;
and
in
so
doing
we
are
fashioning
an
instrument
of
unimagined
power
for
the
establishment
of
a
morally
better
world
.
this
new
understanding
undermines
the
old
admiration
of
worldly
success
a
such
.
we
are
beginning
to
abandon
our
tolerance
of
the
abuse
of
power
by
those
who
betray
for
profit
the
elementary
decency
of
life
.
in
this
process
evil
thing
formerly
accepted
will
not
be
so
easily
condoned
.
hard-headedness
will
not
so
easily
excuse
hardheartedness
.
we
are
moving
toward
an
era
of
good
feeling
.
but
we
realize
that
there
can
be
no
era
of
good
feeling
save
among
men
of
good
will
.
for
these
reason
i
am
justified
in
believing
that
the
greatest
change
we
have
witnessed
ha
been
the
change
in
the
moral
climate
of
america
.
among
men
of
good
will
,
science
and
democracy
together
offer
an
ever-richer
life
and
ever-larger
satisfaction
to
the
individual
.
with
this
change
in
our
moral
climate
and
our
rediscovered
ability
to
improve
our
economic
order
,
we
have
set
our
foot
upon
the
road
of
enduring
progress
.
shall
we
pause
now
and
turn
our
back
upon
the
road
that
lie
ahead
?
shall
we
call
this
the
promised
land
?
or
,
shall
we
continue
on
our
way
?
for
``
each
age
is
a
dream
that
is
dying
,
or
one
that
is
coming
to
birth
.
''
many

are
heard

we
face
a
great
decision
.
comfort

,
``
tarry
a
while

''
opportunism

,
``

true
,
we
have
come
far
from
the
day
of

and

.
vitality
ha
been
preserved

courage
and
confidence
have
been

and

prosperity
already
test
the
persistence
of
our
progressive
purpose
.
let
u
ask
again
:
have
we
reached
the
goal
of
our
vision
of
that
fourth
day
of
march
,
1933
?
have
we
found
our
happy
valley
?
i
see
a
great
nation
,
upon
a
great
continent
,
blessed
with
a
great
wealth
of
natural
resource
.
it
hundred
and
thirty
million
people
are
at
peace
among
themselves
;
they
are
making
their
country
a
good
neighbor
among
the
nation
.
i
see
a
united
state
which
can
demonstrate
that
,
under
democratic
method
of
government
,
national
wealth
can
be
translated
into
a
spreading
volume
of
human
comfort
hitherto
unknown
,
and
the
lowest
standard
of
living
can
be
raised
far
above
the
level
of
mere
subsistence
.
but
here
is
the
challenge
to
our
democracy
:
in
this
nation
i
see
ten
of
million
of
it
citizens—a
substantial
part
of
it
whole
population—who
at
this
very
moment
are
denied
the
greater
part
of
what
the
very
lowest
standard
of
today
call
the
necessity
of
life
.
i
see
million
of
family
trying
to
live
on
income
so
meager
that
the
pall
of
family
disaster
hang
over
them
day
by
day
.
i
see
million
whose
daily
life
in
city
and
on
farm
continue
under
condition
labeled
indecent
by
a
so-called
polite
society
half
a
century
ago
.
i
see
million
denied
education
,
recreation
,
and
the
opportunity
to
better
their
lot
and
the
lot
of
their
child
.
i
see
million
lacking
the
mean
to
buy
the
product
of
farm
and
factory
and
by
their
poverty
denying
work
and
productiveness
to
many
other
million
.
i
see
one-third
of
a
nation
ill-housed
,
ill-clad
,
ill-nourished
.
it
is
not
in
despair
that
i
paint
you
that
picture
.
i
paint
it
for
you
in
hope—because
the
nation
,
seeing
and
understanding
the
injustice
in
it
,
proposes
to
paint
it
out
.
we
are
determined
to
make
every
american
citizen
the
subject
of
his
country
's
interest
and
concern
;
and
we
will
never
regard
any
faithful
,
law-abiding
group
within
our
border
a
superfluous
.
the
test
of
our
progress
is
not
whether
we
add
more
to
the
abundance
of
those
who
have
much
;
it
is
whether
we
provide
enough
for
those
who
have
too
little
.
if
i
know
aught
of
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
our
nation
,
we
will
not
listen
to
comfort
,
opportunism
,
and
timidity
.
we
will
carry
on
.
overwhelmingly
,
we
of
the
republic
are
men
and
woman
of
good
will
;
men
and
woman
who
have
more
than
warm
heart
of
dedication
;
men
and
woman
who
have
cool
head
and
willing
hand
of
practical
purpose
a
well
.
they
will
insist
that
every
agency
of
popular
government
use
effective
instrument
to
carry
out
their
will
.
government
is
competent
when
all
who
compose
it
work
a
trustee
for
the
whole
people
.
it
can
make
constant
progress
when
it
keep
abreast
of
all
the
fact
.
it
can
obtain
justified
support
and
legitimate
criticism
when
the
people
receive
true
information
of
all
that
government
doe
.
if
i
know
aught
of
the
will
of
our
people
,
they
will
demand
that
these
condition
of
effective
government
shall
be
created
and
maintained
.
they
will
demand
a
nation
uncorrupted
by
cancer
of
injustice
and
,
therefore
,
strong
among
the
nation
in
it
example
of
the
will
to
peace
.
today
we
reconsecrate
our
country
to
long-cherished
ideal
in
a
suddenly
changed
civilization
.
in
every
land
there
are
always
at
work
force
that
drive
men
apart
and
force
that
draw
men
together
.
in
our
personal
ambition
we
are
individualist
.
but
in
our
seeking
for
economic
and
political
progress
a
a
nation
,
we
all
go
up
,
or
else
we
all
go
down
,
a
one
people
.
to
maintain
a
democracy
of
effort
requires
a
vast
amount
of
patience
in
dealing
with
differing
method
,
a
vast
amount
of
humility
.
but
out
of
the
confusion
of
many
voice
rise
an
understanding
of
dominant
public
need
.
then
political
leadership
can
voice
common
ideal
,
and
aid
in
their
realization
.
in
taking
again
the
oath
of
office
a
president
of
the
united
state
,
i
assume
the
solemn
obligation
of
leading
the
american
people
forward
along
the
road
over
which
they
have
chosen
to
advance
.
while
this
duty
rest
upon
me
i
shall
do
my
utmost
to
speak
their
purpose
and
to
do
their
will
,
seeking
divine
guidance
to
help
u
each
and
every
one
to
give
light
to
them
that
sit
in
darkness
and
to
guide
our
foot
into
the
way
of
peace
.
