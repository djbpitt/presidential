mr.
vice
president
,
mr.
speaker
,
mr.
chief
justice
,
senator
cook
,
mrs.
eisenhower
,
and
my
fellow
citizen
of
this
great
and
good
country
we
share
together
:
when
we
met
here
four
year
ago
,
america
wa
bleak
in
spirit
,
depressed
by
the
prospect
of
seemingly
endless
war
abroad
and
of
destructive
conflict
at
home
.
a
we
meet
here
today
,
we
stand
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
era
of
peace
in
the
world
.
the
central
question
before
u
is
:
how
shall
we
use
that
peace
?
let
u
resolve
that
this
era
we
are
about
to
enter
will
not
be
what
other
postwar
period
have
so
often
been
:
a
time
of
retreat
and
isolation
that
lead
to
stagnation
at
home
and
invite
new
danger
abroad
.
let
u
resolve
that
this
will
be
what
it
can
become
:
a
time
of
great
responsibility
greatly
borne
,
in
which
we
renew
the
spirit
and
the
promise
of
america
a
we
enter
our
third
century
a
a
nation
.
this
past
year
saw
far-reaching
result
from
our
new
policy
for
peace
.
by
continuing
to
revitalize
our
traditional
friendship
,
and
by
our
mission
to
peking
and
to
moscow
,
we
were
able
to
establish
the
base
for
a
new
and
more
durable
pattern
of
relationship
among
the
nation
of
the
world
.
because
of
america
's
bold
initiative
,
1972
will
be
long
remembered
a
the
year
of
the
greatest
progress
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
toward
a
lasting
peace
in
the
world
.
the
peace
we
seek
in
the
world
is
not
the
flimsy
peace
which
is
merely
an
interlude
between
war
,
but
a
peace
which
can
endure
for
generation
to
come
.
it
is
important
that
we
understand
both
the
necessity
and
the
limitation
of
america's
role
in
maintaining
that
peace
.
unless
we
in
america
work
to
preserve
the
peace
,
there
will
be
no
peace
.
unless
we
in
america
work
to
preserve
freedom
,
there
will
be
no
freedom
.
but
let
u
clearly
understand
the
new
nature
of
america
's
role
,
a
a
result
of
the
new
policy
we
have
adopted
over
these
past
four
year
.
we
shall
respect
our
treaty
commitment
.
we
shall
support
vigorously
the
principle
that
no
country
ha
the
right
to
impose
it
will
or
rule
on
another
by
force
.
we
shall
continue
,
in
this
era
of
negotiation
,
to
work
for
the
limitation
of
nuclear
arm
,
and
to
reduce
the
danger
of
confrontation
between
the
great
power
.
we
shall
do
our
share
in
defending
peace
and
freedom
in
the
world
.
but
we
shall
expect
others
to
do
their
share
.
the
time
ha
passed
when
america
will
make
every
other
nation
's
conflict
our
own
,
or
make
every
other
nation
's
future
our
responsibility
,
or
presume
to
tell
the
people
of
other
nation
how
to
manage
their
own
affair
.
just
a
we
respect
the
right
of
each
nation
to
determine
it
own
future
,
we
also
recognize
the
responsibility
of
each
nation
to
secure
it
own
future
.
just
a
america
's
role
is
indispensable
in
preserving
the
world
's
peace
,
so
is
each
nation
's
role
indispensable
in
preserving
it
own
peace
.
together
with
the
rest
of
the
world
,
let
u
resolve
to
move
forward
from
the
beginning
we
have
made
.
let
u
continue
to
bring
down
the
wall
of
hostility
which
have
divided
the
world
for
too
long
,
and
to
build
in
their
place
bridge
of
understanding
--
so
that
despite
profound
difference
between
system
of
government
,
the
people
of
the
world
can
be
friend
.
let
u
build
a
structure
of
peace
in
the
world
in
which
the
weak
are
a
safe
a
the
strong
--
in
which
each
respect
the
right
of
the
other
to
live
by
a
different
system
--
in
which
those
who
would
influence
others
will
do
so
by
the
strength
of
their
idea
,
and
not
by
the
force
of
their
arm
.
let
u
accept
that
high
responsibility
not
a
a
burden
,
but
gladly
--
gladly
because
the
chance
to
build
such
a
peace
is
the
noblest
endeavor
in
which
a
nation
can
engage
;
gladly
,
also
,
because
only
if
we
act
greatly
in
meeting
our
responsibility
abroad
will
we
remain
a
great
nation
,
and
only
if
we
remain
a
great
nation
will
we
act
greatly
in
meeting
our
challenge
at
home
.
we
have
the
chance
today
to
do
more
than
ever
before
in
our
history
to
make
life
better
in
america
--
to
ensure
better
education
,
better
health
,
better
housing
,
better
transportation
,
a
cleaner
environment
--
to
restore
respect
for
law
,
to
make
our
community
more
livable
--
and
to
insure
the
god-given
right
of
every
american
to
full
and
equal
opportunity
.
because
the
range
of
our
need
is
so
great
--
because
the
reach
of
our
opportunity
is
so
great
--
let
u
be
bold
in
our
determination
to
meet
those
need
in
new
way
.
just
a
building
a
structure
of
peace
abroad
ha
required
turning
away
from
old
policy
that
failed
,
so
building
a
new
era
of
progress
at
home
requires
turning
away
from
old
policy
that
have
failed
.
abroad
,
the
shift
from
old
policy
to
new
ha
not
been
a
retreat
from
our
responsibility
,
but
a
better
way
to
peace
.
and
at
home
,
the
shift
from
old
policy
to
new
will
not
be
a
retreat
from
our
responsibility
,
but
a
better
way
to
progress
.
abroad
and
at
home
,
the
key
to
those
new
responsibility
lie
in
the
placing
and
the
division
of
responsibility
.
we
have
lived
too
long
with
the
consequence
of
attempting
to
gather
all
power
and
responsibility
in
washington
.
abroad
and
at
home
,
the
time
ha
come
to
turn
away
from
the
condescending
policy
of
paternalism
--
of
``
washington
know
best
.
''
a
person
can
be
expected
to
act
responsibly
only
if
he
ha
responsibility
.
this
is
human
nature
.
so
let
u
encourage
individual
at
home
and
nation
abroad
to
do
more
for
themselves
,
to
decide
more
for
themselves
.
let
u
locate
responsibility
in
more
place
.
let
u
measure
what
we
will
do
for
others
by
what
they
will
do
for
themselves
.
that
is
why
today
i
offer
no
promise
of
a
purely
governmental
solution
for
every
problem
.
we
have
lived
too
long
with
that
false
promise
.
in
trusting
too
much
in
government
,
we
have
asked
of
it
more
than
it
can
deliver
.
this
lead
only
to
inflated
expectation
,
to
reduced
individual
effort
,
and
to
a
disappointment
and
frustration
that
erode
confidence
both
in
what
government
can
do
and
in
hat
people
can
do
.
government
must
learn
to
take
le
from
people
so
that
people
an
do
more
for
themselves
.
let
u
remember
that
america
wa
built
not
by
government
,
but
by
people
--
not
by
welfare
,
but
by
work
--
not
by
shirking
responsibility
,
but
by
seeking
responsibility
.
in
our
own
life
,
let
each
of
u
ask
--
not
just
what
will
government
do
for
me
,
but
what
can
i
do
for
myself
?
in
the
challenge
we
face
together
,
let
each
of
u
ask
--
not
just
how
can
government
help
,
but
how
can
i
help
?
your
national
government
ha
a
great
and
vital
role
to
play
.
and
i
pledge
to
you
that
where
this
government
should
act
,
we
will
act
boldly
and
we
will
lead
boldly
.
but
just
a
important
is
the
role
that
each
and
every
one
of
u
must
play
,
a
an
individual
and
a
a
member
of
his
own
community
.
from
this
day
forward
,
let
each
of
u
make
a
solemn
commitment
in
his
own
heart
:
to
bear
his
responsibility
,
to
do
his
part
,
to
live
his
ideal
--
so
that
together
,
we
can
see
the
dawn
of
a
new
age
of
progress
for
america
,
and
together
,
a
we
celebrate
our
200th
anniversary
a
a
nation
,
we
can
do
so
proud
in
the
fulfillment
of
our
promise
to
ourselves
and
to
the
world
.
a
america
's
longest
and
most
difficult
war
come
to
an
end
,
let
u
again
learn
to
debate
our
difference
with
civility
and
decency
.
and
let
each
of
u
reach
out
for
that
one
precious
quality
government
can
not
provide
--
a
new
level
of
respect
for
the
right
and
feeling
of
one
another
,
a
new
level
of
respect
for
the
individual
human
dignity
which
is
the
cherished
birthright
of
every
american
.
above
all
else
,
the
time
ha
come
for
u
to
renew
our
faith
in
ourselves
and
in
america
.
in
recent
year
,
that
faith
ha
been
challenged
.
our
child
have
been
taught
to
be
ashamed
of
their
country
,
ashamed
of
their
parent
,
ashamed
of
america
's
record
at
home
and
of
it
role
in
the
world
.
at
every
turn
,
we
have
been
beset
by
those
who
find
everything
wrong
with
america
and
little
that
is
right
.
but
i
am
confident
that
this
will
not
be
the
judgment
of
history
on
these
remarkable
time
in
which
we
are
privileged
to
live
.
america
's
record
in
this
century
ha
been
unparalleled
in
the
world
's
history
for
it
responsibility
,
for
it
generosity
,
for
it
creativity
and
for
it
progress
.
let
u
be
proud
that
our
system
ha
produced
and
provided
more
freedom
and
more
abundance
,
more
widely
shared
,
than
any
other
system
in
the
history
of
the
world
.
let
u
be
proud
that
in
each
of
the
four
war
in
which
we
have
been
engaged
in
this
century
,
including
the
one
we
are
now
bringing
to
an
end
,
we
have
fought
not
for
our
selfish
advantage
,
but
to
help
others
resist
aggression
.
let
u
be
proud
that
by
our
bold
,
new
initiative
,
and
by
our
steadfastness
for
peace
with
honor
,
we
have
made
a
break-through
toward
creating
in
the
world
what
the
world
ha
not
known
before
--
a
structure
of
peace
that
can
last
,
not
merely
for
our
time
,
but
for
generation
to
come
.
we
are
embarking
here
today
on
an
era
that
present
challenge
great
a
those
any
nation
,
or
any
generation
,
ha
ever
faced
.
we
shall
answer
to
god
,
to
history
,
and
to
our
conscience
for
the
way
in
which
we
use
these
year
.
a
i
stand
in
this
place
,
so
hallowed
by
history
,
i
think
of
others
who
have
stood
here
before
me
.
i
think
of
the
dream
they
had
for
america
,
and
i
think
of
how
each
recognized
that
he
needed
help
far
beyond
himself
in
order
to
make
those
dream
come
true
.
today
,
i
ask
your
prayer
that
in
the
year
ahead
i
may
have
god
's
help
in
making
decision
that
are
right
for
america
,
and
i
pray
for
your
help
so
that
together
we
may
be
worthy
of
our
challenge
.
let
u
pledge
together
to
make
these
next
four
year
the
best
four
year
in
america's
history
,
so
that
on
it
200th
birthday
america
will
be
a
young
and
a
vital
a
when
it
began
,
and
a
bright
a
beacon
of
hope
for
all
the
world
.
let
u
go
forward
from
here
confident
in
hope
,
strong
in
our
faith
in
one
another
,
sustained
by
our
faith
in
god
who
created
u
,
and
striving
always
to
serve
his
purpose
.
