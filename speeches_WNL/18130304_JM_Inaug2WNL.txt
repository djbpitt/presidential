about
to
add
the
solemnity
of
an
oath
to
the
obligation
imposed
by
a
second
call
to
the
station
in
which
my
country
heretofore
placed
me
,
i
find
in
the
presence
of
this
respectable
assembly
an
opportunity
of
publicly
repeating
my
profound
sense
of
so
distinguished
a
confidence
and
of
the
responsibility
united
with
it
.
the
impression
on
me
are
strengthened
by
such
an
evidence
that
my
faithful
endeavor
to
discharge
my
arduous
duty
have
been
favorably
estimated
,
and
by
a
consideration
of
the
momentous
period
at
which
the
trust
ha
been
renewed
.
from
the
weight
and
magnitude
now
belonging
to
it
i
should
be
compelled
to
shrink
if
i
had
le
reliance
on
the
support
of
an
enlightened
and
generous
people
,
and
felt
le
deeply
a
conviction
that
the
war
with
a
powerful
nation
,
which
form
so
prominent
a
feature
in
our
situation
,
is
stamped
with
that
justice
which
invite
the
smile
of
heaven
on
the
mean
of
conducting
it
to
a
successful
termination
.
may
we
not
cherish
this
sentiment
without
presumption
when
we
reflect
on
the
character
by
which
this
war
is
distinguished
?
it
wa
not
declared
on
the
part
of
the
united
state
until
it
had
been
long
made
on
them
,
in
reality
though
not
in
name
;
until
argument
and
postulation
had
been
exhausted
;
until
a
positive
declaration
had
been
received
that
the
wrong
provoking
it
would
not
be
discontinued
;
nor
until
this
last
appeal
could
no
longer
be
delayed
without
breaking
down
the
spirit
of
the
nation
,
destroying
all
confidence
in
itself
and
in
it
political
institution
,
and
either
perpetuating
a
state
of
disgraceful
suffering
or
regaining
by
more
costly
sacrifice
and
more
severe
struggle
our
lost
rank
and
respect
among
independent
power
.
on
the
issue
of
the
war
are
staked
our
national
sovereignty
on
the
high
sea
and
the
security
of
an
important
class
of
citizen
whose
occupation
give
the
proper
value
to
those
of
every
other
class
.
not
to
contend
for
such
a
stake
is
to
surrender
our
equality
with
other
power
on
the
element
common
to
all
and
to
violate
the
sacred
title
which
every
member
of
the
society
ha
to
it
protection
.
i
need
not
call
into
view
the
unlawfulness
of
the
practice
by
which
our
mariner
are
forced
at
the
will
of
every
cruising
officer
from
their
own
vessel
into
foreign
one
,
nor
paint
the
outrage
inseparable
from
it
.
the
proof
are
in
the
record
of
each
successive
administration
of
our
government
,
and
the
cruel
suffering
of
that
portion
of
the
american
people
have
found
their
way
to
every
bosom
not
dead
to
the
sympathy
of
human
nature
.
a
the
war
wa
just
in
it
origin
and
necessary
and
noble
in
it
object
,
we
can
reflect
with
a
proud
satisfaction
that
in
carrying
it
on
no
principle
of
justice
or
honor
,
no
usage
of
civilized
nation
,
no
precept
of
courtesy
or
humanity
,
have
been
infringed
.
the
war
ha
been
waged
on
our
part
with
scrupulous
regard
to
all
these
obligation
,
and
in
a
spirit
of
liberality
which
wa
never
surpassed
.
how
little
ha
been
the
effect
of
this
example
on
the
conduct
of
the
enemy
!
they
have
retained
a
prisoner
of
war
citizen
of
the
united
state
not
liable
to
be
so
considered
under
the
usage
of
war
.
they
have
refused
to
consider
a
prisoner
of
war
,
and
threatened
to
punish
a
traitor
and
deserter
,
person
emigrating
without
restraint
to
the
united
state
,
incorporated
by
naturalization
into
our
political
family
,
and
fighting
under
the
authority
of
their
adopted
country
in
open
and
honorable
war
for
the
maintenance
of
it
right
and
safety
.
such
is
the
avowed
purpose
of
a
government
which
is
in
the
practice
of
naturalizing
by
thousand
citizen
of
other
country
,
and
not
only
of
permitting
but
compelling
them
to
fight
it
battle
against
their
native
country
.
they
have
not
,
it
is
true
,
taken
into
their
own
hand
the
hatchet
and
the
knife
,
devoted
to
indiscriminate
massacre
,
but
they
have
let
loose
the
savage
armed
with
these
cruel
instrument
;
have
allured
them
into
their
service
,
and
carried
them
to
battle
by
their
side
,
eager
to
glut
their
savage
thirst
with
the
blood
of
the
vanquished
and
to
finish
the
work
of
torture
and
death
on
maimed
and
defenseless
captive
.
and
,
what
wa
never
before
seen
,
british
commander
have
extorted
victory
over
the
unconquerable
valor
of
our
troop
by
presenting
to
the
sympathy
of
their
chief
captive
awaiting
massacre
from
their
savage
associate
.
and
now
we
find
them
,
in
further
contempt
of
the
mode
of
honorable
warfare
,
supplying
the
place
of
a
conquering
force
by
attempt
to
disorganize
our
political
society
,
to
dismember
our
confederated
republic
.
happily
,
like
others
,
these
will
recoil
on
the
author
;
but
they
mark
the
degenerate
counsel
from
which
they
emanate
,
and
if
they
did
not
belong
to
a
sense
of
unexampled
inconsistency
might
excite
the
greater
wonder
a
proceeding
from
a
government
which
founded
the
very
war
in
which
it
ha
been
so
long
engaged
on
a
charge
against
the
disorganizing
and
insurrectional
policy
of
it
adversary
.
to
render
the
justice
of
the
war
on
our
part
the
more
conspicuous
,
the
reluctance
to
commence
it
wa
followed
by
the
earliest
and
strongest
manifestation
of
a
disposition
to
arrest
it
progress
.
the
sword
wa
scarcely
out
of
the
scabbard
before
the
enemy
wa
apprised
of
the
reasonable
term
on
which
it
would
be
resheathed
.
still
more
precise
advance
were
repeated
,
and
have
been
received
in
a
spirit
forbidding
every
reliance
not
placed
on
the
military
resource
of
the
nation
.
these
resource
are
amply
sufficient
to
bring
the
war
to
an
honorable
issue
.
our
nation
is
in
number
more
than
half
that
of
the
british
isle
.
it
is
composed
of
a
brave
,
a
free
,
a
virtuous
,
and
an
intelligent
people
.
our
country
abounds
in
the
necessary
,
the
art
,
and
the
comfort
of
life
.
a
general
prosperity
is
visible
in
the
public
countenance
.
the
mean
employed
by
the
british
cabinet
to
undermine
it
have
recoiled
on
themselves
;
have
given
to
our
national
faculty
a
more
rapid
development
,
and
,
draining
or
diverting
the
precious
metal
from
british
circulation
and
british
vault
,
have
poured
them
into
those
of
the
united
state
.
it
is
a
propitious
consideration
that
an
unavoidable
war
should
have
found
this
seasonable
facility
for
the
contribution
required
to
support
it
.
when
the
public
voice
called
for
war
,
all
knew
,
and
still
know
,
that
without
them
it
could
not
be
carried
on
through
the
period
which
it
might
last
,
and
the
patriotism
,
the
good
sense
,
and
the
manly
spirit
of
our
fellow-citizens
are
pledge
for
the
cheerfulness
with
which
they
will
bear
each
his
share
of
the
common
burden
.
to
render
the
war
short
and
it
success
sure
,
animated
and
systematic
exertion
alone
are
necessary
,
and
the
success
of
our
arm
now
may
long
preserve
our
country
from
the
necessity
of
another
resort
to
them
.
already
have
the
gallant
exploit
of
our
naval
hero
proved
to
the
world
our
inherent
capacity
to
maintain
our
right
on
one
element
.
if
the
reputation
of
our
arm
ha
been
thrown
under
cloud
on
the
other
,
presaging
flash
of
heroic
enterprise
assure
u
that
nothing
is
wanting
to
correspondent
triumph
there
also
but
the
discipline
and
habit
which
are
in
daily
progress
.
