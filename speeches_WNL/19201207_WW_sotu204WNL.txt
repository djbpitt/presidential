gentleman
of
the
congress
:
when
i
addressed
myself
to
performing
the
duty
laid
upon
the
president
by
the
constitution
to
present
to
you
an
annual
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
,
i
found
my
thought
dominated
by
an
immortal
sentence
of
abraham
lincoln's-
''
let
u
have
faith
that
right
make
might
,
and
in
that
faith
let
u
dare
to
do
our
duty
a
we
understand
it
''
-a
sentence
immortal
because
it
embodies
in
a
form
of
utter
simplicity
and
purity
the
essential
faith
of
the
nation
,
the
faith
in
which
it
wa
conceived
,
and
the
faith
in
which
it
ha
grown
to
glory
and
power
.
with
that
faith
and
the
birth
of
a
nation
founded
upon
it
came
the
hope
into
the
world
that
a
new
order
would
prevail
throughout
the
affair
of
mankind
,
an
order
in
which
reason
and
right
would
take
precedence
over
covetousness
and
force
;
and
i
believe
that
i
express
the
wish
and
purpose
of
every
thoughtful
american
when
i
say
that
this
sentence
mark
for
u
in
the
plainest
manner
the
part
we
should
play
alike
in
the
arrangement
of
our
domestic
affair
and
in
our
exercise
of
influence
upon
the
affair
of
the
world
.
by
this
faith
,
and
by
this
faith
alone
,
can
the
world
be
lifted
out
of
it
present
confusion
and
despair
.
it
wa
this
faith
which
prevailed
over
the
wicked
force
of
germany
.
you
will
remember
that
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
war
came
when
the
german
people
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
conscience
of
the
world
and
realized
that
right
wa
everywhere
arrayed
against
the
wrong
that
their
government
wa
attempting
to
perpetrate
.
i
think
,
therefore
,
that
it
is
true
to
say
that
this
wa
the
faith
which
won
the
war
.
certainly
this
is
the
faith
with
which
our
gallant
men
went
into
the
field
and
out
upon
the
sea
to
make
sure
of
victory
.
this
is
the
mission
upon
which
democracy
came
into
the
world
.
democracy
is
an
assertion
of
the
right
of
the
individual
to
live
and
to
be
treated
justly
a
against
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
any
combination
of
individual
to
make
law
which
will
overburden
him
or
which
will
destroy
his
equality
among
his
fellow
in
the
matter
of
right
or
privilege
;
and
i
think
we
all
realize
that
the
day
ha
come
when
democracy
is
being
put
upon
it
final
test
.
the
old
world
is
just
now
suffering
from
a
wanton
rejection
of
the
principle
of
democracy
and
a
substitution
of
the
principle
of
autocracy
a
asserted
in
the
name
,
but
without
the
authority
and
sanction
,
of
the
multitude
.
this
is
the
time
of
all
others
when
democracy
should
prove
it
purity
and
it
spiritual
power
to
prevail
.
it
is
surely
the
manifest
destiny
of
the
united
state
to
lead
in
the
attempt
to
make
this
spirit
prevail
.
there
are
two
way
in
which
the
united
state
can
assist
to
accomplish
this
great
object
.
first
,
by
offering
the
example
within
her
own
border
of
the
will
and
power
of
democracy
to
make
and
enforce
law
which
are
unquestionably
just
and
which
are
equal
in
their
administration-laws
which
secure
it
full
right
to
labor
and
yet
at
the
same
time
safeguard
the
integrity
of
property
,
and
particularly
of
that
property
which
is
devoted
to
the
development
of
industry
and
the
increase
of
the
necessary
wealth
of
the
world
.
second
,
by
standing
for
right
and
justice
a
toward
individual
nation
.
the
law
of
democracy
is
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
,
and
the
influence
of
every
democracy
in
the
world
should
be
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
nation
,
the
nation
which
is
struggling
toward
it
right
and
toward
it
proper
recognition
and
privilege
in
the
family
of
nation
.
the
united
state
can
not
refuse
this
role
of
champion
without
putting
the
stigma
of
rejection
upon
the
great
and
devoted
men
who
brought
it
government
into
existence
and
established
it
in
the
face
of
almost
universal
opposition
and
intrigue
,
even
in
the
face
of
wanton
force
,
a
,
for
example
,
against
the
order
in
council
of
great
britain
and
the
arbitrary
napoleonic
decree
which
involved
u
in
what
we
know
a
the
war
of
1812
.
i
urge
you
to
consider
that
the
display
of
an
immediate
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
remedy
any
injustice
or
evil
that
may
have
shown
themselves
in
our
own
national
life
will
afford
the
most
effectual
offset
to
the
force
of
chaos
and
tyranny
which
are
playing
so
disastrous
a
part
in
the
fortune
of
the
free
people
of
more
than
one
part
of
the
world
.
the
united
state
is
of
necessity
the
sample
democracy
of
the
world
,
and
the
triumph
of
democracy
depends
upon
it
success
.
recovery
from
the
disturbing
and
sometimes
disastrous
effect
of
the
late
war
ha
been
exceedingly
slow
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
,
and
ha
given
promise
,
i
venture-to
say
,
of
early
completion
only
in
our
own
fortunate
country
;
but
even
with
u
the
recovery
halt
and
is
impeded
at
time
,
and
there
are
immediately
serviceable
act
of
legislation
which
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
attempt
,
to
assist
that
recovery
and
prove
the
indestructible
recuperative
force
of
a
great
government
of
the
people
.
one
of
these
is
to
prove
that
a
great
democracy
can
keep
house
a
successfully
and
in
a
business-like
a
fashion
a
any
other
government
.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
step
toward
providing
this
is
to
supply
ourselves
with
a
systematic
method
of
handling
our
estimate
and
expenditure
and
bringing
them
to
the
point
where
they
will
not
be
an
unnecessary
strain
upon
our
income
or
necessitate
unreasonable
taxation
;
in
other
word
,
a
workable
budget
system
.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
two
element
are
essential
to
such
a
system-namely
,
not
only
that
the
proposal
of
appropriation
should
be
in
the
hand
of
a
single
body
,
such
a
a
single
appropriation
committee
in
each
house
of
the
congress
,
but
also
that
this
body
should
be
brought
into
such
cooperation
with
the
department
of
the
government
and
with
the
treasury
of
the
united
state
a
would
enable
it
to
act
upon
a
complete
conspectus
of
the
need
of
the
government
and
the
resource
from
which
it
must
draw
it
income
.
i
reluctantly
vetoed
the
budget
bill
passed
by
the
last
session
of
the
congress
because
of
a
constitutional
objection
.
the
house
of
representative
subsequently
modified
the
bill
in
order
to
meet
this
objection
.
in
the
revised
form
,
i
believe
that
the
bill
,
coupled
with
action
already
taken
by
the
congress
to
revise
it
rule
and
procedure
,
furnishes
the
foundation
for
an
effective
national
budget
system
.
i
earnestly
hope
,
therefore
,
that
one
of
the
first
step
to
be
taken
by
the
present
session
of
the
congress
will
be
to
pas
the
budget
bill
.
the
nation
's
finance
have
shown
marked
improvement
during
the
last
year
.
the
total
ordinary
receipt
of
$
6,694,000,000
for
the
fiscal
year
1920
exceeded
those
for
1919
by
$
1,542,000,000
,
while
the
total
net
ordinary
expenditure
decreased
from
$
18,514,000,000
to
$
6,403,000,000
.
the
gross
public
debt
,
which
reached
it
highest
point
on
august
31
,
1919
,
when
it
wa
$
26,596,000,000
,
had
dropped
on
november
30
,
1920
,
to
$
24,175,000,000
.
there
ha
also
been
a
marked
decrease
in
holding
of
government
war
security
by
the
banking
institution
of
the
country
,
a
well
a
in
the
amount
of
bill
held
by
the
federal
reserve
bank
secured
by
government
war
obligation
.
this
fortunate
result
ha
relieved
the
bank
and
left
them
freer
to
finance
the
need
of
agriculture
,
industry
,
and
commerce
.
it
ha
been
due
in
large
part
to
the
reduction
of
the
public
debt
,
especially
of
the
floating
debt
,
but
more
particularly
to
the
improved
distribution
of
government
security
among
permanent
investor
.
the
cessation
of
the
government's
borrowing
,
except
through
short-term
certificate
of
indebtedness
,
ha
been
a
matter
of
great
consequence
to
the
people
of
the
country
at
large
,
a
well
a
to
the
holder
of
liberty
bond
and
victory
note
,
and
ha
had
an
important
bearing
on
the
matter
of
effective
credit
control
.
the
year
ha
been
characterized
by
the
progressive
withdrawal
of
the
treasury
from
the
domestic
credit
market
and
from
a
position
of
dominant
influence
in
that
market
.
the
future
course
will
necessarily
depend
upon
the
extent
to
which
economy
are
practiced
and
upon
the
burden
placed
upon
the
treasury
,
a
well
a
upon
industrial
development
and
the
maintenance
of
tax
receipt
at
a
sufficiently
high
level
.
the
fundamental
fact
which
at
present
dominates
the
government
's
financial
situation
is
that
seven
and
a
half
billion
of
it
war
indebtedness
mature
within
the
next
two
and
a
half
year
.
of
this
amount
,
two
and
a
half
billion
are
floating
debt
and
five
billion
,
victory
note
and
war
.
saving
certificate
.
the
fiscal
program
of
the
government
must
be
determined
with
reference
to
these
maturity
.
sound
policy
demand
that
government
expenditure
be
reduced
to
the
lowest
amount
which
will
permit
the
various
service
to
operate
efficiently
and
that
government
receipt
from
tax
and
salvage
be
maintained
sufficiently
high
to
provide
for
current
requirement
,
including
interest
and
sinking
fund
charge
on
the
public
debt
,
and
at
the
same
time
retire
the
floating
debt
and
part
of
the
victory
loan
before
maturity
.
with
rigid
economy
,
vigorous
salvage
operation
,
and
adequate
revenue
from
taxation
,
a
surplus
of
current
receipt
over
current
expenditure
can
be
realized
and
should
be
applied
to
the
floating
debt
.
all
branch
of
the
government
should
cooperate
to
see
that
this
program
is
realized
.
i
can
not
overemphasize
the
necessity
of
economy
in
government
appropriation
and
expenditure
and
the
avoidance
by
the
congress
of
practice
which
take
money
from
the
treasury
by
indefinite
or
revolving
fund
appropriation
.
the
estimate
for
the
present
year
show
that
over
a
billion
dollar
of
expenditure
were
authorized
by
the
last
congress
in
addition
to
the
amount
shown
in
the
usual
compiled
statement
of
appropriation
.
this
strikingly
illustrates
the
importance
of
making
direct
and
specific
appropriation
.
the
relation
between
the
current
receipt
and
current
expenditure
of
the
government
during
the
present
fiscal
year
,
a
well
a
during
the
last
half
of
the
last
fiscal
year
,
ha
been
disturbed
by
the
extraordinary
burden
thrown
upon
the
treasury
by
the
transportation
act
,
in
connection
with
the
return
of
the
railroad
to
private
control
.
over
$
600,000,000
ha
already
been
paid
to
the
railroad
under
this
act-
$
350,000,000
during
the
present
fiscal
year
;
and
it
is
estimated
that
further
payment
aggregating
possibly
$
650,000,000
must
still
be
made
to
the
railroad
during
the
current
year
.
it
is
obvious
that
these
large
payment
have
already
seriously
limited
the
government
's
progress
in
retiring
the
floating
debt
.
closely
connected
with
this
,
it
seems
to
me
,
is
the
necessity
for
an
immediate
consideration
of
the
revision
of
our
tax
law
.
simplification
of
the
income
and
profit
tax
ha
become
an
immediate
necessity
.
these
tax
performed
an
indispensable
service
during
the
war
.
the
need
for
their
simplification
,
however
,
is
very
great
,
in
order
to
save
the
taxpayer
inconvenience
and
expense
and
in
order
to
make
his
liability
more
certain
and
definite
.
other
and
more
detailed
recommendation
with
regard
to
tax
will
no
doubt
be
laid
before
you
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
.
it
is
my
privilege
to
draw
to
the
attention
of
congress
for
very
sympathetic
consideration
the
problem
of
providing
adequate
facility
for
the
care
and
treatment
of
former
member
of
the
military
and
naval
force
who
are
sick
and
disabled
a
the
result
of
their
participation
in
the
war
.
these
heroic
men
can
never
be
paid
in
money
for
the
service
they
patriotically
rendered
the
nation
.
their
reward
will
lie
rather
in
realization
of
the
fact
that
they
vindicated
the
right
of
their
country
and
aided
in
safeguarding
civilization
.
the
nation
's
gratitude
must
be
effectively
revealed
to
them
by
the
most
ample
provision
for
their
medical
care
and
treatment
a
well
a
for
their
vocational
training
and
placement
.
the
time
ha
come
when
a
more
complete
program
can
be
formulated
and
more
satisfactorily
administered
for
their
treatment
and
training
,
and
i
earnestly
urge
that
the
congress
give
the
matter
it
early
consideration
.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
board
for
vocational
education
will
outline
in
their
annual
report
proposal
covering
medical
care
and
rehabilitation
which
i
am
sure
will
engage
your
earnest
study
and
commend
your
most
generous
support
.
permit
me
to
emphasize
once
more
the
need
for
action
upon
certain
matter
upon
which
i
dwelt
at
some
length
in
my
message
to
the
second
session
of
the
sixty-sixth
congress
.
the
necessity
,
for
example
,
of
encouraging
the
manufacture
of
dyestuff
and
related
chemical
;
the
importance
of
doing
everything
possible
to
promote
agricultural
production
along
economic
line
,
to
improve
agricultural
marketing
,
and
to
make
rural
life
more
attractive
and
healthful
;
the
need
for
a
law
regulating
cold
storage
in
such
a
way
a
to
limit
the
time
during
which
good
may
be
kept
in
storage
,
prescribing
the
method
of
disposing
of
them
if
kept
beyond
the
permitted
period
,
and
requiring
good
released
from
storage
in
all
case
to
bear
the
date
of
their
receipt
.
it
would
also
be
most
serviceable
if
it
were
provided
that
all
good
released
from
cold
storage
for
interstate
shipment
should
have
plainly
marked
upon
each
package
the
selling
or
market
price
at
which
they
went
into
storage
,
in
order
that
the
purchaser
might
be
able
to
learn
what
profit
stood
between
him
and
the
producer
or
the
wholesale
dealer
.
indeed
,
it
would
be
very
serviceable
to
the
public
if
all
good
destined
for
interstate
commerce
were
made
to
carry
upon
every
packing
case
whose
form
made
it
possible
a
plain
statement
of
the
price
at
which
they
left
the
hand
of
the
producer
.
i
respectfully
call
your
attention
also
to
the
recommendation
of
the
message
referred
to
with
regard
to
a
federal
license
for
all
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
.
in
brief
,
the
immediate
legislative
need
of
the
time
is
the
removal
of
all
obstacle
to
the
realization
of
the
best
ambition
of
our
people
in
their
several
class
of
employment
and
the
strengthening
of
all
instrumentality
by
.
which
difficulty
are
to
be
met
and
removed
and
justice
dealt
out
,
whether
by
law
or
by
some
form
of
mediation
and
conciliation
.
i
do
not
feel
it
to
be
my
privilege
at
present
to
,
suggest
the
detailed
and
particular
method
by
which
these
object
may
be
attained
,
but
i
have
faith
that
the
inquiry
of
your
several
committee
will
discover
the
way
and
the
method
.
in
response
to
what
i
believe
to
be
the
impulse
of
sympathy
and
opinion
throughout
the
united
state
,
i
earnestly
suggest
that
the
congress
authorize
the
treasury
of
the
united
state
to
make
to
the
struggling
government
of
armenia
such
a
loan
a
wa
made
to
several
of
the
allied
government
during
the
war
,
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
provide
in
the
legislation
itself
that
the
expenditure
of
the
money
thus
loaned
should
be
under
the
supervision
of
a
commission
,
or
at
least
a
commissioner
,
from
the
united
state
in
order
that
revolutionary
tendency
within
armenia
itself
might
not
be
afforded
by
the
loan
a
further
tempting
opportunity
.
allow
me
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
people
of
the
philippine
island
have
succeeded
in
maintaining
a
stable
government
since
the
last
action
of
the
congress
in
their
behalf
,
and
have
thus
fulfilled
the
condition
set
by
the
congress
a
precedent
to
a
consideration
of
granting
independence
to
the
island
.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
condition
precedent
having
been
fulfilled
,
it
is
now
our
liberty
and
our
duty
to
keep
our
promise
to
the
people
of
those
island
by
granting
them
the
independence
which
they
so
honorably
covet
.
i
have
not
so
much
laid
before
you
a
series
of
recommendation
,
gentleman
,
a
sought
to
utter
a
confession
of
faith
,
of
the
faith
in
which
i
wa
bred
and
which
it
is
my
solemn
purpose
to
stand
by
until
my
last
fighting
day
.
i
believe
this
to
be
the
faith
of
america
,
the
faith
of
the
future
,
and
of
all
the
victory
which
await
national
action
in
the
day
to
come
,
whether
in
america
or
elsewhere
.
