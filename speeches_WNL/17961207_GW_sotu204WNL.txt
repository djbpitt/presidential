fellow-citizens

:
in
recurring
to
the
internal
situation
of
our
country
since
i
had
last
the
pleasure
to
address
you
,
i
find
ample
reason
for
a
renewed
expression
of
that
gratitude
to
the
ruler
of
the
universe
which
a
continued
series
of
prosperity
ha
so
often
and
so
justly
called
forth
.
the

of
the
last

arrangement

been
a

admit

into

measure
calculated
to
insure
a
continuance
of
the
friendship
of
the
indian
and
to
preserve
peace
along
the
extent
of
our
interior
frontier
have
been
digested
and
adopted
.
in
the
framing
of
these
care
ha
been
taken
to
guard
on
the
one
hand
our
advanced
settlement
from
the
predatory
incursion
of
those
unruly
individual
who
can
not
be
restrained
by
their
tribe
,
and
on
the
other
hand
to
protect
the
right
secured
to
the
indian
by
treaty
-
to
draw
them
nearer
to
the
civilized
state
and
inspire
them
with
correct
conception
of
the
power

information
ha
been
recently
received
of
the
appointment
of
a
commissioner
on
the
part
of
his
catholic
majesty
for
running
the
boundary

,
but
none
of
any

for

of
the
claim
of
our
citizen
whose

were
captured
by
the

of

the
effect
of
the
agency
in
the
west
indie
are
not
yet
fully
ascertained
,
but
those
which
have
been
communicated
afford
ground
to
believe
the
measure
will
be
beneficial
.
the
agent
destined
to
reside
in
great
britain
declining
to
accept
the
appointment
,
the
business
ha
consequently
devolved
on
the
minister
of
the
united
state
in
london
,
and
will
command
his
attention
until
a
new
agent
shall
be
appointed
.
after
many
delay
and
disappointment
arising
out
of
the
european
war
,
the
final
arrangement
for
fulfilling
the
engagement
made
to
the
dey
and
regency
of
algiers
will
in
all
present
appearance
be
crowned
with
success
,
but
under
great
,
though
inevitable
,
disadvantage
in
the
pecuniary
transaction
occasioned
by
that
war
,
which
will
render
further
provision
necessary
.
the
actual
liberation
of
all
our
citizen
who
were
prisoner
in
algiers
,
while
it
gratifies
every
feeling
of
heart
,
is
itself
an
earnest
of
a
satisfactory
termination
of
the
whole
negotiation
.
measure
are
in
operation
for
effecting
treaty
with
the
regency
of
tunis
and
tripoli
.
to
an
active
external
commerce
the
protection
of
a
naval
force
is
indispensable
.
this
is
manifest
with
regard
to
war
in
which
a
state
is
itself
a
party
.
but
besides
this
,
it
is
in
our
own
experience
that
the
most
sincere
neutrality
is
not
a
sufficient
guard
against
the
depredation
of
nation
at
war
.
to
secure
respect
to
a
neutral
flag
requires
a
naval
force
organized
and
ready
to
vindicate
it
from
insult
or
aggression
.
this
may
even
prevent
the
necessity
of
going
to
war
by
discouraging
belligerent
power
from
committing
such
violation
of
the
right
of
the
neutral
party
a
may
,
first
or
last
,
leave
no
other
option
.
from
the
best
information
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
it
would
seem
a
if
our
trade
to
the
mediterranean
without
a
protecting
force
will
always
be
insecure
and
our
citizen
exposed
to
the
calamity
from
which
number
of
them
have
but
just
been
relieved
.
these
consideration
invite
the
united
state
to
look
to
the
mean
,
and
to
set
about
the
gradual
creation
of
a
navy
.
the
increasing
progress
of
their
navigation
promise
them
at
no
distant
period
the
requisite
supply
of
sea-men
,
and
their
mean
in
other
respect
favor
the
undertaking
.
it
is
an
encouragement
,
likewise
,
that
their
particular
situation
will
give
weight
and
influence
to
a
moderate
naval
force
in
their
hand
.
will
it
not
,
then
,
be
advisable
to
begin
without
delay
to
provide
and
lay
up
the
material
for
the
building
and
equipping
of
ship
of
war
,
and
to
proceed
in
the
work
by
degree
,
in
proportion
a
our
resource
shall
render
it
practicable
without
inconvenience
,
so
that
a
future
war
of
europe
may
not
find
our
commerce
in
the
same
unprotected
state
in
which
it
wa
found
by
the
present
?
congress
have
repeatedly
,
and
not
without
success
,
directed
their
attention
to
the
encouragement
of
manufacture
.
the
object
is
of
too
much
consequence
not
to
insure
a
continuance
of
their
effort
in
every
way
which
shall
appear
eligible
.

but
where
the
state
of

in
a
country
leaf

hope
that
certain
branch
of
manufacture
will
for
a
great
length
of
time

,
when
these
are
of
a
nature
essential
to
the

exception

ought
our
country
to
remain
in

liable
to
be

?
if
the
necessary
article
should
in
this
mode

not

security
and
independence

compensation

establishment
of
this
sort
,
commensurate
only
with
the
call
of
the
public
service
in
time
of
peace
,
will
in
time
of
war
easily
be
extended
in
proportion
to
the
exigency
of
the
government
,
and
may
even
perhaps
be
made
to
yield
a
surplus
for
the
supply
of
our
citizen
at
large
,
so
a
to
mitigate
the
privation
from
the
interruption
of
their
trade
.
if
adopted
,
the
plan
ought
to
exclude
all
those
branch
which
are
already
,
or
likely
soon
to
be
,
established
in
the
country
,
in
order
that
they
may
be
no
danger
of
interference
with
pursuit
of
individual
industry
.
it
will
not
be
doubted
that
with
reference
either
to
individual
or
national
welfare
agriculture
is
of
primary
importance
.
in
proportion
a
nation
advance
in
population
and
other
circumstance
of
maturity
this
truth
becomes
more
apparent
,
and
render
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
more
and
more
an
object
of
public
patronage
.
institution
for
promoting
it
grow
up
,
supported
by
the
public
purse
;
and
to
what
object
can
it
be
dedicated
with
greater
propriety
?
among
the
mean
which
have
been
employed
to
this
end
none
have
been
attended
with
greater
success
than
the
establishment
of
board
(
composed
of
proper
character
)
charged
with
collecting
and
diffusing
information
,
and
enabled
by
premium
and
small
pecuniary
aid
to
encourage
and
assist
a
spirit
of
discovery
and
improvement
.
this
specie
of
establishment
contributes
doubly
to
the
increase
of
improvement
by
stimulating
to
enterprise
and
experiment
,
and
by
drawing
to
a
common
center
the
result
everywhere
of
individual
skill
and
observation
,
and
spreading
them
thence
over
the
whole
nation
.
experience
accordingly
ha
shewn
that
they
are
very
cheap
instrument
of
immense
national
benefit
.
i
have
heretofore
proposed
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
expediency
of
establishing
a
national
university
and
also
a
military
academy
.
the
desirableness
of
both
these
institution
ha
so
constantly
increased
with
every
new
view
i
have
taken
of
the
subject
that
i
can
not
omit
the
opportunity
of
once
for
all
recalling
your
attention
to
them
.
the
assembly
to
which
i
address
myself
is
too
enlightened
not
to
be
fully
sensible
how
much
a
flourishing
state
of
the
art
and
science
contributes
to
national
prosperity
and
reputation
.
true
it
is
that
our
country
,
much
to
it
honor
,
contains
many
seminary
of
learning
highly
repeatable
and
useful
;
but
the
fund
upon
which
they
rest
are
too
narrow
to
command
the
ablest
professor
in
the
different
department
of
liberal
knowledge
for
the
institution
contemplated
,
though
they
would
be
excellent
auxiliary
.
amongst
the
motif
to
such
an
institution
,
the
assimilation
of
the
principle
,
opinion
,
and
manner
of
our
country-men
by
the
common
education
of
a
portion
of
our
youth
from
every
quarter
well
deserves
attention
.
the
more
homogenous
our
citizen
can
be
made
in
these
particular
the
greater
will
be
our
prospect
of
permanent
union
;
and
a
primary
object
of
such
a
national
institution
should
be
the
education
of
our
youth
in
the
science
of
government
.
in
a
republic
what
specie
of
knowledge
can
be
equally
important
and
what
duty
more
pressing
on
it
legislature
than
to
patronize
a
plan
for
communicating
it
to
those
who
are
to
be
the
future
guardian
of
the
liberty
of
the
country
?
the
institution
of
a
military
academy
is
also
recommended
by
cogent
reason
.
however
pacific
the
general
policy
of
a
nation
may
be
,
it
ought
never
to
be
without
an
adequate
stock
of
military
knowledge
for
emergency
.
the
1st
would
impair
the
energy
of
it
character
,
and
both
would
hazard
it
safety
or
expose
it
to
greater
evil
when
war
could
not
be
avoided
;
besides
that
,
war
might
often
not
depend
upon
it
own
choice
.
in
proportion
a
the
observance
of
pacific
maxim
might
exempt
a
nation
from
the
necessity
of
practicing
the
rule
of
the
military
art
ought
to
be
it
care
in
preserving
and
transmitting
,
by
proper
establishment
,
the
knowledge
of
that
art
.
whatever
argument
may
be
drawn
from
particular
example
superficially
viewed
,
a
thorough
examination
of
the
subject
will
evince
that
the
art
of
war
is
at
once
comprehensive
and
complicated
,
that
it
demand
much
previous
study
,
and
that
the
possession
of
it
in
it
most
improved
and
perfect
state
is
always
of
great
moment
to
the
security
of
a
nation
.
this
,
therefore
,
ought
to
be
a
serious
care
of
every
government
,
and
for
this
purpose
an
academy
where
a
regular
course
of
instruction
is
given
is
an
obvious
expedient
which
different
nation
have
successfully
employed
.
the
compensation
to
the
officer
of
the
united
state
in
various
instance
,
and
in
none
more
than
in
respect
to
the
most
important
station
,
appear
to
call
for
legislative
revision
.
the
consequence
of
a
defective
provision
are
of
serious
import
to
the
government
.
if
private
wealth
is
to
supply
the
defect
of
public
retribution
,
it
will
greatly
contract
the
sphere
within
which
the
selection
of
character
for
office
is
to
be
made
,
and
will
proportionally
diminish
the
probability
of
a
choice
of
men
able
a
well
a
upright
.
besides
that
,
it
should
be
repugnant
to
the
vital
principle
of
our
government
virtually
to
exclude
from
public
trust
talent
and
virtue
unless
accompanied
by
wealth
.
while
in
our
external
relation
some
serious
inconvenience
and
embarrassment
have
been
overcome
and
others
lessened
,
it
is
with
much
pain
and
deep
regret
i
mention
that
circumstance
of
a
very
unwelcome
nature
have
lately
occurred
.
our
trade
ha
suffered
and
is
suffering
extensive
injury
in
the
west
indie
from
the
cruiser
and
agent
of
the
french
republic
,
and
communication
have
been
received
from
it
minister
here
which
indicate
the
danger
of
a
further
disturbance
of
our
commerce
by
it
authority
,
and
which
are
in
other
respect
far
from
agreeable
.
it
ha
been
my
constant
,
sincere
,
and
earnest
wish
,
in
conformity
with
that
of
our
nation
,
to
maintain
cordial
harmony
and
a
perfectly
friendly
understanding
with
that
republic
.
this
wish
remains
unabated
,
and
i
shall
persevere
in
the
endeavor
to
fulfill
it
to
the
utmost
extent
of
what
shall
be
consistent
with
a
just
and
indispensable
regard
to
the
right
and
honor
of
our
country
;
nor
will
i
easily
cease
to
cherish
the
expectation
that
a
spirit
of
justice
,
candor
,
and
friendship
on
the
part
of
the
republic
will
eventually
insure
success
.
in
pursuing
this
course
,
however
,
i
can
not
forget
what
is
due
to
the
character
of
our
government
and
nation
,
or
to
a
full
and
entire
confidence
in
the
good

ardently
expressed

barely
recall
the
subject
to
your
view

harbor

sufficiently
secured

the
situation
in

the
last
time
,

omit
the
occasion
to
congratulate
you

universe

providential
care
may
still
be
extended
