mr.
speaker
,
mr.
president
,
my
colleague
in
the
congress
,
our
distinguished
guest
,
my
fellow
american
:
twenty-five
year
ago
i
sat
here
a
a
freshman
congressman
--
along
with
speaker
albert
--
and
listened
for
the
first
time
to
the
president
address
the
state
of
the
union
.
i
shall
never
forget
that
moment
.
the
senate
,
the
diplomatic
corp
,
the
supreme
court
,
the
cabinet
entered
the
chamber
,
and
then
the
president
of
the
united
state
.
a
all
of
you
are
aware
,
i
had
some
difference
with
president
truman
.
he
had
some
with
me
.
but
i
remember
that
on
that
day
--
the
day
he
addressed
that
joint
session
of
the
newly
elected
republican
80th
congress
,
he
spoke
not
a
a
partisan
,
but
a
president
of
all
the
people-calling
upon
the
congress
to
put
aside
partisan
consideration
in
the
national
interest
.
the
greek-turkish
aid
program
,
the
marshall
plan
,
the
great
foreign
policy
initiative
which
have
been
responsible
for
avoiding
a
world
war
for
over
25
year
were
approved
by
the
80th
congress
,
by
a
bipartisan
majority
of
which
i
wa
proud
to
be
a
part
.
nineteen
hundred
seventy-two
is
now
before
u
.
it
hold
precious
time
in
which
to
accomplish
good
for
the
nation
.
we
must
not
waste
it
.
i
know
the
political
pressure
in
this
session
of
the
congress
will
be
great
.
there
are
more
candidate
for
the
presidency
in
this
chamber
today
than
there
probably
have
been
at
any
one
time
in
the
whole
history
of
the
republic
.
and
there
is
an
honest
difference
of
opinion
,
not
only
between
the
party
,
but
within
each
party
,
on
some
foreign
policy
issue
and
on
some
domestic
policy
issue
.
however
,
there
are
great
national
problem
that
are
so
vital
that
they
transcend
partisanship
.
so
let
u
have
our
debate
.
let
u
have
our
honest
difference
.
but
let
u
join
in
keeping
the
national
interest
first
.
let
u
join
in
making
sure
that
legislation
the
nation
need
doe
not
become
hostage
to
the
political
interest
of
any
party
or
any
person
.
there
is
ample
precedent
,
in
this
election
year
,
for
me
to
present
you
with
a
huge
list
of
new
proposal
,
knowing
full
well
that
there
would
not
be
any
possibility
of
your
passing
them
if
you
worked
night
and
day
.
i
shall
not
do
that
.
i
have
presented
to
the
leader
of
the
congress
today
a
message
of
15,000
word
discussing
in
some
detail
where
the
nation
stand
and
setting
forth
specific
legislative
item
on
which
i
have
asked
the
congress
to
act
.
much
of
this
is
legislation
which
i
proposed
in
1969
,
in
1970
,
and
also
in
the
first
session
of
this
92d
congress
and
on
which
i
feel
it
is
essential
that
action
be
completed
this
year
.
i
am
not
presenting
proposal
which
have
attractive
label
but
no
hope
of
passage
.
i
am
presenting
only
vital
program
which
are
within
the
capacity
of
this
congress
to
enact
,
within
the
capacity
of
the
budget
to
finance
,
and
which
i
believe
should
be
above
partisanship
--
program
which
deal
with
urgent
priority
for
the
nation
,
which
should
and
must
be
the
subject
of
bipartisan
action
by
this
congress
in
the
interest
of
the
country
in
1972
.
when
i
took
the
oath
of
office
on
the
step
of
this
building
just
3
year
ago
today
,
the
nation
wa
ending
one
of
the
most
tortured
decade
in
it
history
.
the
1960
's
were
a
time
of
great
progress
in
many
area
.
but
a
we
all
know
,
they
were
also
time
of
great
agony
--
the
agony
of
war
,
of
inflation
,
of
rapidly
rising
crime
,
of
deteriorating
title
,
of
hope
raised
and
disappointed
,
and
of
anger
and
frustration
that
led
finally
to
violence
and
to
the
worst
civil
disorder
in
a
century
.
i
recall
these
trouble
not
to
point
any
finger
of
blame
.
the
nation
wa
so
torn
in
those
final
year
of
the
sixty
that
many
in
both
party
questioned
whether
america
could
be
governed
at
all
.
the
nation
ha
made
significant
progress
in
these
first
year
of
the
seventy
:
our
city
are
no
longer
engulfed
by
civil
disorder
.
our
college
and
university
have
again
become
place
of
learning
instead
of
battleground
.
a
beginning
ha
been
made
in
preserving
and
protecting
our
environment
.
the
rate
of
increase
in
crime
ha
been
slowed
--
and
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
,
the
one
city
where
the
federal
government
ha
direct
jurisdiction
,
serious
crime
in
1971
wa
actually
reduced
by
13
percent
from
the
year
before
.
most
important
,
because
of
the
beginning
that
have
been
made
,
we
can
say
today
that
this
year
1972
can
be
the
year
in
which
america
may
make
the
greatest
progress
in
25
year
toward
achieving
our
goal
of
being
at
peace
with
all
the
nation
of
the
world
.
a
our
involvement
in
the
war
in
vietnam
come
to
an
end
,
we
must
now
go
on
to
build
a
generation
of
peace
.
to
achieve
that
goal
,
we
must
first
face
realistically
the
need
to
maintain
our
defense
.
in
the
past
3
year
,
we
have
reduced
the
burden
of
arm
.
for
the
first
time
in
20
year
,
spending
on
defense
ha
been
brought
below
spending
on
human
resource
.
a
we
look
to
the
future
,
we
find
encouraging
progress
in
our
negotiation
with
the
soviet
union
on
limitation
of
strategic
arm
.
and
looking
further
into
the
future
,
we
hope
there
can
eventually
be
agreement
on
the
mutual
reduction
of
arm
.
but
until
there
is
such
a
mutual
agreement
,
we
must
maintain
the
strength
necessary
to
deter
war
.
and
that
is
why
,
because
of
rising
research
and
development
cost
,
because
of
increase
in
military
and
civilian
pay
,
because
of
the
need
to
proceed
with
new
weapon
system
,
my
budget
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
will
provide
for
an
increase
in
defense
spending
.
strong
military
defense
are
not
the
enemy
of
peace
;
they
are
the
guardian
of
peace
.
there
could
be
no
more
misguided
set
of
priority
than
one
which
would
tempt
others
by
weakening
america
,
and
thereby
endanger
the
peace
of
the
world
.
in
our
foreign
policy
,
we
have
entered
a
new
era
.
the
world
ha
changed
greatly
in
the
11
year
since
president
john
kennedy
said
in
his
inaugural
address
,
``
...
we
shall
pay
any
price
,
bear
any
burden
,
meet
any
hardship
,
support
any
friend
,
oppose
any
foe
to
assure
the
survival
and
the
success
of
liberty
.
''
our
policy
ha
been
carefully
and
deliberately
adjusted
to
meet
the
new
reality
of
the
new
world
we
live
in
.
we
make
today
only
those
commitment
we
are
able
and
prepared
to
meet
.
our
commitment
to
freedom
remains
strong
and
unshakable
.
but
others
must
bear
their
share
of
the
burden
of
defending
freedom
around
the
world
.
and
so
this
,
then
,
is
our
policy
:
--
we
will
maintain
a
nuclear
deterrent
adequate
to
meet
any
threat
to
the
security
of
the
united
state
or
of
our
ally
.
--
we
will
help
other
nation
develop
the
capability
of
defending
themselves
.
--
we
will
faithfully
honor
all
of
our
treaty
commitment
.
--
we
will
act
to
defend
our
interest
,
whenever
and
wherever
they
are
threatened
anyplace
in
the
world
.
--
but
where
our
interest
or
our
treaty
commitment
are
not
involved
,
our
role
will
be
limited
.
--
we
will
not
intervene
militarily
.
--
but
we
will
use
our
influence
to
prevent
war
.
--
if
war
come
,
we
will
use
our
influence
to
stop
it
.
--
once
it
is
over
,
we
will
do
our
share
in
helping
to
bind
up
the
wound
of
those
who
have
participated
in
it
.
a
you
know
,
i
will
soon
be
visiting
the
people
's
republic
of
china
and
the
soviet
union
.
i
go
there
with
no
illusion
.
we
have
great
difference
with
both
power
.
we
shall
continue
to
have
great
difference
.
but
peace
depends
on
the
ability
of
great
power
to
live
together
on
the
same
planet
despite
their
difference
.
we
would
not
be
true
to
our
obligation
to
generation
yet
unborn
if
we
failed
to
seize
this
moment
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
insure
that
we
will
be
able
to
talk
about
those
difference
,
rather
than
to
fight
about
them
,
in
the
future
.
a
we
look
back
over
this
century
,
let
u
,
in
the
highest
spirit
of
bipartisanship
,
recognize
that
we
can
be
proud
of
our
nation
's
record
in
foreign
affair
.
america
ha
given
more
generously
of
itself
toward
maintaining
freedom
,
preserving
peace
,
alleviating
human
suffering
around
the
globe
,
than
any
nation
ha
ever
done
in
the
history
of
man
.
we
have
fought
four
war
in
this
century
,
but
our
power
ha
never
been
used
to
break
the
peace
,
only
to
keep
it
;
never
been
used
to
destroy
freedom
,
only
to
defend
it
.
we
now
have
within
our
reach
the
goal
of
insuring
that
the
next
generation
can
be
the
first
generation
in
this
century
to
be
spared
the
scourge
of
war
.
turning
to
our
problem
at
home
,
we
are
making
progress
toward
our
goal
of
a
new
prosperity
without
war
.
industrial
production
,
consumer
spending
,
retail
sale
,
personal
income
all
have
been
rising
.
total
employment
,
real
income
are
the
highest
in
history
.
new
home
building
start
this
past
year
reached
the
highest
level
ever
.
business
and
consumer
confidence
have
both
been
rising
.
interest
rate
are
down
.
the
rate
of
inflation
is
down
.
we
can
look
with
confidence
to
1972
a
the
year
when
the
back
of
inflation
will
be
broken
.
now
,
this
a
good
record
,
but
it
is
not
good
enough
--
not
when
we
still
have
an
unemployment
rate
of
6
percent
.
it
is
not
enough
to
point
out
that
this
wa
the
rate
of
the
early
peacetime
year
of
the
sixty
,
or
that
if
the
more
than
2
million
men
released
from
the
armed
force
and
defense-related
industry
were
still
in
their
wartime
job
,
unemployment
would
be
far
lower
.
our
goal
in
this
country
is
full
employment
in
peacetime
.
we
intend
to
meet
that
goal
,
and
we
can
.
the
congress
ha
helped
to
meet
that
goal
by
passing
our
job-creating
tax
program
last
month
.
the
historic
monetary
agreement
,
agreement
that
we
have
reached
with
the
major
european
nation
,
canada
,
and
japan
,
will
help
meet
it
by
providing
new
market
for
american
product
,
new
job
for
american
worker
.
our
budget
will
help
meet
it
by
being
expansionary
without
being
inflationary-a
job-producing
budget
that
will
help
take
up
the
gap
a
the
economy
expands
to
full
employment
.
our
program
to
raise
farm
income
will
help
meet
it
by
helping
to
revitalize
rural
america
,
by
giving
to
america
's
farmer
their
fair
share
of
america
's
increasing
productivity
.
we
also
will
help
meet
our
goal
of
full
employment
in
peacetime
with
a
set
of
major
initiative
to
stimulate
more
imaginative
use
of
america
's
great
capacity
for
technological
advance
,
and
to
direct
it
toward
improving
the
quality
of
life
for
every
american
.
in
reaching
the
moon
,
we
demonstrated
what
miracle
american
technology
is
capable
of
achieving
.
now
the
time
ha
come
to
move
more
deliberately
toward
making
full
use
of
that
technology
here
on
earth
,
of
harnessing
the
wonder
of
science
to
the
service
of
man
.
i
shall
soon
send
to
the
congress
a
special
message
proposing
a
new
program
of
federal
partnership
in
technological
research
and
development
--
with
federal
incentive
to
increase
private
research
,
federally
supported
research
on
project
designed
to
improve
our
everyday
life
in
way
that
will
range
from
improving
mass
transit
to
developing
new
system
of
emergency
health
care
that
could
save
thousand
of
life
annually
.
historically
,
our
superior
technology
,
and
high
productivity
have
made
it
possible
for
american
worker
to
be
the
highest
paid
in
the
world
by
far
,
and
yet
for
our
good
still
to
compete
in
world
market
.
now
we
face
a
new
situation
.
a
other
nation
move
rapidly
forward
in
technology
,
the
answer
to
the
new
competition
is
not
to
build
a
wall
around
america
,
but
rather
to
remain
competitive
by
improving
our
own
technology
still
further
and
by
increasing
productivity
in
american
industry
.
our
new
monetary
and
trade
agreement
will
make
it
possible
for
american
good
to
compete
fairly
in
the
world
's
market
--
but
they
still
must
compete
.
the
new
technology
program
will
put
to
use
the
skill
of
many
highly
trained
american
,
skill
that
might
otherwise
be
wasted
.
it
will
also
meet
the
growing
technological
challenge
from
abroad
,
and
it
will
thus
help
to
create
new
industry
,
a
well
a
creating
more
job
for
america's
worker
in
producing
for
the
world
's
market
.
this
second
session
of
the
92d
congress
already
ha
before
it
more
than
90
major
administration
proposal
which
still
await
action
.
i
have
discussed
these
in
the
extensive
written
message
that
i
have
presented
to
the
congress
today
.
they
include
,
among
others
,
our
program
to
improve
life
for
the
aging
;
to
combat
crime
and
drug
abuse
;
to
improve
health
service
and
to
ensure
that
no
one
will
be
denied
needed
health
care
because
of
inability
to
pay
;
to
protect
worker
'
pension
right
;
to
promote
equal
opportunity
for
member
of
minority
,
and
others
who
have
been
left
behind
;
to
expand
consumer
protection
;
to
improve
the
environment
;
to
revitalize
rural
america
;
to
help
the
city
;
to
launch
new
initiative
in
education
;
to
improve
transportation
,
and
to
put
an
end
to
costly
labor
tie-up
in
transportation
.
the
west
coast
dock
strike
is
a
case
in
point
.
this
nation
can
not
and
will
not
tolerate
that
kind
of
irresponsible
labor
tie-up
in
the
future
.
the
message
also
include
basic
reform
which
are
essential
if
our
structure
of
government
is
to
be
adequate
in
the
decade
ahead
.
they
include
reform
of
our
wasteful
and
outmoded
welfare
system
--
substitution
of
a
new
system
that
provides
work
requirement
and
work
incentive
for
those
who
can
help
themselves
,
income
support
for
those
who
can
not
help
themselves
,
and
fairness
to
the
working
poor
.
they
include
a
$
17
billion
program
of
federal
revenue
sharing
with
the
state
and
locality
a
an
investment
in
their
renewal
,
an
investment
also
of
faith
in
the
american
people
.
they
also
include
a
sweeping
reorganization
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government
so
that
it
will
be
more
efficient
,
more
responsive
,
and
able
to
meet
the
challenge
of
the
decade
ahead
.
one
year
ago
,
standing
in
this
place
,
i
laid
before
the
opening
session
of
this
congress
six
great
goal
.
one
of
these
wa
welfare
reform
.
that
proposal
ha
been
before
the
congress
now
for
nearly
2
1/2
year
.
my
proposal
on
revenue
sharing
,
government
reorganization
,
health
care
,
and
the
environment
have
now
been
before
the
congress
for
nearly
a
year
.
many
of
the
other
major
proposal
that
i
have
referred
to
have
been
here
that
long
or
longer
.
now
,
1971
,
we
can
say
,
wa
a
year
of
consideration
of
these
measure
.
now
let
u
join
in
making
1972
a
year
of
action
on
them
,
action
by
the
congress
,
for
the
nation
and
for
the
people
of
america
.
now
,
in
addition
,
there
is
one
pressing
need
which
i
have
not
previously
covered
,
but
which
must
be
placed
on
the
national
agenda
.
we
long
have
looked
in
this
nation
to
the
local
property
tax
a
the
main
source
of
financing
for
public
primary
and
secondary
education
.
a
a
result
,
soaring
school
cost
,
soaring
property
tax
rate
now
threaten
both
our
community
and
our
school
.
they
threaten
community
because
property
tax
,
which
more
than
doubled
in
the
10
year
from
1960
to
'70
,
have
become
one
of
the
most
oppressive
and
discriminatory
of
all
tax
,
hitting
most
cruelly
at
the
elderly
and
the
retired
;
and
they
threaten
school
,
a
hard-pressed
voter
understandably
reject
new
bond
issue
at
the
poll
.
the
problem
ha
been
given
even
greater
urgency
by
four
recent
court
decision
,
which
have
held
that
the
conventional
method
of
financing
school
through
local
property
tax
is
discriminatory
and
unconstitutional
.
nearly
2
year
ago
,
i
named
a
special
presidential
commission
to
study
the
problem
of
school
finance
,
and
i
also
directed
the
federal
department
to
look
into
the
same
problem
.
we
are
developing
comprehensive
proposal
to
meet
these
problem
.
this
issue
involves
two
complex
and
interrelated
set
of
problem
:
support
of
the
school
and
the
basic
relationship
of
federal
,
state
,
and
local
government
in
any
tax
reform
.
under
the
leadership
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
,
we
are
carefully
reviewing
all
of
the
tax
aspect
,
and
i
have
this
week
enlisted
the
advisory
commission
on
intergovernmental
relation
in
addressing
the
intergovernmental
relation
aspect
.
i
have
asked
this
bipartisan
commission
to
review
our
proposal
for
federal
action
to
cope
with
the
gathering
crisis
of
school
finance
and
property
tax
.
later
in
the
year
,
when
both
commission
have
completed
their
study
,
i
shall
make
my
final
recommendation
for
relieving
the
burden
of
property
tax
and
providing
both
fair
and
adequate
financing
for
our
child
's
education
.
these
recommendation
will
be
revolutionary
.
but
all
these
recommendation
,
however
,
will
be
rooted
in
one
fundamental
principle
with
which
there
can
be
no
compromise
:
local
school
board
must
have
control
over
local
school
.
a
we
look
ahead
over
the
coming
decade
,
vast
new
growth
and
change
are
not
only
certainty
,
they
will
be
the
dominant
reality
of
this
world
,
and
particularly
of
our
life
in
america
.
surveying
the
certainty
of
rapid
change
,
we
can
be
like
a
fallen
rider
caught
in
the
stirrup
--
r
we
can
sit
high
in
the
saddle
,
the
master
of
change
,
directing
it
on
a
course
we
choose
.
the
secret
of
mastering
change
in
today
's
world
is
to
reach
back
to
old
and
proven
principle
,
and
to
adapt
them
with
imagination
and
intelligence
to
the
new
reality
of
a
new
age
.
that
is
what
we
have
done
in
the
proposal
that
i
have
laid
before
the
congress
.
they
are
rooted
in
basic
principle
that
are
a
enduring
a
human
nature
,
a
robust
a
the
american
experience
;
and
they
are
responsive
to
new
condition
.
thus
they
represent
a
spirit
of
change
that
is
truly
renewal
.
a
we
look
back
at
those
old
principle
,
we
find
them
a
timely
a
they
are
timeless
.
we
believe
in
independence
,
and
self-reliance
,
and
the
creative
value
of
the
competitive
spirit
.
we
believe
in
full
and
equal
opportunity
for
all
american
and
in
the
protection
of
individual
right
and
liberty
.
we
believe
in
the
family
a
the
keystone
of
the
community
,
and
in
the
community
a
the
keystone
of
the
nation
.
we
believe
in
compassion
toward
those
in
need
.
we
believe
in
a
system
of
law
,
justice
,
and
order
a
the
basis
of
a
genuinely
free
society
.
we
believe
that
a
person
should
get
what
he
work
for
--
and
that
those
who
can
,
should
work
for
what
they
get
.
we
believe
in
the
capacity
of
people
to
make
their
own
decision
in
their
own
life
,
in
their
own
community
--
and
we
believe
in
their
right
to
make
those
decision
.
in
applying
these
principle
,
we
have
done
so
with
the
full
understanding
that
what
we
seek
in
the
seventy
,
what
our
quest
is
,
is
not
merely
for
more
,
but
for
better
for
a
better
quality
of
life
for
all
american
.
thus
,
for
example
,
we
are
giving
a
new
measure
of
attention
to
cleaning
up
our
air
and
water
,
making
our
surroundings
more
attractive
.
we
are
providing
broader
support
for
the
art
,
helping
stimulate
a
deeper
appreciation
of
what
they
can
contribute
to
the
nation
's
activity
and
to
our
individual
life
.
but
nothing
really
matter
more
to
the
quality
of
our
life
than
the
way
we
treat
one
another
,
than
our
capacity
to
live
respectfully
together
a
a
unified
society
,
with
a
full
,
generous
regard
for
the
right
of
others
and
also
for
the
feeling
of
others
.
a
we
recover
from
the
turmoil
and
violence
of
recent
year
,
a
we
learn
once
again
to
speak
with
one
another
instead
of
shouting
at
one
another
,
we
are
regaining
that
capacity
.
a
is
customary
here
,
on
this
occasion
,
i
have
been
talking
about
program
.
program
are
important
.
but
even
more
important
than
program
is
what
we
are
a
a
nation
--
what
we
mean
a
a
nation
,
to
ourselves
and
to
the
world
.
in
new
york
harbor
stand
one
of
the
most
famous
statue
in
the
world
--
the
statue
of
liberty
,
the
gift
in
1886
of
the
people
of
france
to
the
people
of
the
united
state
.
this
statue
is
more
than
a
landmark
;
it
is
a
symbol
--
a
symbol
of
what
america
ha
meant
to
the
world
.
it
reminds
u
that
what
america
ha
meant
is
not
it
wealth
,
and
not
it
power
,
but
it
spirit
and
purpose
--
a
land
that
enshrines
liberty
and
opportunity
,
and
that
ha
held
out
a
hand
of
welcome
to
million
in
search
of
a
better
and
a
fuller
and
,
above
all
,
a
freer
life
.
the
world
's
hope
poured
into
america
,
along
with
it
people
.
and
those
hope
,
those
dream
,
that
have
been
brought
here
from
every
corner
of
the
world
,
have
become
a
part
of
the
hope
that
we
now
hold
out
to
the
world
.
four
year
from
now
,
america
will
celebrate
the
200th
anniversary
of
it
founding
a
a
nation
.
there
are
those
who
say
that
the
old
spirit
of
'76
is
dead
--
-that
we
no
longer
have
the
strength
of
character
,
the
idealism
,
the
faith
in
our
founding
purpose
that
that
spirit
represents
.
those
who
say
this
do
not
know
america
.
we
have
been
undergoing
self-doubt
and
self-criticism
.
but
these
are
only
the
other
side
of
our
growing
sensitivity
to
the
persistence
of
want
in
the
midst
of
plenty
,
of
our
impatience
with
the
slowness
with
which
age-old
ill
are
being
overcome
.
if
we
were
indifferent
to
the
shortcoming
of
our
society
,
or
complacent
about
our
institution
,
or
blind
to
the
lingering
inequity
--
then
we
would
have
lost
our
way
.
but
the
fact
that
we
have
those
concern
is
evidence
that
our
ideal
,
deep
down
,
are
still
strong
.
indeed
,
they
remind
u
that
what
is
really
best
about
america
is
it
compassion
.
they
remind
u
that
in
the
final
analysis
,
america
is
great
not
because
it
is
strong
,
not
because
it
is
rich
,
but
because
this
is
a
good
country
.
let
u
reject
the
narrow
vision
of
those
who
would
tell
u
that
we
are
evil
because
we
are
not
yet
perfect
,
that
we
are
corrupt
because
we
are
not
yet
pure
,
that
all
the
sweat
and
toil
and
sacrifice
that
have
gone
into
the
building
of
america
were
for
naught
because
the
building
is
not
yet
done
.
let
u
see
that
the
path
we
are
traveling
is
wide
,
with
room
in
it
for
all
of
u
,
and
that
it
direction
is
toward
a
better
nation
and
a
more
peaceful
world
.
never
ha
it
mattered
more
that
we
go
forward
together
.
look
at
this
chamber
.
the
leadership
of
america
is
here
today
--
the
supreme
court
,
the
cabinet
,
the
senate
,
the
house
of
representative
.
together
,
we
hold
the
future
of
the
nation
,
and
the
conscience
of
the
nation
in
our
hand
.
because
this
year
is
an
election
year
,
it
will
be
a
time
of
great
pressure
.
if
we
yield
to
that
pressure
and
fail
to
deal
seriously
with
the
historic
challenge
that
we
face
,
we
will
have
failed
the
trust
of
million
of
american
and
shaken
the
confidence
they
have
a
right
to
place
in
u
,
in
their
government
.
never
ha
a
congress
had
a
greater
opportunity
to
leave
a
legacy
of
a
profound
and
constructive
reform
for
the
nation
than
this
congress
.
if
we
succeed
in
these
task
,
there
will
be
credit
enough
for
all
--
not
only
for
doing
what
is
right
,
but
doing
it
in
the
right
way
,
by
rising
above
partisan
interest
to
serve
the
national
interest
.
and
if
we
fail
,
more
than
any
one
of
u
,
america
will
be
the
loser
.
that
is
why
my
call
upon
the
congress
today
is
for
a
high
statesmanship
,
so
that
in
the
year
to
come
american
will
look
back
and
say
because
it
withstood
the
intense
pressure
of
a
political
year
,
and
achieved
such
great
good
for
the
american
people
and
for
the
future
of
this
nation
,
this
wa
truly
a
great
congress
.
