gentleman
of
the
congress
:
in
fulfilling
at
this
time
the
duty
laid
upon
me
by
the
constitution
of
communicating
to
you
from
time
to
time
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommending
to
your
consideration
such
legislative
measure
a
may
be
judged
necessary
and
expedient
,
i
shall
continue
the
practice
,
which
i
hope
ha
been
acceptable
to
you
,
of
leaving
to
the
report
of
the
several
head
of
the
executive
department
the
elaboration
of
the
detailed
need
of
the
public
service
and
confine
myself
to
those
matter
of
more
general
public
policy
with
which
it
seems
necessary
and
feasible
to
deal
at
the
present
session
of
the
congress
.
i
realize
the
limitation
of
time
under
which
you
will
necessarily
act
at
this
session
and
shall
make
my
suggestion
a
few
a
possible
;
but
there
were
some
thing
left
undone
at
the
last
session
which
there
will
now
be
time
to
complete
and
which
it
seems
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
public
to
do
at
once
.
in
the
first
place
,
it
seems
to
me
imperatively
necessary
that
the
earliest
possible
consideration
and
action
should
be
accorded
the
remaining
measure
of
the
program
of
settlement
and
regulation
which
i
had
occasion
to
recommend
to
you
at
the
close
of
your
last
session
in
view
of
the
public
danger
disclosed
by
the
unaccommodated
difficulty
which
then
existed
,
and
which
still
unhappily
continue
to
exist
,
between
the
railroad
of
the
country
and
their
locomotive
engineer
,
conductor
and
trainman
.
i
then
recommended
:
first
,
immediate
provision
for
the
enlargement
and
administrative
reorganization
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
along
the
line
embodied
in
the
bill
recently
passed
by
the
house
of
representative
and
now
awaiting
action
by
the
senate
;
in
order
that
the
commission
may
be
enabled
to
deal
with
the
many
great
and
various
duty
now
devolving
upon
it
with
a
promptness
and
thoroughness
which
are
,
with
it
present
constitution
and
mean
of
action
,
practically
impossible
.
second
,
the
establishment
of
an
eight-hour
day
a
the
legal
basis
alike
of
work
and
wage
in
the
employment
of
all
railway
employes
who
are
actually
engaged
in
the
work
of
operating
train
in
interstate
transportation
.
third
,
the
authorization
of
the
appointment
by
the
president
of
a
small
body
of
men
to
observe
actual
result
in
experience
of
the
adoption
of
the
eight-hour
day
in
railway
transportation
alike
for
the
men
and
for
the
railroad
.
fourth
,
explicit
approval
by
the
congress
of
the
consideration
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
an
increase
of
freight
rate
to
meet
such
additional
expenditure
by
the
railroad
a
may
have
been
rendered
necessary
by
the
adoption
of
the
eight-hour
day
and
which
have
not
been
offset
by
administrative
readjustment
and
economy
,
should
the
fact
disclosed
justify
the
increase
.
fifth
,
an
amendment
of
the
existing
federal
statute
which
provides
for
the
mediation
,
conciliation
and
arbitration
of
such
controversy
a
the
present
by
adding
to
it
a
provision
that
,
in
case
the
method
of
accommodation
now
provided
for
should
fail
,
a
full
public
investigation
of
the
merit
of
every
such
dispute
shall
be
instituted
and
completed
before
a
strike
or
lockout
may
lawfully
be
attempted
.
and
,
sixth
,
the
lodgment
in
the
hand
of
the
executive
of
the
power
,
in
case
of
military
necessity
,
to
take
control
of
such
portion
and
such
rolling
stock
of
the
railway
of
the
country
a
may
be
required
for
military
use
and
to
operate
them
for
military
purpose
,
with
authority
to
draft
into
the
military
service
of
the
united
state
such
train
crew
and
administrative
official
a
the
circumstance
require
for
their
safe
and
efficient
use
.
the
second
and
third
of
these
recommendation
the
congress
immediately
acted
on
:
it
established
the
eight-hour
day
a
the
legal
basis
of
work
and
wage
in
train
service
and
it
authorized
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
observe
and
report
upon
the
practical
result
,
deeming
these
the
measure
most
immediately
needed
;
but
it
postponed
action
upon
the
other
suggestion
until
an
opportunity
should
be
offered
for
a
more
deliberate
consideration
of
them
.
the
fourth
recommendation
i
do
not
deem
it
necessary
to
renew
.
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
grant
an
increase
of
rate
on
the
ground
referred
to
is
indisputably
clear
and
a
recommendation
by
the
congress
with
regard
to
such
a
matter
might
seem
to
draw
in
question
the
scope
of
the
commission
's
authority
or
it
inclination
to
do
justice
when
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
either
.
the
other
suggestions-the
increase
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
's
membership
and
in
it
facility
for
performing
it
manifold
duty
;
the
provision
for
full
public
investigation
and
assessment
of
industrial
dispute
,
and
the
grant
to
the
executive
of
the
power
to
control
and
operate
the
railway
when
necessary
in
time
of
war
or
other
like
public
necessity-i
now
very
earnestly
renew
.
the
necessity
for
such
legislation
is
manifest
and
pressing
.
those
who
have
entrusted
u
with
the
responsibility
and
duty
of
serving
and
safeguarding
them
in
such
matter
would
find
it
hard
,
i
believe
,
to
excuse
a
failure
to
act
upon
these
grave
matter
or
any
unnecessary
postponement
of
action
upon
them
.
not
only
doe
the
interstate
commerce
commission
now
find
it
practically
impossible
,
with
it
present
membership
and
organization
,
to
perform
it
great
function
promptly
and
thoroughly
,
but
it
is
not
unlikely
that
it
may
presently
be
found
advisable
to
add
to
it
duty
still
others
equally
heavy
and
exacting
.
it
must
first
be
perfected
a
an
administrative
instrument
.
the
country
can
not
and
should
not
consent
to
remain
any
longer
exposed
to
profound
industrial
disturbance
for
lack
of
additional
mean
of
arbitration
and
conciliation
which
the
congress
can
easily
and
promptly
supply
.
and
all
will
agree
that
there
must
be
no
doubt
a
to
the
power
of
the
executive
to
make
immediate
and
uninterrupted
use
of
the
railroad
for
the
concentration
of
the
military
force
of
the
nation
wherever
they
are
needed
and
whenever
they
are
needed
.
this
is
a
program
of
regulation
,
prevention
and
administrative
efficiency
which
argues
it
own
case
in
the
mere
statement
of
it
.
with
regard
to
one
of
it
item
,
the
increase
in
the
efficiency
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
,
the
house
of
representative
ha
already
acted
;
it
action
need
only
the
concurrence
of
the
senate
.
i
would
hesitate
to
recommend
,
and
i
dare
say
the
congress
would
hesitate
to
act
upon
the
suggestion
should
i
make
it
,
that
any
man
in
any
i
occupation
should
be
obliged
by
law
to
continue
in
an
employment
which
he
desired
to
leave
.
to
pas
a
law
which
forbade
or
prevented
the
individual
workman
to
leave
his
work
before
receiving
the
approval
of
society
in
doing
so
would
be
to
adopt
a
new
principle
into
our
jurisprudence
,
which
i
take
it
for
granted
we
are
not
prepared
to
introduce
.
but
the
proposal
that
the
operation
of
the
railway
of
the
country
shall
not
be
stopped
or
interrupted
by
the
concerted
action
of
organized
body
of
men
until
a
public
investigation
shall
have
been
instituted
,
which
shall
make
the
whole
question
at
issue
plain
for
the
judgment
of
the
opinion
of
the
nation
,
is
not
to
propose
any
such
principle
.
it
is
based
upon
the
very
different
principle
that
the
concerted
action
of
powerful
body
of
men
shall
not
be
permitted
to
stop
the
industrial
process
of
the
nation
,
at
any
rate
before
the
nation
shall
have
had
an
opportunity
to
acquaint
itself
with
the
merit
of
the
case
a
between
employe
and
employer
,
time
to
form
it
opinion
upon
an
impartial
statement
of
the
merit
,
and
opportunity
to
consider
all
practicable
mean
of
conciliation
or
arbitration
.
i
can
see
nothing
in
that
proposition
but
the
justifiable
safeguarding
by
society
of
the
necessary
process
of
it
very
life
.
there
is
nothing
arbitrary
or
unjust
in
it
unless
it
be
arbitrarily
and
unjustly
done
.
it
can
and
should
be
done
with
a
full
and
scrupulous
regard
for
the
interest
and
liberty
of
all
concerned
a
well
a
for
the
permanent
interest
of
society
itself
.
three
matter
of
capital
importance
await
the
action
of
the
senate
which
have
already
been
acted
upon
by
the
house
of
representative
;
the
bill
which
seek
to
extend
greater
freedom
of
combination
to
those
engaged
in
promoting
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
country
than
is
now
thought
by
some
to
be
legal
under
the
term
of
the
law
against
monopoly
;
the
bill
amending
the
present
organic
law
of
porto
rico
;
and
the
bill
proposing
a
more
thorough
and
systematic
regulation
of
the
expenditure
of
money
in
election
,
commonly
called
the
corrupt
practice
act
.
i
need
not
labor
my
advice
that
these
measure
be
enacted
into
law
.
their
urgency
lie
in
the
manifest
circumstance
which
render
their
adoption
at
this
time
not
only
opportune
but
necessary
.
even
delay
would
seriously
jeopard
the
interest
of
the
country
and
of
the
government
.
immediate
passage
of
the
bill
to
regulate
the
expenditure
of
money
in
election
may
seem
to
be
le
necessary
than
the
immediate
enactment
of
the
other
measure
to
which
i
refer
,
because
at
least
two
year
will
elapse
before
another
election
in
which
federal
office
are
to
be
filled
;
but
it
would
greatly
relieve
the
public
mind
if
this
important
matter
were
dealt
with
while
the
circumstance
and
the
danger
to
the
public
moral
of
the
present
method
of
obtaining
and
spending
campaign
fund
stand
clear
under
recent
observation
,
and
the
method
of
expenditure
can
be
frankly
studied
in
the
light
of
present
experience
;
and
a
delay
would
have
the
further
very
serious
disadvantage
of
postponing
action
until
another
election
wa
at
hand
and
some
special
object
connected
with
it
might
be
thought
to
be
in
the
mind
of
those
who
urged
it
.
action
can
be
taken
now
with
fact
for
guidance
and
without
suspicion
of
partisan
purpose
.
i
shall
not
argue
at
length
the
desirability
of
giving
a
freer
hand
in
the
matter
of
combined
and
concerted
effort
to
those
who
shall
undertake
the
essential
enterprise
of
building
up
our
export
trade
.
that
enterprise
will
presently
,
will
immediately
assume
,
ha
indeed
already
assumed
a
magnitude
unprecedented
in
our
experience
.
we
have
not
the
necessary
instrumentality
for
it
prosecution
;
it
is
deemed
to
be
doubtful
whether
they
could
be
created
upon
an
adequate
scale
under
our
present
law
.
we
should
clear
away
all
legal
obstacle
and
create
a
basis
of
undoubted
law
for
it
which
will
give
freedom
without
permitting
unregulated
license
.
the
thing
must
be
done
now
,
because
the
opportunity
is
here
and
may
escape
u
if
we
hesitate
or
delay
.
the
argument
for
the
proposed
amendment
of
the
organic
law
of
porto
rico
is
brief
and
conclusive
.
the
present
law
governing
the
island
and
regulating
the
right
and
privilege
of
it
people
are
not
just
.
we
have
created
expectation
of
extended
privilege
which
we
have
not
satisfied
.
there
is
uneasiness
among
the
people
of
the
island
and
even
a
suspicious
doubt
with
regard
to
our
intention
concerning
them
which
the
adoption
of
the
pending
measure
would
happily
remove
.
we
do
not
doubt
what
we
wish
to
do
in
any
essential
particular
.
we
ought
to
do
it
at
once
.
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
a
bill
wa
passed
by
the
senate
which
provides
for
the
promotion
of
vocational
and
industrial
education
,
which
is
of
vital
importance
to
the
whole
country
because
it
concern
a
matter
,
too
long
neglected
,
upon
which
the
thorough
industrial
preparation
of
the
country
for
the
critical
year
of
economic
development
immediately
ahead
of
u
in
very
large
measure
depends
.
may
i
not
urge
it
early
and
favorable
consideration
by
the
house
of
representative
and
it
early
enactment
into
law
?
it
contains
plan
which
affect
all
interest
and
all
part
of
the
country
,
and
i
am
sure
that
there
is
no
legislation
now
pending
before
the
congress
whose
passage
the
country
awaits
with
more
thoughtful
approval
or
greater
impatience
to
see
a
great
and
admirable
thing
set
in
the
way
of
being
done
.
there
are
other
matter
already
advanced
to
the
stage
of
conference
between
the
two
house
of
which
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
speak
.
some
practicable
basis
of
agreement
concerning
them
will
no
doubt
be
found
an
action
taken
upon
them
.
inasmuch
a
this
is
,
gentleman
,
probably
the
last
occasion
i
shall
have
to
address
the
sixty-fourth
congress
,
i
hope
that
you
will
permit
me
to
say
with
what
genuine
pleasure
and
satisfaction
i
have
co-operated
with
you
in
the
many
measure
of
constructive
policy
with
which
you
have
enriched
the
legislative
annals
of
the
country
.
it
ha
been
a
privilege
to
labor
in
such
company
.
i
take
the
liberty
of
congratulating
you
upon
the
completion
of
a
record
of
rare
serviceableness
and
distinction
.
