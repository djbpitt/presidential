fellow-citizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representative
:
it
is
some
abatement
of
the
satisfaction
with
which
i
meet
you
on
the
present
occasion
that
,
in
felicitating
you
on
a
continuance
of
the
national
prosperity
generally
,
i
am
not
able
to
add
to
it
information
that
the
indian
hostility
which
have
for
some
time
past
distressed
our
northwestern
frontier
have
terminated
.
you
will
,
i
am
persuaded
,
learn
with
no
le
concern
than
i
communicate
it
that
reiterated
endeavor
toward
effecting
a
pacification
have
hitherto
issued
only
in
new
and
outrageous
proof
of
persevering
hostility
on
the
part
of
the
tribe
with
whom
we
are
in
contest
.
an
earnest
desire
to
procure
tranquillity
to
the
frontier
,
to
stop
the
further
effusion
of
blood
,
to
arrest
the
progress
of
expense
,
to
forward
the
prevalent
wish
of
the
nation
for
peace
ha
led
to
strenuous
effort
through
various
channel
to
accomplish
these
desirable
purpose
;
in
making
which
effort
i
consulted
le
my
own
anticipation
of
the
event
,
or
the
scruple
which
some
consideration
were
calculated
to
inspire
,
than
the
wish
to
find
the
object
attainable
,
or
if
not
attainable
,
to
ascertain
unequivocally
that
such
is
the
case
.
a
detail
of
the
measure
which
have
been
pursued
and
of
their
consequence
,
which
will
be
laid
before
you
,
while
it
will
confirm
to
you
the
want
of
success
thus
far
,
will
,
i
trust
,
evince
that
mean
a
proper
and
a
efficacious
a
could
have
been
devised
have
been
employed
.
the
issue
of
some
of
them
,
indeed
,
is
still
depending
,
but
a
favorable
one
,
though
not
to
be
despaired
of
,
is
not
promised
by
anything
that
ha
yet
happened
.
in
the
course
of
the
attempt
which
have
been
made
some
valuable
citizen
have
fallen
victim
to
their
zeal
for
the
public
service
.
a
sanction
commonly
respected
even
among
savage
ha
been
found
in
this
instance
insufficient
to
protect
from
massacre
the
emissary
of
peace
.
it
will
,
i
presume
,
be
duly
considered
whether
the
occasion
doe
not
call
for
an
exercise
of
liberality
toward
the
family
of
the
deceased
.
it
must
add
to
your
concern
to
be
informed
that
,
besides
the
continuation
of
hostile
appearance
among
the
tribe
north
of
the
ohio
,
some
threatening
symptom
have
of
late
been
revived
among
some
of
those
south
of
it
.
a
part
of
the
cherokee
,
known
by
the
name
of
chickamauga
,
inhabiting
five
village
on
the
tennessee
river
,
have
long
been
in
the
practice
of
committing
depredation
on
the
neighboring
settlement
.
it
wa
hoped
that
the
treaty
of
holston
,
made
with
the
cherokee
nation
in
july
,
1791
,
would
have
prevented
a
repetition
of
such
depredation
;
but
the
event
ha
not
answered
this
hope
.
the
chickamauga
,
aided
by
some
bandit
of
another
tribe
in
their
vicinity
,
have
recently
perpetrated
wanton
and
unprovoked
hostility
upon
the
citizen
of
the
united
state
in
that
quarter
.
the
information
which
ha
been
received
on
this
subject
will
be
laid
before
you
.
hitherto
defensive
precaution
only
have
been
strictly
enjoined
and
observed
.
it
is
not
understood
that
any
breach
of
treaty
or
aggression
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
united
state
or
their
citizen
is
even
alleged
a
a
pretext
for
the
spirit
of
hostility
in
this
quarter
.
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
every
practicable
exertion
ha
been
made
(
pursuant
to
the
provision
by
law
for
that
purpose
)
to
be
prepared
for
the
alternative
of
a
prosecution
of
the
war
in
the
event
of
a
failure
of
pacific
overture
.
a
large
proportion
of
the
troop
authorized
to
be
raised
have
been
recruited
,
though
the
number
is
still
incomplete
,
and
pain
have
been
taken
to
discipline
and
put
them
in
condition
for
the
particular
kind
of
service
to
be
performed
.
a
delay
of
operation
(
besides
being
dictated
by
the
measure
which
were
pursuing
toward
a
pacific
termination
of
the
war
)
ha
been
in
itself
deemed
preferable
to
immature
effort
.
a
statement
from
the
proper
department
with
regard
to
the
number
of
troop
raised
,
and
some
other
point
which
have
been
suggested
,
will
afford
more
precise
information
a
a
guide
to
the
legislative
consultation
,
and
among
other
thing
will
enable
congress
to
judge
whether
some
additional
stimulus
to
the
recruiting
service
may
not
be
advisable
.
in
looking
forward
to
the
future
expense
of
the
operation
which
may
be
found
inevitable
i
derive
consolation
from
the
information
i
receive
that
the
product
of
the
revenue
for
the
present
year
is
likely
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
additional
burthen
on
the
community
for
the
service
of
the
ensuing
year
.
this
,
however
,
will
be
better
ascertained
in
the
course
of
the
session
,
and
it
is
proper
to
add
that
the
information
alluded
to
proceeds
upon
the
supposition
of
no
material
extension
of
the
spirit
of
hostility
.
i
can
not
dismiss
the
subject
of
indian
affair
without
again
recommending
to
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
more
adequate
provision
for
giving
energy
to
the
law
throughout
our
interior
frontier
and
for
restraining
the
commission
of
outrage
upon
the
indian
,
without
which
all
pacific
plan
must
prove
nugatory
.
to
enable
,
by
competent
reward
,
the
employment
of
qualified
and
trusty
person
to
reside
among
them
a
agent
would
also
contribute
to
the
preservation
of
peace
and
good
neighborhood
.
if
in
addition
to
these
expedient
an
eligible
plan
could
be
devised
for
promoting
civilization
among
the
friendly
tribe
and
for
carrying
on
trade
with
them
upon
a
scale
equal
to
their
want
and
under
regulation
calculated
to
protect
them
from
imposition
and
extortion
,
it
influence
in
cementing
their
interest
with
ours
could
not
but
be
considerable
.
the
prosperous
state
of
our
revenue
ha
been
intimated
.
this
would
be
still
more
the
case
were
it
not
for
the
impediment
which
in
some
place
continue
to
embarrass
the
collection
of
the
duty
on
spirit
distilled
within
the
united
state
.
these
impediment
have
lessened
and
are
lessening
in
local
extent
,
and
,
a
applied
to
the
community
at
large
,
the
contentment
with
the
law
appears
to
be
progressive
.
but
symptom
of
increased
opposition
having
lately
manifested
themselves
in
certain
quarter
,
i
judged
a
special
interposition
on
my
part
proper
and
advisable
,
and
under
this
impression
have
issued
a
proclamation
warning
against
all
unlawful
combination
and
proceeding
having
for
their
object
or
tending
to
obstruct
the
operation
of
the
law
in
question
,
and
announcing
that
all
lawful
way
and
mean
would
be
strictly
put
in
execution
for
bringing
to
justice
the
infractors
thereof
and
securing
obedience
thereto
.
measure
have
also
been
taken
for
the
prosecution
of
offender
,
and
congress
may
be
assured
that
nothing
within
constitutional
and
legal
limit
which
may
depend
upon
me
shall
be
wanting
to
assert
and
maintain
the
just
authority
of
the
law
.
in
fulfilling
this
trust
i
shall
count
entirely
upon
the
full
cooperation
of
the
other
department
of
the
government
and
upon
the
zealous
support
of
all
good
citizen
.
i
can
not
forbear
to
bring
again
into
the
view
of
the
legislature
the
subject
of
a
revision
of
the
judiciary
system
.
a
representation
from
the
judge
of
the
supreme
court
,
which
will
be
laid
before
you
,
point
out
some
of
the
inconvenience
that
are
experienced
.
in
the
course
of
the
execution
of
the
law

arise
out
of
the
structure
of
the
system
which
in
some
case
tend
to
relax
their
efficacy
.
a
connected
with
this
subject
,
provision
to
facilitate
the
taking
of
bail
upon
process
out
of
the
court
of
the
united
state
and
a
supplementary
definition
of
offense
against
the
constitution
and
law
of
the
union
and
of
the
punishment
for
such
offense
will
,
it
is
presumed
,
be
found
worthy
of
particular
attention
.
observation
on
the
value
of
peace
with
other
nation
are
unnecessary
.
it
would
be
wise
,
however
,
by
timely
provision
to
guard
against
those
act
of
our
own
citizen
which
might
tend
to
disturb
it
,
and
to
put
ourselves
in
a
condition
to
give
that
satisfaction
to
foreign
nation
which
we
may
sometimes
have
occasion
to
require
from
them
.
i
particularly
recommend
to
your
consideration
the
mean
of
preventing
those
aggression
by
our
citizen
on
the
territory
of
other
nation
,
and
other
infraction
of
the
law
of
nation
,
which
,
furnishing
just
subject
of
complaint
,
might
endanger
our
peace
with
them
;
and
,
in
general
,
the
maintenance
of
a
friendly
intercourse
with
foreign
power
will
be
presented
to
your
attention
by
the
expiration
of
the
law
for
that
purpose
,
which
take
place
,
if
not
renewed
,
at
the
close
of
the
present
session

in
execution
of
the
authority
given
by
the
legislature

have
been
taken
for
engaging
some
artist
from
abroad
to

in

been
made
of
the
requisite
building
,
and
these
are
now
putting
into
proper
condition
for
the
purpose
of
the
establishment
.
there
ha
also
been
a
small
beginning
in
the
coinage
of
half
dime
,
the
want
of

in
circulation
calling
the
first
attention
to

with

principle
of
our
national
coinage
,
a
being
essential
to
their
due
operation
and
to
order
in
our
money
concern
,
will
,
i
doubt
not
,
be
resumed
and
completed

it
is
represented
that
some

against

this

upon

be
found
to
be
the
fact
,
a
full
conviction
of
the
importance
of
facilitating
the
circulation
of

intelligence
and
information
will
,
i
doubt
not
,
lead
to
the
application
of
a
remedy
.
the
adoption
of
a
constitution
for
the
state
of
kentucky
ha
been
notified
to
me
.
the
legislature
will
share
with
me
in
the
satisfaction
which
arises
from
an
event
interesting
to
the
happiness
of
the
part
of
the
nation
to
which
it
relates
and
conducive
to
the
general
order
.
it
is
proper
likewise
to
inform
you
that
since
my
last
communication
on
the
subject
,
and
in
further
execution
of
the
act
severally
making
provision
for
the
public
debt
and
for
the
reduction
thereof
,
three
new
loan
have
been
effected
,
each
for
3,000,000
florin
-
one
at
antwerp

at
the
annual
interest
of
4.5
%

with
an
allowance
of
4
%
in

the
rate
of
these
loan
and
the
circumstance
under
which
they
have
been
made
are
confirmation
of
the
high
state

among

gentleman
of
the
house
of

:
i
entertain
a
strong
hope
that
the
state
of
the
national
finance
is
now
sufficiently
matured
to
enable
you
to
enter
upon
a
systematic
and
effectual
arrangement
for
the
regular
redemption
and
discharge
of
the
public
debt
,
according
to
the
right
which
ha
been
reserved
to
the
government

no
measure
can
be
more
desirable
,
whether
viewed
with
an
eye
to
it
intrinsic
importance
or
to
the
general
sentiment
and
wish
of

provision
is
likewise
requisite
for
the

gentleman
of

of

house
of

i
content
myself
with

expire
during
the
present
session
.
among
these
,
that
which
regulates
trade
and
intercourse
with
the
indian
tribe
will
merit
particular
notice
.
the
result
of
your
common
deliberation
hitherto
will
,
i
trust
,
be
productive
of
solid
and
durable
advantage
to
our
constituent

such
a

by
conciliating
more

more
their
ultimate

will
tend
to
strengthen

confirm
their
attachment
to

constitution
of

upon
which

under
divine
providence
,
materially
depend

their

still
further
to

secure
these
inestimable

there
is
nothing
