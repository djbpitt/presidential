gentleman
of
the
congress
:
in
pursuance
of
my
constitutional
duty
to
``
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
,
''
i
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
on
several
matter
which
ought
,
a
it
seems
to
me
,
particularly
to
engage
the
attention
of
your
honorable
body
,
a
of
all
who
study
the
welfare
and
progress
of
the
nation
.
i
shall
ask
your
indulgence
if
i
venture
to
depart
in
some
degree
from
the
usual
custom
of
setting
before
you
in
formal
review
the
many
matter
which
have
engaged
the
attention
and
called
for
the
action
of
the
several
department
of
the
government
or
which
look
to
them
for
early
treatment
in
the
future
,
because
the
list
is
long
,
very
long
,
and
would
suffer
in
the
abbreviation
to
which
i
should
have
to
subject
it
.
i
shall
submit
to
you
the
report
of
the
head
of
the
several
department
,
in
which
these
subject
are
set
forth
in
careful
detail
,
and
beg
that
they
may
receive
the
thoughtful
attention
of
your
committee
and
of
all
member
of
the
congress
who
may
have
the
leisure
to
study
them
.
their
obvious
importance
,
a
constituting
the
very
substance
of
the
business
of
the
government
,
make
comment
and
emphasis
on
my
part
unnecessary
.
the
country
,
i
am
thankful
to
say
,
is
at
peace
with
all
the
world
,
and
many
happy
manifestation
multiply
about
u
of
a
growing
cordiality
and
sense
of
community
of
interest
among
the
nation
,
foreshadowing
an
age
of
settled
peace
and
good
will
.
more
and
more
readily
each
decade
do
the
nation
manifest
their
willingness
to
bind
themselves
by
solemn
treaty
to
the
process
of
peace
,
the
process
of
frankness
and
fair
concession
.
so
far
the
united
state
ha
stood
at
the
front
of
such
negotiation
.
she
will
,
i
earnestly
hope
and
confidently
believe
,
give
fresh
proof
of
her
sincere
adherence
to
the
cause
of
international
friendship
by
ratifying
the
several
treaty
of
arbitration
awaiting
renewal
by
the
senate
.
in
addition
to
these
,
it
ha
been
the
privilege
of
the
department
of
state
to
gain
the
assent
,
in
principle
,
of
no
le
than
31
nation
,
representing
four-fifths
of
the
population
of
the
world
,
to
the
negotiation
of
treaty
by
which
it
shall
be
agreed
that
whenever
difference
of
interest
or
of
policy
arise
which
can
not
be
resolved
by
the
ordinary
process
of
diplomacy
they
shall
be
publicly
analyzed
,
discussed
,
and
reported
upon
by
a
tribunal
chosen
by
the
party
before
either
nation
determines
it
course
of
action
.
there
is
only
one
possible
standard
by
which
to
determine
controversy
between
the
united
state
and
other
nation
,
and
that
is
com-
pounded
of
these
two
element
:
our
own
honor
and
our
obligation
to
the
peace
of
the
world
.
a
test
so
compounded
ought
easily
to
be
made
to
govern
both
the
establishment
of
new
treaty
obligation
and
the
interpretation
of
those
already
assumed
.
there
is
but
one
cloud
upon
our
horizon
.
that
ha
shown
itself
to
the
south
of
u
,
and
hang
over
mexico
.
there
can
be
no
certain
prospect
of
peace
in
america
until
gen.
huerta
ha
surrendered
his
usurped
authority
in
mexico
;
until
it
is
understood
on
all
hand
,
indeed
,
that
such
pretended
government
will
not
be
countenanced
or
dealt
with
by-the
government
of
the
united
state
.
we
are
the
friend
of
constitutional
government
in
america
;
we
are
more
than
it
friend
,
we
are
it
champion
;
because
in
no
other
way
can
our
neighbor
,
to
whom
we
would
wish
in
every
way
to
make
proof
of
our
friendship
,
work
out
their
own
development
in
peace
and
liberty
.
mexico
ha
no
government
.
the
attempt
to
maintain
one
at
the
city
of
mexico
ha
broken
down
,
and
a
mere
military
despotism
ha
been
set
up
which
ha
hardly
more
than
the
semblance
of
national
authority
.
it
originated
in
the
usurpation
of
victoriano
huerta
,
who
,
after
a
brief
attempt
to
play
the
part
of
constitutional
president
,
ha
at
last
cast
aside
even
the
pretense
of
legal
right
and
declared
himself
dictator
.
a
a
consequence
,
a
condition
of
affair
now
exists
in
mexico
which
ha
made
it
doubtful
whether
even
the
most
elementary
and
fundamental
right
either
of
her
own
people
or
of
the
citizen
of
other
country
resident
within
her
territory
can
long
be
successfully
safeguarded
,
and
which
threatens
,
if
long
continued
,
to
imperil
the
interest
of
peace
,
order
,
and
tolerable
life
in
the
land
immediately
to
the
south
of
u
.
even
if
the
usurper
had
succeeded
in
his
purpose
,
in
despite
of
the
constitution
of
the
republic
and
the
right
of
it
people
,
he
would
have
set
up
nothing
but
a
precarious
and
hateful
power
,
which
could
have
lasted
but
a
little
while
,
and
whose
eventual
downfall
would
have
left
the
country
in
a
more
deplorable
condition
than
ever
.
but
he
ha
not
succeeded
.
he
ha
forfeited
the
respect
and
the
moral
support
even
of
those
who
were
at
one
time
willing
to
see
him
succeed
.
little
by
little
he
ha
been
completely
isolated
.
by
a
little
every
day
his
power
and
prestige
are
crumbling
and
the
collapse
is
not
far
away
.
we
shall
not
,
1
believe
,
be
obliged
to
alter
our
policy
of
watchful
waiting
.
and
then
,
when
the
end
come
,
we
shall
hope
to
see
constitutional
order
restored
in
distressed
mexico
by
the
concert
and
energy
of
such
of
her
leader
a
prefer
the
liberty
of
their
people
to
their
own
ambition
.
i
turn
to
matter
of
domestic
concern
.
you
already
have
under
consideration
a
bill
for
the
reform
of
our
system
of
banking
and
currency
,
for
which
the
country
wait
with
impatience
,
a
for
something
fundamental
to
it
whole
business
life
and
necessary
to
set
credit
free
from
arbitrary
and
artificial
restraint
.
i
need
not
say
how
earnestly
i
hope
for
it
early
enactment
into
law
.
i
take
leave
to
beg
that
the
whole
energy
and
attention
of
the
senate
be
concentrated
upon
it
till
the
matter
is
successfully
disposed
of
.
and
yet
i
feel
that
the
request
is
not
needed-that
the
member
of
that
great
house
need
no
urging
in
this
service
to
the
country
.
i
present
to
you
,
in
addition
,
the
urgent
necessity
that
special
provision
be
made
also
for
facilitating
the
credit
needed
by
the
farmer
of
the
country
.
the
pending
currency
bill
doe
the
farmer
a
great
service
.
it
put
them
upon
an
equal
footinig
with
other
business
men
and
master
of
enterprise
,
a
it
should
;
and
upon
it
passage
they
will
find
themselves
quit
of
many
of
the
difficulty
which
now
hamper
them
in
the
field
of
credit
.
the
farmer
,
of
course
,
ask
and
should
be
given
no
special
privilege
,
such
a
extending
to
them
the
credit
of
the
government
itself
.
what
they
need
and
should
obtain
is
legislation
which
will
make
their
own
abundant
and
substantial
credit
resource
available
a
a
foundation
for
joint
,
concerted
local
action
in
their
own
behalf
in
getting
the
capital
they
must
use
.
it
is
to
this
we
should
now
address
ourselves
.
it
ha
,
singularly
enough
,
come
to
pas
that
we
have
allowed
the
industry
of
our
farm
to
lag
behind
the
other
activity
of
the
country
in
it
development
.
i
need
not
stop
to
tell
you
how
fundamental
to
the
life
of
the
nation
is
the
production
of
it
food
.
our
thought
may
ordinarily
be
concentrated
upon
the
city
and
the
hive
of
industry
,
upon
the
cry
of
the
crowded
market
place
and
the
clangor
of
the
factory
,
but
it
is
from
the
quiet
interspaces
of
the
open
valley
and
the
free
hillside
that
we
draw
the
source
of
life
and
of
prosperity
,
from
the
farm
and
the
ranch
,
from
the
forest
and
the
mine
.
without
these
every
street
would
be
silent
,
every
office
deserted
,
every
factory
fallen
into
disrepair
.
and
yet
the
farmer
doe
not
stand
upon
the
same
footing
with
the
forester
and
the
miner
in
the
market
of
credit
.
he
is
the
servant
of
the
season
.
nature
determines
how
long
he
must
wait
for
his
crop
,
and
will
not
be
hurried
in
her
process
.
he
may
give
his
note
,
but
the
season
of
it
maturity
depends
upon
the
season
when
his
crop
matures
,
lie
at
the
gate
of
the
market
where
his
product
are
sold
.
and
the
security
he
give
is
of
a
character
not
known
in
the
broker
's
office
or
a
familiarly
a
it
might
be
on
the
counter
of
the
banker
.
the
agricultural
department
of
the
government
is
seeking
to
assist
a
never
before
to
make
farming
an
efficient
business
,
of
wide
co-operative
effort
,
in
quick
touch
with
the
market
for
foodstuff
.
the
farmer
and
the
government
will
henceforth
work
together
a
real
partner
in
this
field
,
where
we
now
begin
to
see
our
way
very
clearly
and
where
many
intelligent
plan
are
already
being
put
into
execution
.
the
treasury
of
the
united
state
ha
,
by
a
timely
and
well-considered
distribution
of
it
deposit
,
facilitated
the
moving
of
the
crop
in
the
present
season
and
prevented
the
scarcity
of
available
fund
too
often
experienced
at
such
time
.
but
we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
depend
upon
extraordinary
expedient
.
we
must
add
the
mean
by
which
the
,
farmer
may
make
his
credit
constantly
and
easily
available
and
command
when
he
will
the
capital
by
which
to
support
and
expand
his
business
.
we
lag
behind
many
other
great
country
of
the
modern
world
in
attempting
to
do
this
.
system
of
rural
credit
have
been
studied
and
developed
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
while
we
left
our
farmer
to
shift
for
themselves
in
the
ordinary
money
market
.
you
have
but
to
look
about
you
in
any
rural
district
to
see
the
result
,
the
handicap
and
embarrassment
which
nave
been
put
upon
those
who
produce
our
food
.
conscious
of
this
backwardness
and
neglect
on
our
part
,
the
congress
recently
authorized
the
creation
of
a
special
commission
to
study
the
various
system
of
rural
credit
which
have
been
put
into
operation
in
europe
,
and
this
commission
is
already
prepared
to
report
.
it
report
ought
to
make
it
easier
for
u
to
determine
what
method
will
be
best
suited
to
our
own
farmer
.
i
hope
and
believe
that
the
committee
of
the
senate
and
house
will
address
themselves
to
this
matter
with
the
most
fruitful
result
,
and
i
believe
that
the
study
and
recently
formed
plan
of
the
department
of
agriculture
may
be
made
to
serve
them
very
greatly
in
their
work
of
framing
appropriate
and
adequate
legislation
.
it
would
be
indiscreet
and
presumptuous
in
anyone
to
dogmatize
upon
so
great
and
many-sided
a
question
,
but
i
feel
confident
that
common
counsel
will
produce
the
result
we
must
all
desire
.
turn
from
the
farm
to
the
world
of
business
which
center
in
the
city
and
in
the
factory
,
and
i
think
that
all
thoughtful
observer
will
agree
that
the
immediate
service
we
owe
the
business
community
of
the
country
is
to
prevent
private
monopoly
more
effectually
than
it
ha
yet
been
prevented
.
i
think
it
will
be
easily
agreed
that
we
should
let
the
sherman
anti-trust
law
stand
,
unaltered
,
a
it
is
,
with
it
debatable
ground
about
it
,
but
that
we
should
a
much
a
possible
reduce
the
area
of
that
debatable
ground
by
further
and
more
explicit
legislation
;
and
should
also
supplement
that
great
act
by
legislation
which
will
not
only
clarify
it
but
also
facilitate
it
administration
and
make
it
fairer
to
all
concerned
.
no
doubt
we
shall
all
wish
,
and
the
country
will
expect
,
this
to
be
the
central
subject
of
our
deliberation
during
the
present
session
;
but
it
is
a
subject
so
manysided
and
so
deserving
of
careful
and
discriminating
discussion
that
1
shall
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
upon
it
in
a
special
message
at
a
later
date
than
this
.
it
is
of
capital
importance
that
the
business
men
of
this
country
should
be
relieved
of
all
uncertainty
of
law
with
regard
to
their
enterprise
and
investment
and
a
clear
path
indicated
which
they
can
travel
without
anxiety
.
it
is
a
important
that
they
should
be
relieved
of
embarrassment
and
set
free
to
prosper
a
that
private
monopoly
should
be
destroyed
.
the
way
of
action
should
be
thrown
wide
open
.
i
turn
to
a
subject
which
i
hope
can
be
handled
promptly
and
without
serious
controversy
of
any
kind
.
i
mean
the
method
of
selecting
nominee
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
state
.
i
feel
confident
that
i
do
not
misinterpret
the
wish
or
the
expectation
of
the
country
when
i
urge
the
prompt
enactment
of
legislation
which
will
provide
for
primary
election
throughout
the
country
at
which
the
voter
of
the
several
party
may
choose
their
nominee
for
the
presidency
without
the
intervention
of
nominating
convention
.
i
venture
the
suggestion
that
this
legislation
should
provide
for
the
retention
of
party
convention
,
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
declaring
and
accepting
the
verdict
of
the
primary
and
formulating
the
platform
of
the
party
;
and
i
suggest
that
these
convention
should
consist
not
of
delegate
chosen
for
this
single
purpose
,
but
of
the
nominee
for
congress
,
the
nominee
for
vacant
seat
in
the
senate
of
the
united
state
,
the
senator
whose
term
have
not
yet
closed
,
the
national
committee
,
and
the
candidate
for
the
presidency
themselves
,
in
order
that
platform
may
be
framed
by
those
responsible
to
the
people
for
carrying
them
into
effect
.
these
are
all
matter
of
vital
domestic
concern
,
and
besides
them
,
outside
the
charmed
circle
of
our
own
national
life
in
which
our
affection
command
u
,
a
well
a
our
conscience
,
there
stand
out
our
obligation
toward
our
territory
over
sea
.
here
we
are
trustee
.
porto
rico
,
hawaii
,
the
philippine
,
are
ours
,
indeed
,
but
not
ours
to
do
what
we
please
with
.
such
territory
,
once
regarded
a
mere
possession
,
are
no
longer
to
be
selfishly
exploited
;
they
are
part
of
the
domain
of
public
conscience
and
of
serviceable
and
enlightened
statesmanship
.
we
must
administer
them
for
the
people
who
live
in
them
and
with
the
same
sense
of
responsibility
to
them
a
toward
our
own
people
in
our
domestic
affair
.
no
doubt
we
shall
successfully
enough
bind
porto
rico
and
the
hawaiian
island
to
ourselves
by
tie
of
justice
and
interest
and
affection
,
but
the
performance
of
our
duty
toward
the
philippine
is
a
more
difficult
and
debatable
matter
.
we
can
satisfy
the
obligation
of
generous
justice
toward
the
people
of
porto
rico
by
giving
them
the
ample
and
familiar
right
and
privilege
accorded
our
own
citizen
in
our
own
territory
and
our
obligation
toward
the
people
of
hawaii
by
perfecting
the
provision
for
self-government
already
granted
them
,
but
in
the
philippine
we
must
go
further
.
we
must
hold
steadily
in
view
their
ultimate
independence
,
and
we
must
move
toward
the
time
of
that
independence
a
steadily
a
the
way
can
be
cleared
and
the
foundation
thoughtfully
and
permanently
laid
.
acting
under
the
authority
conferred
upon
the

by
congress

i
have
already

of

membership
of
the
commission
.
i
believe
that
in
this
way
we
shall
make
proof
of
their
capacity
in
counsel
and
their
sense
of
responsibility
in
the
exercise
of
political
power
,
and
that
the
success
of
this
step
will
be
sure
to
clear
our
view
for
the
step
which
are
to
follow
.
step
by
step
we
should
extend
and
perfect
the
system
of
self-government
in
the
island
,
making
test
of
them
and
modifying
them
a
experience
discloses
their
success
and
their
failure
;
that
we
should
more
and
more
put
under
the
control
of
the
native
citizen
of
the
archipelago
the
essential
instrument
of
their
life
,
their
local
instrumentality
of
government
,
their
school
,
all
the
common
interest
of
their
community
,
and
so
by
counsel
and
experience
set
tip
a
government
which
all
the
world
will
see
to
be
suitable
to
a
people
whose
affair
are
under
their
own
control
.
at
last
,
i
hope
and
believe
,
we
are
beginning
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
filipino
people
.
by
their
counsel
and
experience
,
rather
than
by
our
own
,
we
shall
learn
how
best
to
serve
them
and
how
soon
it
will
be
possible
and
wise
to
withdraw
our
supervision
.
let
u
once
find
the
path
and
set
out
with
firm
and
confident
tread
upon
it
and
we
shall
not
wander
from
it
or
linger
upon
it
.
a
duty
face
u
with
regard
to
alaska
which
seems
to
me
very
pressing
and
very
imperative
;
perhaps
i
should
say
a
double
duty
,
for
it
concern
both
the
political
and
the
material
development
of
the
territory
.
the
people
of
alaska
should
be
given
the
full
territorial
form
of
government
,
and
alaska
,
a
a
storehouse
,
should
be
unlocked
.
one
key
to
it
is
a
system
of
railway
.
these
the
government
should
itself
build
and
administer
,
and
the
port
and
terminal
it
should
itself
control
in
the
interest
of
all
who
wish
to
use
them
for
the
service
and
development
of
the
country
and
it
people
.
but
the
construction
of
railway
is
only
the
first
step
;
is
only
thrusting
in
the
key
to
the
storehouse
and
throwing
back
the
lock
and
opening
the
door
.
how
the
tempting
resource
of
the
country
are
to
be
exploited
is
another
matter
,
to
which
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
from
time
to
time
calling
your
attention
,
for
it
is
a
policy
which
must
be
worked
out
by
well-considered
stage
,
not
upon
theory
,
but
upon
line
of
practical
expediency
.
it
is
part
of
our
general
problem
of
conservation
.
we
have
a
freer
hand
in
working
out
the
problem
in
alaska
than
in
the
state
of
the
union
;
and
yet
the
principle
and
object
are
the
same
,
wherever
we
touch
it
.
we
must
use
the
resource
of
the
country
,
not
lock
them
up
.
there
need
be
no
conflict
or
jealousy
a
between
state
and
federal
authority
,
for
there
can
be
no
essential
difference
of
purpose
between
them
.
the
resource
in
question
must
be
used
,
but
not
destroyed
or
wasted
;
used
,
but
not
monopolized
upon
any
narrow
idea
of
individual
right
a
against
the
abiding
interest
of
community
.
that
a
policy
can
be
worked
out
by
conference
and
concession
which
will
release
these
resource
and
yet
not
jeopard
or
dissipate
them
,
i
for
one
have
no
doubt
;
and
it
can
be
done
on
line
of
regulation
which
need
be
no
le
acceptable
to
the
people
and
government
of
the
state
concerned
than
to
the
people
and
government
of
the
nation
at
large
,
whose
heritage
these
resource
are
.
we
must
bend
our
counsel
to
this
end
.
a
common
purpose
ought
to
make
agreement
easy
.
three
or
four
matter
of
special
importance
and
significance
i
beg
,
that
you
will
permit
me
to
mention
in
closing
.
our
bureau
of
mine
ought
to
be
equipped
and
empowered
to
render
even
more
effectual
service
than
it
render
now
in
improving
the
condition
of
mine
labor
and
making
the
mine
more
economically
productive
a
well
a
more
safe
.
this
is
an
all-important
part
of
the
work
of
conservation
;
and
the
conservation
of
human
life
and
energy
lie
even
nearer
to
our
interest
than
the
preservation
from
waste
of
our
material
resource
.
we
owe
it
,
in
mere
justice
to
the
railway
employee
of
the
country
,
to
provide
for
them
a
fair
and
effective
employer
'
liability
act
;
and
a
law
that
we
can
stand
by
in
this
matter
will
be
no
le
to
the
advantage
of
those
who
administer
the
railroad
of
the
country
than
to
the
advantage
of
those
whom
they
employ
.
the
experience
of
a
large
number
of
the
state
abundantly
prof
that
.
we
ought
to
devote
ourselves
to
meeting
pressing
demand
of
plain
justice
like
this
a
earnestly
a
to
the
accomplishment
of
political
and
economic
reform
.
social
justice
come
first
.
law
is
the
machinery
for
it
realization
and
is
vital
only
a
it
express
and
embodies
it
.
an
international
congress
for
the
discussion
of
all
question
that
affect
safety
at
sea
is
now
sitting
in
london
at
the
suggestion
of
our
own
government
.
so
soon
a
the
conclusion
of
that
congress
can
be
learned
and
considered
we
ought
to
address
ourselves
,
among
other
thing
,
to
the
prompt
alleviation
of
the
very
unsafe
,
unjust
,
and
burdensome
condition
which
now
surround
the
employment
of
sailor
and
render
it
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
the
service
of
spirited
and
competent
men
such
a
every
ship
need
if
it
is
to
be
safely
handled
and
brought
to
port
.
may
i
not
express
the
very
real
pleas-are
i
have
experienced
in
co-operating
with
this
congress
and
sharing
with
it
the
labor
of
common
service
to
which
it
ha
devoted
itself
so
unreservedly
during
the
past
seven
month
of
uncomplaining
concentration
upon
the
business
of
legislation
?
surely
it
is
a
proper
and
pertinent
part
of
my
report
on
``
the
state
of
the
union
''
to
express
my
admiration
for
the
diligence
,
the
good
temper
,
and
the
full
comprehension
of
public
duty
which
ha
already
been
manifested
by
both
the
house
;
and
i
hope
that
it
may
not
be
deemed
an
impertinent
intrusion
of
myself
into
the
picture
if
i
say
with
how
much
and
how
constant
satisfaction
i
have
availed
myself
of
the
privilege
of
putting
my
time
and
energy
at
their
disposal
alike
in
counsel
and
in
action
.
