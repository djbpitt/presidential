my
fellow-citizens
:
in
obedience
of
the
mandate
of
my
countryman
i
am
about
to
dedicatemyself
to
their
service
under
the
sanction
of
a
solemn
oath
.
deeply
movedby
the
expression
of
confidence
and
personal
attachment
which
ha
calledme
to
this
service
,
i
am
sure
my
gratitude
can
make
no
better
return
than
the
pledge
i
now
give
before
god
and
these
witness
of
unreserved
andcomplete
devotion
to
the
interest
and
welfare
of
those
who
have
honoredme
.
i
deem
it
fitting
on
this
occasion
,
while
indicating
the
opinion
i
holdconcerning
public
question
of
present
importance
,
to
also
briefly
referto
the
existence
of
certain
condition
and
tendency
among
our
peoplewhich
seem
to
menace
the
integrity
and
usefulness
of
their
government
.
while
every
american
citizen
must
contemplate
with
the
utmost
prideand
enthusiasm
the
growth
and
expansion
of
our
country
,
the
sufficiencyof
our
institution
to
stand
against
the
rudest
shock
of
violence
,
thewonderful
thrift
and
enterprise
of
our
people
,
and
the
demonstrated
superiorityof
our
free
government
,
it
behooves
u
to
constantly
watch
for
every
symptomof
insidious
infirmity
that
threatens
our
national
vigor
.
the
strong
man
who
in
the
confidence
of
sturdy
health
court
the
sternestactivities
of
life
and
rejoices
in
the
hardihood
of
constant
labor
maystill
have
lurking
near
his
vitals
the
unheeded
disease
that
doom
himto
sudden
collapse
.
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
,
our
stupendous
achievement
a
a
people
andour
country's
robust
strength
have
given
rise
to
heedlessness
of
thoselaws
governing
our
national
health
which
we
can
no
more
evade
than
humanlife
can
escape
the
law
of
god
and
nature
.
manifestly
nothing
is
more
vital
to
our
supremacy
a
a
nation
and
tothe
beneficent
purpose
of
our
government
than
a
sound
and
stable
currency.its
exposure
to
degradation
should
at
once
arouse
to
activity
the
mostenlightened
statesmanship
,
and
the
danger
of
depreciation
in
the
purchasingpower
of
the
wage
paid
to
toil
should
furnish
the
strongest
incentiveto
prompt
and
conservative
precaution
.
in
dealing
with
our
present
embarrassing
situation
a
related
to
thissubject
we
will
be
wise
if
we
temper
our
confidence
and
faith
in
our
nationalstrength
and
resource
with
the
frank
concession
that
even
these
will
notpermit
u
to
defy
with
impunity
the
inexorable
law
of
finance
and
trade.at
the
same
time
,
in
our
effort
to
adjust
difference
of
opinion
we
shouldbe
free
from
intolerance
or
passion
,
and
our
judgment
should
be
unmovedby
alluring
phrase
and
unvexed
by
selfish
interest
.
i
am
confident
that
such
an
approach
to
the
subject
will
result
in
prudentand
effective
remedial
legislation
.
in
the
meantime
,
so
far
a
the
executivebranch
of
the
government
can
intervene
,
none
of
the
power
with
which
itis
invested
will
be
withheld
when
their
exercise
is
deemed
necessary
tomaintain
our
national
credit
or
avert
financial
disaster
.
closely
related
to
the
exaggerated
confidence
in
our
country
's
greatnesswhich
tends
to
a
disregard
of
the
rule

national
safety
,

i
refer
to
the
prevalence
of
a
popular
dispositionto

and

.
the
verdict
of
our
voter
which
condemned
the
injustice
of
maintainingprotection
for
protection
's
sake
enjoins
upon
the
people
's
servant
theduty
of
exposing
and
destroying
the
brood
of
kindred
evil
which
are
theunwholesome
progeny
of
paternalism
.
this
is
the
bane
of
republican
institutionsand
the
constant
peril
of
our
government
by
the
people
.
it
degrades
tothe
purpose
of
wily
craft
the
plan
of
rule
our
father
established
andbequeathed
to
u
a
an
object
of
our
love
and
veneration
.
it
pervert
thepatriotic
sentiment
of
our
countryman
and
tempts
them
to
pitiful
calculationof
the
sordid
gain
to
be
derived
from
their
government
's
maintenance
.
itundermines
the
self-reliance
of
our
people
and
substitute
in
it
placedependence
upon
governmental
favoritism
.
it
stifle
the
spirit
of
trueamericanism
and
stupefies
every
ennobling
trait
of
american
citizenship
.
the
lesson
of
paternalism
ought
to
be
unlearned
and
the
better
lessontaught
that
while
the
people
should
patriotically
and
cheerfully
supporttheir
government
it
function
do
not
include
the
support
of
the
people
.
the
acceptance
of
this
principle
lead
to
a
refusal
of
bounty
andsubsidies
,
which
burden
the
labor
and
thrift
of
a
portion
of
our
citizensto
aid
ill-advised
or
languishing
enterprise
in
which
they
have
no
concern.it
lead
also
to
a
challenge
of
wild
and
reckless
pension
expenditure
,
which
overleaps
the
bound
of
grateful
recognition
of

serviceand
prostitute
to
vicious
us
the
people

prompt
and
generous
impulseto

.
every
thoughtful
american
must
realize
the
importance
of
checking
atits
beginning
any
tendency
in
public
or
private
station
to
regard
frugalityand
economy
a
virtue
which
we
may
safely
outgrow
.
the
toleration
of
thisidea
result
in
the
waste
of
the
people's
money
by
their
chosen
servantsand
encourages
prodigality
and
extravagance
in
the
home
life
of
our
countryman
.
under
our
scheme
of
government
the
waste
of
public
money
is
a
crimeagainst
the
citizen
,
and
the
contempt
of
our
people
for
economy
and
frugalityin
their
personal
affair
deplorably
sap
the
strength
and
sturdiness
ofour
national
character
.
it
is
a
plain
dictate
of
honesty
and
good
government
that
public
expendituresshould
be
limited
by
public
necessity
,
and
that
this
should
be
measuredby
the
rule
of
strict
economy
;
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
frugalityamong
the
people
is
the
best
guaranty
of
a
contented
and
strong
supportof
free
institution
.
one
mode
of
the
misappropriation
of
public
fund
is
avoided
when

,
instead
of
being
the
reward
of
partisan
activity
,
are
awardedto
those
whose
efficiency
promise
a

return
of
work
for
the
compensationpaid
to
them
.
to
secure
the
fitness
and
competency
of
appointee
to
officeand
remove
from
political
action
the
demoralizing
madness
for
spoil
,
civil-service
reform
ha
found
a
place
in
our
public
policy
and
law
.
the
benefitsalready
gained
through
this
instrumentality
and
the
further
usefulnessit
promise
entitle
it
to
the
hearty
support
and
encouragement
of
all
whodesire
to
see
our
public
service
well
performed
or
who
hope
for
the
elevationof
political
sentiment
and
the
purification
of

the
existence
of

aggregation
of
kindred

and
combinationsof
business
interest
formed
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
production
andfixing
price
is
inconsistent
with
the
fair
field
which
ought
to
be
opento
every
independent
activity
.
legitimate
strife
in

should
notbe
superseded
by
an

constitute
conspiraciesagainst

and
in
all
their
phase
they
are

american
sense
of

to
the
extent

the
people
of
the

have
decreed
that
on

day

controlof

in

just

system

taxation

by
the

to
devote
themselves
unremittingly
to
this

while
there
should
be
no
surrender
of

,
our
task
must
be
undertakenwisely
and
without

vindictiveness
.
our
mission
is
not
punishment
,
but
the
rectification
of
wrong
.
if
in
lifting
burden
from
the
daily
lifeof
our
people
we
reduce
inordinate
and
unequal
advantage
too
long
enjoyed
,
this
is
but
a
necessary
incident
of
our
return
to
right
and
justice
.
ifwe
exact
from
unwilling
mind
acquiescence
in
the
theory
of
an
honest
distributionof
the
fund
of
the
governmental
beneficence
treasured
up
for

,
we
butinsist
upon
a
principle
which
underlies

institution
.
when
wetear
aside
the
delusion
and
misconception
which
have
blinded

,
we
but
show
them
how
farthey
have
been
led
away
from
the
path
of
contentment
and
prosperity
.
whenwe
proclaim
that
the
necessity
