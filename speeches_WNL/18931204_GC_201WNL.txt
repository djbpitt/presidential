a
careful
examination
of
the

statement
and
well-supported
recommendation
contained
in
the
report
of
the
head
of
department
,
who
are
chiefly
charged
with
the
executive
work
of
the
government
.
in
an
effort
to
abridge
this
communication
a
much
a
is
consistent
with
it
purpose
i
shall
supplement
a
brief
reference
to
the
content
of
these

the
mention

not
embraced
therein

by
such
recommendation
a
appear
to
be
at
this
particular
time
appropriate
.
while
our
foreign
relation
have
not
at
all
time
during
the
past
year
been
entirely
free
from
perplexity
,
no
embarrassing
situation
remains
that
will
not
yield
to
the
spirit
of
fairness
and
love
of
justice
which
,
joined
with
consistent
firmness
,
characterize
a
truly
american
foreign
policy
.
my
predecessor

accepted
the
office
of
arbitrator
of
the
long-standing
mission
boundary
dispute
,
tendered
to
the
president
by
the
argentine
republic
and
brazil
,
it
ha
been
my
agreeable
duty
to
receive
the
special
envoy
commissioned
by
those
state
to
lay
before
me
evidence
and
argument
in
behalf
of
their
respective
government
.
the
outbreak
of
domestic
hostility
in
the
republic
of
brazil
found
the
united
state
alert
to
watch
the
interest
of
our
citizen
in
that
country
,
with
which
we
carry
on
important
commerce
.
several
vessel
of
our
new
navy
are
now
and
for
some
time
have
been
stationed
at
rio
de

the
struggle
being
between
the
established
government
,
which
control
the
machinery
of
administration
,
and
with
which
we
maintain
friendly
relation
,
and
certain
officer
of
the
navy
employing
the
vessel
of
their
command
in
an
attack
upon
the
national
capital
and
chief
seaport
,
and
lacking
a
it
doe
the
element
of
divided
administration
,
i
have
failed
to
see
that
the
insurgent
can
reasonably
claim
recognition
a
belligerent
.
thus
far
the
position
of
our
government
ha
been
that
of
an
attentive
but
impartial
observer
of
the
unfortunate
conflict
.
emphasizing
our
fixed
policy
of
impartial
neutrality
in
such
a
condition
of
affair
a
now
exists
,
i
deemed
it
necessary
to
disavow
in
a
manner
not
to
be
misunderstood
the
unauthorized
action
of
our
late
naval
commander
in
those
water
in
saluting
the
revolted
brazilian
admiral
,
being
indisposed
to
countenance
an
act
calculated
to
give
gratuitous
sanction
to
the
local
insurrection
.
the
convention
between
our
government
and
chile
having
for
it
object
the
settlement
and
adjustment
of
the
demand
of
the
two
country
against
each
other
ha
been
made
effective
by
he
organization
of
the
claim
commission
provided
for
.
the
two
government
failing
to
agree
upon
the
third
member
of
the
commission
,
the
good
office
of
the
president
of
the
swiss
republic
were
invoked
,
a
provided
in
the
treaty
,
and
the
selection
of
the
swiss
representative
in
this
country
to
complete
the
organization
wa
gratifying
alike
to
the
united
state
and
chile
.
the
vexatious
question
of
so-called
legation
asylum
for
offender
against
the
state
and
it
law
wa
presented
anew
in
chile
by
the
unauthorized
action
of
the
late
united
state
minister
in
receiving
into
his
official
residence
two
person
who
had
just
failed
in
an
attempt
at
revolution
and
against
whom
criminal
charge
were
pending
growing
out
of
a
former
abortive
disturbance
.
the
doctrine
of
asylum
a
applied
to
this
case
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
best
precedent
,
and
when
allowed
tends
to
encourage
sedition
and
strife
.
under
no
circumstance
can
the
representative
of
this
government
be
permitted
,
under
the
ill-defined
fiction
of
extraterritoriality
,
to
interrupt
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
country
to
which
they
are
accredited
.
a
temperate
demand
having
been
made
by
the
chilean
government
for
the
correction
of
this
conduct
in
the
instance
mentioned
,
the
minister
wa
instructed
no
longer
to
harbor
the
offender
.
the
legislation
of
last
year
known
a
the
geary
law
,
requiring
the
registration
of
all
chinese
laborer
entitled
to
residence
in
the
united
state
and
the
deportation
of
all
not
complying
with
the
provision
of
the
act
within
the
time
prescribed
,
met
with
much
opposition
from
chinaman
in
this
country
.
acting
upon
the
advice
of
eminent
counsel
that
the
law
wa
unconstitutional
,
the
great
mass
of
chinese
laborer
,
pending
judicial
inquiry
a
to
it
validity
,
in
good
faith
declined
to
apply
for
the
certificate
required
by
it
provision
.
a
test
case
upon
proceeding
by
habeas
corpus
wa
brought
before
the
supreme
court
,
and
on
may
15
,
1893
,
a
decision
wa
made
by
that
tribunal
sustaining
the
law
.
it
is
believed
that
under
the
recent
amendment
of
the
act
extending
the
time
for
registration
the
chinese
laborer
thereto
entitled
who
desire
to
reside
in
this
country
will
now
avail
themselves
of
the
renewed
privilege
thus
afforded
of
establishing
by
lawful
procedure
their
right
to
remain
,
and
that
thereby
the
necessity
of
enforced
deportation
may
to
a
great
degree
be
avoided
.
it
ha
devolved
upon
the
united
state
minister
at
peking
,
a
dean
of
the
diplomatic
body
,
and
in
the
absence
of
a
representative
of
sweden
and
norway
,
to
press
upon
the
chinese
government
reparation
for
the
recent
murder
of
swedish
missionary
at
sung-pu
.
this
question
is
of
vital
interest
to
all

whose

in

work
in
the

confiscation

the
plain
duty
of

nefarious
traffic
,
impairing
a
it
doe
the
praiseworthy
and
civilizing
effort

costa
rica
ha
lately
testified
it
friendliness
by
surrendering
to
the
united
state
,
in
the
absence
of
a
convention
of
extradition
,
but
upon
duly
submitted
evidence
of
criminality
,
a
noted
fugitive
from
justice
.
it
is
trusted
that
the
negotiation
of
a
treaty
with
that
country
to
meet
recurring
case
of
this
kind
will
soon
be
accomplished
.
in
my
opinion
treaty
for
reciprocal
extradition
should
be
concluded
with
all
those
country
with
which
the
united
state
ha
not
already
conventional
arrangement
of
that
character
.
i
have
deemed
it
fitting
to
express
to
the
government
of
costa
rica
and
colombia
the
kindly
desire
of
the
united
state
to
see
their
pending
boundary
dispute
finally
closed
by
arbitration
in
conformity
with
the
spirit
of
the
treaty
concluded
between
them
some
year
ago
.
our
relation
with
the
french
republic
continue
to
be
intimate
and
cordial

i
sincerely
hope
that
the
extradition
treaty
with
that
country
,
a
amended
by
the
senate
,
will
soon
be
operative
.

the
bering

effective
,
and
it
is
not
doubted
that
great
britain
will
cooperate
freely
with
this
country
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose
.
the
dispute
growing
out
of
the
discriminating
toll
imposed
in
the
welland
canal
upon
cargo
of
cereal
bound
to
and
from
the
lake
port
of
the
united
state

adjusted
by
the
substitution
of
a
more
equitable
schedule
of
charge
,
and
my
predecessor
thereupon
suspended
his
proclamation
imposing
discriminating
toll
upon

transit
through

a
request
for
addition
to
the
list
of
extraditable
offense
covered
by
the
existing
treaty
between
the
two
country
is
under
consideration
.
during
the
past
year
an
american
citizen
employed
in
a
subordinate
commercial
position
in
hayti
,
after
suffering
a
protracted
imprisonment
on
an
unfounded
charge
of
smuggling
,
wa
finally
liberated
on
judicial
examination
.
upon
urgent
representation
to
the
haytian
government
a
suitable
indemnity
wa
paid
to
the
sufferer
.

a
law
of

a
sailing
vessel
,
having
discharged
her
cargo
,
is
refused
clearance
until
the
duty
on

the
hardship
of
this
measure
upon
american
shipowner
,
who
conduct
the
bulk
of
the
carrying
trade
of
that
country
,
ha
been
insisted
on
with
a
view
of
securing
the
removal
of
this
cause
of
complaint

upon
receiving
authentic
information
of
the
firing

authority
of
honduras
,
our
minister
to
that
country
,
under
instruction

protested
against
the
wanton
act

demanded
satisfaction

the
government
of
honduras
,
actuated
by
a
sense
of
justice
and
in
a
spirit
of
the
utmost
friendship
,
promptly
disavowed
the
illegal
conduct
of
it
officer
and
expressed
sincere
regret
for
the
occurrence
.
it
is
confidently
anticipated
that
a
satisfactory
adjustment
will
soon
be
reached
of
the
question
arising
out
of
the
seizure
and
use
of
american
vessel
by
insurgent
in
honduras
and
the
subsequent
denial
by
the
successful
government
of
commercial
privilege

account

for
nearly
half
a
century
ha
been
generally
recognized

cession

ha
been
claimed

the
benevolence
of
our
countryman
,
and
which
constitutes
the
only
independently
sovereign
state
on

west
coast
of

this

ha
suggested
to
the
french
government
it
earnest
concern
lest
territorial
impairment
in
liberia
should
take
place
without
her
unconstrained
consent

our
relation
with

been
extended
to
it
by

but
to
the
ship
of
the
world
in
the
interest
of
civilization
,
is
a
proposition
which
,
in
my
judgment
,
doe
not
admit
of
question

guatemala
ha
also
been
visited
by
the
political
vicissitude
which
have
afflicted
her
central

turkey
complains
that
her
armenian
subject
obtain
citizenship
in
this
country
not
to
identify
themselves
in
good
faith
with
our
people
,
but
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
the
land
of
their
birth
and
there
engaging
in
sedition
.
this
complaint
is
not
wholly
without
foundation
.
a
journal
published
in
this
country
in
the
armenian
language
openly
counsel
it

for
the
subversion
of

authority

announced
it
intention
to
expel
from
it
dominion
armenian
who
have
obtained
naturalization
in
the
united
state
since
1868
.
the
right
to
exclude
any
or
all
class
of
alien
is
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
.
it
is
a
right
asserted
and
,
to
a
limited
extent
,
enforced
by
the
united

,
with
the
sanction
of
our
highest
court
.
there
being
no
naturalization
treaty
between
the
united
state
and
turkey
,
our
minister
at
constantinople
ha
been
instructed
that
,
while
recognizing
the
right
of
that
government
to
enforce
it
declared
policy
against
naturalized
armenian
,
he
is
expected
to
protect
them
from
unnecessary
harshness

treatment

a
restoration
of

intercourse
between

reference
of
the

to

be
a

gratifying
consummation

ratification
by

it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
state
that
the
question
arising
from
our
relation
with
hawaii
have
caused
serious
embarrassment
.
just
prior
to
the
installation
of
the
present
administration
the
existing
government
of
hawaii
had
been
suddenly
overthrown
and
a
treaty
of
annexation
had
been
negotiated
between
the
provisional
government
of
the
island
and
the
united
state
and
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
.
this
treaty
i
withdrew
for
examination
and
dispatched
hon
.
james
h.
blount
,
of
georgia
,
to
honolulu
a
a
special
commissioner
to
make
an
impartial
investigation
of
the
circumstance
attending
the
change
of
government
and
of
all
the
condition
bearing
upon
the
subject
of
the
treaty
.
after
a
thorough
and
exhaustive
examination
mr.
blount
submitted
to
me
his
report
,
showing
beyond
all
question
that
the
constitutional
government
of
hawaii
had
been
subverted
with
the
active
aid
of
our
representative
to
that
government
and
through
the
intimidation
caused
by
the
presence
of
an
armed
naval
force
of
the
united
state
,
which
wa
landed
for
that
purpose
at
the
instance
of
our
minister
.
upon
the
fact
developed
it
seemed
to
me
the
only
honorable
course
for
our
government
to
pursue
wa
to
undo
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
by
those
representing
u
and
to
restore
a
far
a
practicable
the
status
existing
at
the
time
of
our
forcible
intervention
.
with
a
view
of
accomplishing
this
result
within
the
constitutional
limit
of
executive
power
,
and
recognizing
all
our
obligation
and
responsibility
growing
out
of
any
changed
condition
brought
about
by
our
unjustifiable
interference
,
our
present
minister
at
honolulu
ha
received
appropriate
instruction
to
that
end
.
thus
far
no
information
of
the
accomplishment
of
any
definite
result
ha
been
received
from
him
.
additional
advice
are
soon
expected

when
received
they
will
be
promptly
sent
to

,
together
with
all
other
information

,
accompanied
by
a
special
executive
message
fully
detailing
all
the
fact
necessary
to
a
complete
understanding
of
the
case
and
presenting
a
history
of
all
the
material
event
leading
up
to
the
present

the
wish
that
all
controversy
between
the
republic
of
america

the
nation

might
be
settled

,
and
recommended
that
the

in

communicate
this
wish

a
favorable
response

resolution

cooperation
to
the
government

it
affords
me
signal
pleasure
to
lay
this
parliamentary
resolution
before

to
express
my
sincere
gratification
that
the
sentiment
of

thus
authoritatively
manifested
in
favor
of
the
rational
and
peaceable
settlement
of
international
quarrel
by
honorable
resort
to
arbitration

since
the-passage
of

during

occasion

the

been
frightened

a
survey

probably
disclose

sound

abundantly
sufficient

increasing

.
in
the
pursuit
of
this
object
we
should
resolutely
turn
away
from
alluring
and
temporary
expedient
,
determined
to
be
content
with
nothing
le
than
a
lasting
and
comprehensive
financial
plan
.
in
these
circumstance
i
am
convinced
that
a
reasonable
delay
in
dealing
with
this
subject
,
instead
of
being
injurious
,
will
increase
the
probability
of
wise
action
.
the
monetary
conference
which
assembled
at
brussels
upon
our
invitation
wa
adjourned
to
the
30th
day
of
november
of
the
present
year
.
the
consideration
just
stated
and
the
fact
that
a
definite
proposition
from
u
seemed
to
be
expected
upon
the
reassembling
of
the
conference
led
me
to
express
a
willingness
to
have
the
meeting
still
further
postponed
.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
wise
to
give
general
authority
to
the
president
to
invite
other
nation
to
such
a
conference
at
any
time
when
there
should
be
a
fair
prospect
of
accomplishing
an
international
agreement
on
the
subject
of
coinage
.
i
desire
also
to
earnestly
suggest
the
wisdom
of
amending
the
existing
statute
in
regard
to
the
issuance
of
government
bond
.
the
authority
now
vested
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
issue
bond
is
not
a
clear
a
it
should
be
,
and
the
bond
authorized
are
disadvantageous
to
the
government
both
a
to
the
time
of
their
maturity
and
rate
of
interest
.
the
superintendent
of
immigration
,
through
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
,
report
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
there
arrived
at
our
port
440,793
immigrant
.
of
these
,
1,063
were
not
permitted
to
land
under
the
limitation
of
the
law
and
577
were
returned
to
the
country
from
whence
they
came
by
reason
of
their
having
become
public
charge
.
the
total
arrival
were
141,034
le
than
for
the
previous
year
.
the
secretary
in
his
report
give
an
account
of
the
operation
of
the
marine-hospital
service
and
of
the
good
work
done
under
it
supervision
in
preventing
the
entrance
and
spread
of
contagious
disease
.
the
admonition
of
the
last
two
year
touching
our
public
health
and
the
demonstrated
danger
of
the
introduction
of
contagious
disease
from
foreign
port
have
invested
the
subject
of
national
quarantine
with
increased
interest
.
a
more
general
and
harmonious
system
than
now
exists
,
acting
promptly
and
directly
everywhere
and
constantly
operating
by
preventive
mean
to
shield
our
country
from
the
invasion
of
disease
,
and
at
the
same
time
having
due
regard
to
the
right
and
duty
of
local
agency
,
would
,
i
believe
,
add
greatly
to
the
safety
of
our
people
.
the
secretary
of
war
report
that
the
strength
of
the
army
on
the
30th
day
of
september
last
wa
25,778
enlisted
men
and
2,144
officer
.
the
total
expenditure
of
the
department
for
the
year
ending
june
30
,
1893
,
amounted
to
$
51,966,074.89
.
of
this
sum
$
1,992,581.95
wa
for
salary
and
contingent
expense
,
$
23,377,828.35
for
the
support
of
the
military
establishment
,
$
6,077,033.18
for
miscellaneous
object
,
and
518,631.41
for
public
work
.
this
latter
sum
includes
$
15,296,876.46
for
river
and
harbor
improvement
and
$
3,266,141.20
for
fortification
and
other
work
of
defense
.
the
total
enrollment
of
the
militia
of
the
several
state
wa
on
the
31st
of
october
of
the
current
year
112,597
officer
and
enlisted
men
.
the
officer
of
the
army
detailed
for
the
inspection
and
instruction
of
this
reserve
of
our
military
force
report
that
increased
interest
and
marked
progress
are
apparent
in
the
discipline
and
efficiency
of
the
organization
.
neither
indian
outbreak
nor
domestic
violence
have
called
the
army
into
service
during
the
year
,
and
the
only
active
military
duty
required
of
it
ha
been
in
the
department
of
texas
,
where
violation
of
the
neutrality
law
of
the
united
state
and
mexico
were
promptly
and
efficiently
dealt
with
by
the
troop
,
eliciting
the
warm
approval
of
the
civil
and
military
authority
of
both
country
.
the
operation
of
wise
law
and
the
influence
of
civilization
constantly
tending
to
relieve
the
country
from
the
danger
of
indian
hostility
,
together
with
the
increasing
ability
of
the
state
,
through
the
efficiency
of
the
national
guard
organization
,
to
protect
their
citizen
from
domestic
violence
,
lead
to
the
suggestion
that
the
time
is
fast
approaching
when
there
should
be
a
reorganization
of
our
army
on
the
line
of
the
present
necessity
of
the
country
.
this
change
contemplates
neither
increase
in
number
nor
added
expense
,
but
a
redistribution
of
the
force
and
an
encouragement
of
measure
tending
to
greater
efficiency
among
the
men
and
improvement
of
the
service
.
the
adoption
of
battalion
formation
for
infantry
regiment
,
the
strengthening
of
the
artillery
force
,
the
abandonment
of
smaller
and
unnecessary
post
,
and
the
massing
of
the
troop
at
important
and
accessible
station
all
promise
to
promote
the
usefulness
of
the
army
.
in
the
judgment
of
army
officer
,
with
but
few
exception
,
the
operation
of
the
law
forbidding
the
reenlistment
of
men
after
ten
year
'
service
ha
not
proved
it
wisdom
,
and
while
the
argument
that
led
to
it
adoption
were
not
without
merit
the
experience
of
the
year
constrains
me
to
join
in
the
recommendation
for
it
repeal
.
it
is
gratifying
to
note
that
we
have
begun
to
attain
completed
result
in
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
seacoast
defense
and
fortification
entered
upon
eight
year
ago
.
a
large
sum
ha
been
already
expended
,
but
the
cost
of
maintenance
will
be
inconsiderable
a
compared
with
the
expense
of
construction
and
ordnance
.
at
the
end
of
the
current
calendar
year
the
war
department
will
have
nine
12-inch
gun
,
twenty
10-inch
,
and
thirty-four
8-inch
gun
ready
to
be
mounted
on
gun
lift
and
carriage
,
and
seventy-five
12-inch
mortar
.
in
addition
to
the
product
of
the
army
gun
factory
,
now
completed
at
watervliet
,
the
government
ha
contracted
with
private
party
for
the
purchase
of
one
hundred
gun
of
these
caliber
,
the
first
of
which
should
be
delivered
to
the
department
for
test
before
july
1
,
1894
.
the
manufacture
of
heavy
ordnance
keep
pace
with
current
need
,
but
to
render
these
gun
available
for
the
purpose
they
are
designed
to
meet
emplacement
must
be
prepared
for
them
.
progress
ha
been
made
in
this
direction
,
and
it
is
desirable
that
congress
by
adequate
appropriation
should
provide
for
the
uninterrupted
prosecution
of
this
necessary
work
.
after
much
preliminary
work
and
exhaustive
examination
in
accordance
with
the
requirement
of
the
law
,
the
board
appointed
to
select
a
magazine
rifle
of
modern
type
with
which
to
replace
the
obsolete
springfield
rifle
of
the
infantry
service
completed
it
labor
during
the
last
year
,
and
the
work
of
manufacture
is
now
in
progress
at
the
national
armory
at
springfield
.
it
is
confidently
expected
that
by
the
end
of
the
current
year
our
infantry
will
be
supplied
with
a
weapon
equal
to
that
of
the
most
progressive
army
of
the
world
.
the
work
on
the
projected
chickamauga
and
chattanooga
national
military
park
ha
been
prosecuted
with
zeal
and
judgment
,
and
it
opening
will
be
celebrated
during
the
coming
year
.
over
9
square
mile
of
the
chickamauga
battlefield
have
been
acquired
,
25
mile
of
roadway
have
been
constructed
,
and
permanent
tablet
have
been
placed
at
many
historical
point
,
while
the
invitation
to
the
state
to
mark
the
position
of
their
troop
participating
in
the
battle
ha
been
very
generally
accepted
.
the
work
of
locating
and
preserving
the
line
of
battle
at
the
gettysburg
battlefield
is
making
satisfactory
progress
on
the
plan
directed
by
the
last
congress
.
the
report
of
the
military
academy
at
west
point
and
the
several
school
for
special
instruction
of
officer
show
marked
advance
in
the
education
of
the
army
and
a
commendable
ambition
among
it
officer
to
excel
in
the
military
profession
and
to
fit
themselves
for
the
highest
service
to
the
country
.
under
the
supervision
of
adjutant-general
robert
williams
,
lately
retired
,
the
bureau
of
military
information
ha
become
well
established
and
is
performing
a
service
that
will
put
in
possession
of
the
government
in
time
of
war
most
valuable
information
,
and
at
all
time
serve
a
purpose
of
great
utility
in
keeping
the
army
advised
of
the
world's
progress
in
all
matter
pertaining
to
the
art
of
war
.
the
report
of
the
attorney-general
contains
the
usual
summary
of
the
affair
and
proceeding
of
the
department
of
justice
for
the
past
year
,
together
with
certain
recommendation
a
to
needed
legislation
on
various
subject
.
i
can
not
too
heartily
indorse
the
proposition
that
the
fee
system
a
applicable
to
the
compensation
of
united
state
attorney
,
marshal
,
clerk
of
federal
court
,
and
united
state
commissioner
should
be
abolished
with
a
little
delay
a
possible
.
it
is
clearly
in
the
interest
of
the
community
that
the
business
of
the
court
,
both
civil
and
criminal
,
shall
be
a
small
and
a
inexpensively
transacted
a
the
end
of
justice
will
allow
.
the
system
is
therefore
thoroughly
vicious
which
make
the
compensation
of
court
official
depend
upon
the
volume
of
such
business
,
and
thus
creates
a
conflict
between
a
proper
execution
of
the
law
and
private
gain
,
which
can
not
fail
to
be
dangerous
to
the
right
and
freedom
of
the
citizen
and
an
irresistible
temptation
to
the
unjustifiable
expenditure
of
public
fund
.
if
in
addition
to
this
reform
another
wa
inaugurated
which
would
give
to
united
state
commissioner
the
final
disposition
of
petty
offense
within
the
grade
of
misdemeanor
,
especially
those
coming
under
the
internal-revenue
law
,
a
great
advance
would
be
made
toward
a
more
decent
administration
of
the
criminal
law
.
in
my
first
message
to
congress
,
dated
december
8
,
1885
,
i
strongly
recommended
these
change
and
referred
somewhat
at
length
to
the
evil
of
the
present
system
.
since
that
time
the
criminal
business
of
the
federal
court
and
the
expense
attending
it
have
enormously
increased
.
the
number
of
criminal
prosecution
pending
in
the
circuit
and
district
court
of
the
united
state
on
the
1st
day
of
july
,
1885
,
wa
3,808
,
of
which
1,884
were
for
violation
of
the
internal-revenue
law
,
while
the
number
of
such
prosecution
pending
on
the
1st
day
of
july
,
1893
,
wa
9,500
,
of
which
4,200
were
for
violation
of
the
internal-revenue
law
.
the
expense
of
the
united
state
court
,
exclusive
of
judge
'
salary
,
for
the
year
ending
july
1
,
1885
,
wa
$
2,874,733.11
and
for
the
year
ending
july
1
,
1893
,
$
4,528,676.87
.
it
is
therefore
apparent
that
the
reason
given
in
1885
for
a
change
in
the
manner
of
enforcing
the
federal
criminal
law
have
gained
cogency
and
strength
by
lapse
of
time
.
i
also
heartily
join
the
attorney-general
in
recommending
legislation
fixing
degree
of
the
crime
of
murder
within
federal
jurisdiction
,
a
ha
been
done
in
many
of
the
state
;
authorizing
writ
of
error
on
behalf
of
the
government
in
case
where
final
judgment
is
rendered
against
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment
or
against
the
government
upon
any
other
question
arising
before
actual
trial
;
limiting
the
right
of
review
in
case
of
felony
punishable
only
by
fine
and
imprisonment
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
,
and
making
speedy
provision
for
the
construction
of
such
prison
and
reformatory
a
may
be
necessary
for
the
confinement
of
united
state
convict
.
the
report
of
the
postmaster-general
contains
a
detailed
statement
of
the
operation
of
the
post-office
department
during
the
last
fiscal
year
and
much
interesting
information
touching
this
important
branch
of
the
public
service
.
the
business
of
the
mail
indicates
with
absolute
certainty
the
condition
of
the
business
of
the
country
,
and
depression
in
financial
affair
inevitably
and
quickly
reduces
the
postal
revenue
.
therefore
a
larger
discrepancy
than
usual
between
the
post-office
receipt
and
expenditure
is
the
expected
and
unavoidable
result
of
the
distressing
stringency
which
ha
prevailed
throughout
the
country
during
much
of
the
time
covered
by
the
postmaster-general
's
report
.
at
a
date
when
better
time
were
anticipated
it
wa
estimated
by
his
predecessor
that
the
deficiency
on
the
30th
day
of
june
,
1893
,
would
be
but
a
little
over
a
million
and
a
half
dollar
.
it
amounted
,
however
,
to
more
than
five
million
.
at
the
same
time
and
under
the
influence
of
like
anticipation
estimate
were
made
for
the
current
fiscal
year
,
ending
june
30
,
1894
,
which
exhibited
a
surplus
of
revenue
over
expenditure
of
$
872,245.71
;
but
now
,
in
view
of
the
actual
receipt
and
expenditure
during
that
part
of
the
current
fiscal
year
already
expired
,
the
present
postmaster-general
estimate
that
at
it
close
instead
of
a
surplus
there
will
be
a
deficiency
of
nearly
$
8,000,000
.
the
post-office
receipt
for
the
last
fiscal
year
amounted
to
$
75,896,933.16
and
it
expenditure
to
$
81,074,104.90
.
this
post-office
deficiency
would
disappear
or
be
immensely
decreased
if
le
matter
were
carried
free
through
the
mail
,
an
item
of
which
is
upward
of
300
ton
of
seed
and
grain
from
the
agricultural
department
.
the
total
number
of
post-offices
in
the
united
state
on
the
30th
day
of
june
,
1893
,
wa
68,403
,
an
increase
of
1,284
over
the
preceding
year
.
of
these
,
3,360
were
presidential
,
an
increase
in
that
class
of
204
over
the
preceding
year
.
forty-two
free-delivery
office
were
added
during
the
year
to
those
already
existing
,
making
a
total
of
610
city
and
town
provided
with
free
delivery
on
june
30
,
1893
.
ninety-three
other
city
and
town
are
now
entitled
to
this
service
under
the
law
,
but
it
ha
not
been
accorded
them
on
account
of
insufficient
fund
to
meet
the
expense
of
it
establishment
.
i
am
decidedly
of
the
opinion
that
the
provision
of
the
present
law
permit
a
general
an
introduction
of
this
feature
of
mail
service
a
is
necessary
or
justifiable
,
and
that
it
ought
not
to
be
extended
to
smaller
community
than
are
now
designated
.
the
expense
of
free
delivery
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30
,
1894
,
will
be
more
than
$
11,000,000
,
and
under
legislation
now
existing
there
must
be
a
constant
increase
in
this
item
of
expenditure
.
there
were
6,401
addition
to
the
domestic
money-order
office
during
the
last
fiscal
year
,
being
the
largest
increase
in
any
year
since
the
inauguration
of
the
system
.
the
total
number
of
these
office
at
the
close
of
the
year
wa
18,434
.
there
were
13,309,735
money
order
issued
from
these
office
,
being
an
increase
over
the
preceding
year
of
1,240,293
,
and
the
value
of
these
order
amounted
to
$
127,576,433.65
,
an
increase
of
$
7,509,632.58
.
there
were
also
issued
during
the
year
postal
note
amounting
to
$
12,903,076.73
.
during
the
year
195
international
money-order
office
were
added
to
those
already

the

of

give
conclusive
evidence
of
the
value
of
civil-service
reform
when
,
after
an
experience
that
render
his
judgment
on

absolutely
reliable

he
express
the
opinion
that
without
the
benefit
of
this
system
it
would
be
impossible
to
conduct
the
vast
business
intrusted
to
him
.
i
desire
to
commend
a
especially
worthy
of
prompt
attention
the
suggestion
of
the
postmaster-general
relating
to
a
more
sensible
and
business
like
organization
and
a
better
distribution
of
responsibility
in
his
department

the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
contains
a
history
of
the
operation
of
his
department
during
the
past
year
and
exhibit
a
most
gratifying
condition
of
the
personnel
of
our
navy
.
he
present
a
satisfactory
account
of
the
progress
which
ha
been
made
in
the
construction
of
vessel
and
make
a
number
of
recommendation
to
which
attention
is
especially
invited
.
during
the
past
six
month
the
demand
for
cruising
vessel
have
been
many
and
urgent
.
there
have
been
revolution
calling
for

and
brazil

while
the
condition
of

in

ha
required
the
constant
presence
of
one
or
more

.
with
all
these
call
upon
our
navy
it
became
necessary
,
in
order
to
make
up

progress
in

not

constantly
occurring
even
in

the
largest
experience
in

shipbuilding
.
the
most
serious
delay
,
however
,
have
been
in
the
work
upon
armored

the
trouble
ha
been
the
failure
of

difficulty

,
to
have
been
all

satisfactory
promptness

a
a
result
of
the
experience
acquired
by
shipbuilder
and

and
material
men

it
is
believed
that
the
date

ha
at

authorized
the
building
of
one

more

and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
present
an
earnest
plea
for
the
continuance
of
this
plan

he
recommends
the
authorization
of
at

one
battle
ship

six
torpedo

while
i
am
distinctly
in
favor
of
consistently
pursuing
the
policy
we
have
inaugurated
of
building
up
a
thorough
and
efficient
navy
,
i
can
not
refrain
from
the
suggestion
that
the
congress
should
carefully
take
into
account
the
number
of
unfinished
vessel
on
our
hand
and
the
depleted
condition
of
our
treasury
in
considering
the
propriety
of
an
appropriation
at
this
time
to
begin
new
work
.
the
method
of
employing
mechanical
labor
at
navy-yards
through
board
of
labor
and
making
efficiency
the
sole
test
by
which
laborer
are
employed
and
continued
is
producing
the
best
result
,
and
the
secretary
is
earnestly
devoting
himself
to
it
development
.
attention
is
invited
to
the
statement
of
his
report
in
regard
to
the
working
of
the
system

the
secretary
of
the
interior
ha
the
supervision
of
so
many
important
subject
that
his
report
is
of
especial
value
and
interest

the

amounted
to

this
includes

or
the
accumulation
between
the
time
from
which
the
allowance
of
pension
date
and
the
time
of
actually
granting
the
certificate
.
although
the
law
of
1890
permit
pension
for
disability
not
related
to
military
service
,
yet
a
a
requisite

from

performance
of

labor

such
a

to
render
them
unable
to
earn
a
support
.
''
the
execution
of
this
law
in
it
early
stage
doe
not
seem
to
have
been
in
accord
with
it
true
intention
,
but
toward
the
close
of
the
last
administration
an
authoritative
construction
wa
given
to
the
statute
,
and
since
that
time
this
construction
ha
been
followed
.
this
ha
had
the
effect
of
limiting
the
operation
of
the
law
to
it
intended
purpose
.
the
discovery
having
been
made
that
many
name
had
been
put
upon
the
pension
roll
by
mean
of
wholesale
and
gigantic
fraud
,
the
commissioner
suspended
payment
upon
a
number
of
pension
which
seemed
to
be
fraudulent
or
unauthorized
pending
a
complete
examination
,
giving
notice
to
the
pensioner
,
in
order
that
they
might
have
an
opportunity
to
establish
,
if
possible
,
the
justice
of
their
claim
notwithstanding
apparent
invalidity
.
this
,
i
understand
,
is
the
practice
which
ha
for
a
long
time
prevailed
in
the
pension
bureau
;
but
after
entering
upon
these
recent
investigation
the
commissioner
modified
this
rule
so
a
not
to
allow
until
after
a
complete
examination
interference
with
the
payment
of
a
pension
apparently
not
altogether
void
,
but
which
merely
had
been
fixed
at
a
rate
higher
than
that
authorized
by
law
.
i
am
unable
to
understand
why
fraud
in
the
pension
roll
should
not
be
exposed
and
corrected
with
thoroughness
and
vigor
.
every
name
fraudulently
put
upon
these
roll
is
a
wicked
imposition
upon
the
kindly
sentiment
in
which
pension
have
their
origin
;
every
fraudulent
pensioner
ha
become
a
bad
citizen
;
every
false
oath
in
support
of
a
pension
ha
made
perjury
more
common
,
and
false
and
undeserving
pensioner
rob
the
people
not
only
of
their
money
,
but
of
the
patriotic
sentiment
which
the
survivor
of
a
war
fought
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
ought
to
inspire
.
thousand
of
neighborhood
have
their
well-known
fraudulent
pensioner
,
and
recent
development
by
the
bureau
establish
appalling
conspiracy
to
accomplish
pension
fraud
.
by
no
mean
the
least
wrong
done
is
to
brave
and
deserving
pensioner
,
who
certainly
ought
not
to
be
condemned
to
such
association
.
those
who
attempt
in
the
line
of
duty
to
rectify
these
wrong
should
not
be
accused
of
enmity
or
indifference
to
the
claim
of
honest
veteran

the
condition
of
the
indian
and
their
ultimate
fate
are
subject
which
are
related
to
a
sacred
duty
of
the
government
and
which
strongly
appeal
to
the
sense
of
justice
and
the
sympathy
of
our
people
.
our
indian
number
about
248,000
.
most
of
them
are
located
on
161
reservation
,
containing
86,116,531
acre
of
land
.
about
110,000
of
these
indian
have
to
a
large
degree
adopted
civilized
custom
.
land
in
severalty
have
been
allotted
to
many
of
them
.
such
allotment
have
been
made
to
10,000
individual
during
the
last
fiscal
year
,
embracing
about
1,000,000
acre
.
the
number
of
indian
government
school
opened
during
the
year
wa
195
,
an
increase
of
12
over
the
preceding
year
.
of
this
total
170
were
on
reservation
,
of
which
73
were
boarding
school
and
97
were
day
school
.
twenty
boarding
school
and
5
day
school
supported
by
the
government
were
not
located
on
reservation
.
the
total
number
of

child
enrolled
during
the
year

attendant
of
all
school
wa
21,138
,
an
increase
of
1,231
over
the
enrollment
for
the
previous

.
i
am
sure
that
secular
education
and
moral
and
religious
teaching
must
be
important
factor
in
any
effort
to
save
the
indian
and
lead
him
to
civilization
.
i
believe
,
too
,
that
the
relinquishment
of
tribal
relation
and
the
holding
of
land
in
severalty
may
in
favorable
condition
aid
this
consummation
.
it
seems
to
me
,
however
,
that
allotment
of
land
in
severalty
ought
to
be
made
with
great
care
and
circumspection
.
if
hastily
done
,
before
the
indian
know
it
meaning
,
while
yet
he
ha
little
or
no
idea
of
tilling
a
farm
and
no
conception
of
thrift
,
there
is
great
danger
that
a
reservation
life
in
tribal
relation
may
be
exchanged
for
the
pauperism
of
civilization
instead
of
it
independence
and
elevation
.
the
solution
of
the
indian
problem
depends
very
largely
upon
good
administration
.
the
personal
fitness
of
agent
and
their
adaptability
to
the
peculiar
duty
of
caring
for
their
ward
are
of
the
utmost
importance
.
the
law
providing
that
,
except
in
special
case
,
army
officer
shall
be
detailed
a
indian
agent
it
is
hoped
will
prove
a
successful
experiment
.
there
is
danger
of
great
abuse
creeping
into
the
prosecution
of
claim
for
indian
depredation
,
and
i
recommend
that
every
possible
safeguard
be
provided
against
the
enforcement
of
unjust
and
fictitious
claim
of
this
description
.
the
appropriation
on
account
of
the
indian
bureau
for
the
year
ending
june
30
,
1894
,
amount
to
$
7,954,962.99
,
a
decrease
a
compared
with
the
year
preceding
it
of
$
387,131.95
.
the
vast
area
of
land
which
but
a
short
time
ago
constituted
the
public
domain
is
rapidly
falling
into
private
hand
.
it
is
certain
that
in
the
transfer
the
beneficent
intention
of
the
government
to
supply
from
it
domain
home
to
the
industrious
and
worthy
home
seeker
is
often
frustrated
.
though
the
speculator
,
who
stand
with
extortionate
purpose
between
the
land
office
and
those
who
,
with
their
family
,
are
invited
by
the
government
to
settle
on
the
public
land
,
is
a
despicable
character
who
ought
not
to
be
tolerated
,
yet
it
is
difficult
to
thwart
his
scheme
.
the
recent
opening
to
settlement
of
the
land
in
the
cherokee
outlet
,
embracing
an
area
of
6,500,000
acre
,
notwithstanding
the
utmost
care
in
framing
the
regulation
governing
the
selection
of
location
and
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
united
state
troop
,
furnished
an
exhibition
,
though
perhaps
in
a
modified
degree
,
of
the
mad
scramble
,
the
violence
,
and
the
fraudulent
occupation
which
have
accompanied
previous
opening
of
public
land
.
i
concur
with
the
secretary
in
the
belief
that
these
outrageous
incident
can
not
be
entirely
prevented
without
a
change
in
the
law
on
the
subject
,
and
i
hope
his
recommendation
in
that
direction
will
be
favorably
considered
.
i
especially
commend
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
the
statement
contained
in
the
secretary
's
report
concerning
forestry
.
the
time
ha
come
when
efficient
measure
should
be
taken
for
the
preservation
of
our
forest
from
indiscriminate
and
remediless
destruction
.
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
will
be
found
exceedingly
interesting
,
especially
to
that
large
part
of
our
citizen
intimately
concerned
in
agricultural
occupation
.
on
the
7th
day
of
march
,
1893
,
there
were
upon
it
pay
roll
2,430
employee
.
this
number
ha
been
reduced
to
1,850
person
.
in
view
of
a
depleted
public
treasury
and
the
imperative
demand
of
the
people
for
economy
in
the
administration
of
their
government
,
the
secretary
ha
entered
upon
the
task
of
rationally
reducing
expenditure
by
the
elimination
from
the
pay
roll
of
all
person
not
needed
for
an
efficient
conduct
of
the
affair
of
the
department
.
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
year
the
expense
of
the
department
aggregated
$
345,876.76
,
a
against
$
402,012.42
for
the
corresponding
period
of
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30
,
1893
.
the
secretary
make
apparent
his
intention
to
continue
this
rate
of
reduction
by
submitting
estimate
for
the
next
fiscal
year
le
by
$
994,280
than
those
for
the
present
year
.
among
the
head
of
division
in
this
department
the
change
have
been
exceedingly
few
.
three
vacancy
occurring
from
death
and
resignation
have
been
filled
by
the
promotion
of
assistant
in
the
same
division
.
these
promotion
of
experienced
and
faithful
assistant
have
not
only
been
in
the
interest
of
efficient
work
,
but
have
suggested
to
those
in
the
department
who
look
for
retention
and
promotion
that
merit
and
devotion
to
duty
are
their
best
reliance
.
the
amount
appropriated
for
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
for
the
current
fiscal
year
is
$
850,000
.
the
estimate
for
the
ensuing
year
is
$
700,000
.
the
regulation
of
1892
concerning
texas
fever
have
been
enforced
during
the
last
year
and
the
large
stock
yard
of
the
country
have
been
kept
free
from
infection
.
occasional
local
outbreak
have
been
largely
such
a
could
have
been
effectually
guarded
against
by
the
owner
of
the
affected
cattle
.
while
contagious
pleuro-pneumonia
in
cattle
ha
been
eradicated
,
animal
tuberculosis
,
a
disease
widespread
and
more
dangerous
to
human
life
than
pleuro-pneumonia
,
is
still
prevalent
.
investigation
have
been
made
during
the
past
year
a
to
the
mean
of
it
communication
and
the
method
of
it
correct
diagnosis
.
much
progress
ha
been
made
in
this
direction
by
the
study
of
the
division
of
animal
pathology
,
but
work
ought
to
be
extended
,
in
cooperation
with
local
authority
,
until
the
danger
to
human
life
arising
from
this
cause
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
.
the
number
of
animal
arriving
from
canada
during
the
year
and
inspected
by
bureau
officer
wa
462,092
,
and
the
number
from
transatlantic
country
wa
1,297
.
no
contagious
disease
were
found
among
the
imported
animal
.
the
total
number
of
inspection
of
cattle
for
export
during
the
past
fiscal
year
wa
611,542
.
the
export
show
a
falling
off
of
about
25
per
cent
from
the
preceding
year
,
the
decrease
occurring
entirely
in
the
last
half
of
the
year
.
this
suggests
that
the
falling
off
may
have
been
largely
due
to
an
increase
in
the
price
of
american
export
cattle
.
during
the
year
ending
june
30
,
1893
,
export
of
inspected
pork
aggregated
10,677,410
pound
,
a
against
38,152,874
pound
for
the
preceding
year
.
the
falling
off
in
this
export
wa
not
confined
,
however
,
to
inspected
pork
,
the
total
quantity
exported
for
1892
being
665,490,616
pound
,
while
in
1893
it
wa
only
527,308,695
pound
.
i
join
the
secretary
in
recommending
that
hereafter
each
applicant
for
the
position
of
inspector
or
assistant
inspector
in
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
be
required
,
a
a
condition
precedent
to
his
appointment
,
to
exhibit
to
the
united
state
civil
service
commission
his
diploma
from
an
established
,
regular
,
and
reputable
veterinary
college
,
and
that
this
be
supplemented
by
such
an
examination
in
veterinary
science
a
the
commission
may
prescribe
.
the
export
of
agricultural
product
from
the
united
state
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30
,
1892
,
attained
the
enormous
figure
of
$
800,000,000
,
in
round
number
,
being
78.7
per
cent
of
our
total
export
.
in
the
last
fiscal
year
this
aggregate
wa
greatly
reduced
,
but
nevertheless
reached
615,000,000
,
being
75.1
per
cent
of
all
american
commodity
exported
.
a
review
of
our
agricultural
export
with
special
reference
to
their
destination
will
show
that
in
almost
every
line
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
absorbs
by
far
the
largest
proportion
.
of
cattle
the
total
export
aggregated
in
value
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30
,
1893
,
$
26,000,000
,
of
which
great
britain
took
considerably
over
$
25,000,000
.
of
beef
product
of
all
kind
our
total
export
were
$
28,000,000
,
of
which
great
britain
took
$
24,000,000
.
of
pork
product
the
total
export
were
$
84,000,000
,
of
which
great
britain
took
$
53,000,000
.
in
breadstuff
,
cotton
,
and
minor
product

to
the
same
destination
are
shown
.
the
work
of
the
statistical
division
of
the
department
of
agriculture
deal
with
all
that
relates
to
the
economics
of
farming
.
the
main
purpose
of
it
monthly
report
is
to
keep
the
farmer
informed
a
fully
a
possible
of
all
matter
having
any
influence
upon
the
world
's
market
,
in
which
their
product
find
sale
.
it
publication
relate
especially
to
the
commercial
side
of
farming
.
it
is
therefore
of
profound
importance
and
vital
concern
to
the
farmer
of
the
united
state
,
who
represent
nearly
one-half
of
our
population
,
and
also
of
direct
interest
to
the
whole
country
,
that
the
work
of
this
division
be
efficiently
performed
and
that
the
information
it
ha
gathered
be
promptly
diffused
.
it
is
a
matter
for
congratulation
to
know
that
the
secretary
will
not
spare
any
effort
to
make
this
part
of
his
work
thoroughly
useful
.
in
the
year
1839
the
congress
appropriated
$
1,000
,
to
be
taken
from
the
patent
office
fund
,
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
and
distributing
rare
and
improved
variety
of
seed
and
for
prosecuting
agricultural
investigation
and
procuring
agricultural
statistic
.
from
this
small
beginning
the
seed
division
of
the
department
of
agriculture
ha
grown
to
it
present
unwieldy
and
unjustifiably
extravagant
proportion
.
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
cost
of
seed
purchased
wa
$
66,548.61
.
the
remainder
of
an
appropriation
of
$
135,000
wa
expended
in
putting
them
up
and
distributing
them
.
it
surely
never
could
have
entered
the
mind
of
those
who
first
sanctioned
appropriation
of
public
money
for
the
purchase
of
new
and
improved
variety
of
seed
for
gratuitous
distribution
that
from
this
would
grow
large
appropriation
for
the
purchase
and
distribution
by
member
of
congress
of
ordinary
seed
,
bulb
,
and
cutting
which
are
common
in
all
the
state
and
territory
and
everywhere
easily
obtainable
at
low
price
.
in
each
state
and
territory
an
agricultural
experiment
station
ha
been
established
.
these
station
,
by
their
very
character
and
name
,
are
the
proper
agency
to
experiment
with
and
test
new
variety
of
seed
;
and
yet
this
indiscriminate
and
wasteful
distribution
by
legislation
and
legislator
continues
,
answering
no
purpose
unless
it
be
to
remind
constituent
that
their
representative
are
willing
to
remember
them
with
gratuity
at
public
cost
.
under
the
sanction
of
existing
legislation
there
wa
sent
out
from
the
agricultural
department
during
the
last
fiscal
year
enough
of
cabbage
seed
to
plant
19,200
acre
of
land
,
a
sufficient
quantity
of
bean
to
plant
4,000
acre
,
beet
seed
enough
to
plant
2,500
acre
,
sweet
corn
enough
to
plant
7,800
acre
,
sufficient
cucumber
seed
to
cover
2,025
acre
with
vine
,
and
enough
muskmelon
and
watermelon
seed
to
plant
2,675
acre
.
the
total
quantity
of
flower
and
vegetable
seed
thus
distributed
wa
contained
in
more
than
9,000,000
package
,
and
they
were
sufficient
if
planted
to
cover
89,596
acre
of
land
.
in
view
of
these
fact
this
enormous
expenditure
without
legitimate
return
of
benefit
ought
to
be
abolished
.
anticipating
a
consummation
so
manifestly
in
the
interest
of
good
administration
,
more
than
$
100,000
ha
been
stricken
from
the
estimate
made
to
cover
this
object
for
the
year
ending
june
30
,
1895
;
and
the
secretary
recommends
that
the
remaining
$
35,000
of
the
estimate
be
confined
strictly
to
the
purchase
of
new
and
improved
variety
of
seed
,
and
that
these
be
distributed
through
experiment
station
.
thus
the
seed
will
be
tested
,
and
after
the
test
ha
been
completed
by
the
experiment
station
the
propagation
of
the
useful
variety
and
the
rejection
of
the
valueless
may
safely
be
left
to
the
common
sense
of
the
people
.
the
continued
intelligent
execution
of
the
civil-service
law
and
the
increasing
approval
by
the
people
of
it
operation
are
most
gratifying
.
the
recent
extension
of
it
limitation
and
regulation
to
the
employee
at
free-delivery
post-offices
,
which
ha
been
honestly
and
promptly
accomplished
by
the
commission
,
with
the
hearty
cooperation
of
the
postmaster-general
,
is
an
immensely
important
advance
in
the
usefulness
of
the
system
.
i
am
,
if
possible
,
more
than
ever
convinced
of
the
incalculable
benefit
conferred
by
the
civil-service
law
,
not
only
in
it
effect
upon
the
public
service
,
but
also
,
what
is
even
more
important
,
in
it
effect
in
elevating
the
tone
of
political
life
generally
.
the
course
of
civil-service
reform
in
this
country
instructively
and
interestingly
illustrates
how
strong
a
hold
a
movement
gain
upon
our
people
which
ha
underlying
it
a
sentiment
of
justice
and
right
and
which
at
the
same
time
promise
better
administration
of
their
government
.
the
law
embodying
this
reform
found
it
way
to
our
statute
book
more
from
fear
of
the
popular
sentiment
existing
in
it
favor
than
from
any
love
for
the
reform
itself
on
the
part
of
legislator
,
and
it
ha
lived
and
grown
and
flourished
in
spite
of
the
covert
a
well
a
open
hostility
of
spoilsmen
and
notwithstanding
the
querulous
impracticability
of
many
self-constituted
guardian
.
beneath
all
the
vagary
and
sublimated
theory
which
are
attracted
to
it
there
underlies
this
reform
a
sturdy
common-sense
principle
not
only
suited
to
this
mundane
sphere
,
but
whose
application
our
people
are
more
and
more
recognizing
to
be
absolutely
essential
to
the
most
successful
operation
of
their
government
,
if
not
to
it
perpetuity
.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
this
reform
,
a
well
a
with
it
best
enforcement
,
to
oblige
the
commission
to
rely
for
clerical
assistance
upon
clerk
detailed
from
other
department
.
there
ought
not
to
be
such
a
condition
in
any
department
that
clerk
hired
to
do
work
there
can
be
spared
to
habitually
work
at
another
place
,
and
it
doe
not
accord
with
a
sensible
view
of
civil-service
reform
that
person
should
be
employed
on
the
theory
that
their
labor
is
necessary
in
one
department
when
in
point
of
fact
their
service
are
devoted
to
entirely
different
work
in
another
department
.
i
earnestly
urge
that
the
clerk
necessary
to
carry
on
the
work
of
the
commission
be
regularly
put
upon
it
roster
and
that
the
system
of
obliging
the
commissioner
to
rely
upon
the
service
of
clerk
belonging
to
other
department
be
discontinued
.
this
ought
not
to
increase
the
expense
to
the
government
,
while
it
would
certainly
be
more
consistent
and
add
greatly
to
the
efficiency
of
the
commission
.
economy
in
public
expenditure
is
a
duty
that
can
not
innocently
be
neglected
by
those
intrusted
with
the
control
of
money
drawn
from
the
people
for
public
us
.
it
must
be
confessed
that
our
apparently
endless
resource
,
the
familiarity
of
our
people
with
immense
accumulation
of
wealth
,
the
growing
sentiment
among
them
that
the
expenditure
of
public
money
should
in
some
manner
be
to
their
immediate
and
personal
advantage
,
the
indirect
and
almost
stealthy
manner
in
which
a
large
part
of
our
tax
is
exacted
,
and
a
degenerated
sense
of
official
accountability
have
led
to
growing
extravagance
in
governmental
appropriation
.
at
this
time
,
when
a
depleted
public
treasury
confronts
u
,
when
many
of
our
people
are
engaged
in
a
hard
struggle
for
the
necessary
of
life
,
and
when
enforced
economy
is
pressing
upon
the
great
mass
of
our
countryman
,
i
desire
to
urge
with
all
the
earnestness
at
my
command
that
congressional
legislation
be
so
limited
by
strict
economy
a
to
exhibit
an
appreciation
of
the
condition
of
the
treasury
and
a
sympathy
with
the
straitened
circumstance
of
our
fellow-citizens
.
the
duty
of
public
economy
is
also
of
immense
importance
in
it
intimate
and
necessary
relation
to
the
task
now
in
hand
of
providing
revenue
to
meet
government
expenditure
and
yet
reducing
the
people
's
burden
of
federal
taxation
.
after
a
hard
struggle
tariff
reform
is
directly
before
u
.
nothing
so
important
claim
our
attention
and
nothing
so
clearly
present
itself
a
both
an
opportunity
and
a
duty
--
an
opportunity
to
deserve
the
gratitude
of
our
fellow-citizens
and
a
duty
imposed
upon
u
by
our
oft-repeated
profession
and
by
the
emphatic
mandate
of
the
people
.
after
full
discussion
our
countryman
have
spoken
in
favor
of
this
reform
,
and
they
have
confided
the
work
of
it
accomplishment
to
the
hand
of
those
who
are
solemnly
pledged
to
it
.
if
there
is
anything
in
the
theory
of
a
representation
in
public
place
of
the
people
and
their
desire
,
if
public
officer
are
really
the
servant
of
the
people
,
and
if
political
promise
and
profession
have
any
binding
force
,
our
failure
to
give
the
relief
so
long
awaited
will
be
sheer
recreancy
.
nothing
should
intervene
to
distract
our
attention
or
disturb
our
effort
until
this
reform
is
accomplished
by
wise
and
careful
legislation
.
while
we
should
stanchly
adhere
to
the
principle
that
only
the
necessity
of
revenue
justifies
the
imposition
of
tariff
duty
and
other
federal
taxation
and
that
they
should
be
limited
by
strict
economy
,
we
can
not
close
our
eye
to
the
fact
that
condition
have
grown
up
among
u
which
in
justice
and
fairness
call
for
discriminating
care
in
the
distribution
of
such
duty
and
taxation
a
the
emergency
of
our
government
actually
demand
.
manifestly
if
we
are
to
aid
the
people
directly
through
tariff
reform
,
one
of
it
most
obvious
feature
should
be
a
reduction
in
present
tariff
charge
upon
the
necessary
of
life
.
the
benefit
of
such
a
reduction
would
be
palpable
and
substantial
,
seen
and
felt
by
thousand
who
would
be
better
fed
and
better
clothed
and
better
sheltered
.
these
gift
should
be
the
willing
benefaction
of
a
government
whose
highest
function
is
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
the
people
.
not
le
closely
related
to
our
people
's
prosperity
and
well-being
is
the
removal
of
restriction
upon
the
importation
of
the
raw
material
necessary
to
our
manufacture
.
the
world
should
be
open
to
our
national
ingenuity
and
enterprise
.
this
can
not
be
while
federal
legislation
through
the
imposition
of
high
tariff
forbids
to
american
manufacturer
a
cheap
material
a
those
used
by
their
competitor
.
it
is
quite
obvious
that
the
.enhancement
of
the
price
of
our
manufactured
product
resulting
from
this
policy
not
only
confines
the
market
for
these
product
within
our
own
border
,
to
the
direct
disadvantage
of
our
manufacturer
,
but
also
increase
their
cost
to
our
citizen
.
the
interest
of
labor
are
certainly
,
though
indirectly
,
involved
in
this
feature
of
our
tariff
system
.
the
sharp
competition
and
active
struggle
among
our
manufacturer
to
supply
the
limited
demand
for
their
good
soon
fill
the
narrow
market
to
which
they
are
confined
.
then
follows
a
suspension
of
work
in
mill
and
factory
,
a
discharge
of
employee
,
and
distress
in
the
home
of
our
workingman
.
even
if
the
often-disproved
assertion
could
be
made
good
that
a
lower
rate
of
wage
would
result
from
free
raw
material
and
low
tariff
duty
,
the
intelligence
of
our
workman
lead
them
quickly
to
discover
that
their
steady
employment
,
permitted
by
free
raw
material
,
is
the
most
important
factor
in
their
relation
to
tariff
legislation
.
a
measure
ha
been
prepared
by
the
appropriate
congressional
committee
embodying
tariff
reform
on
the
line
herein
suggested
,
which
will
be
promptly
submitted
for
legislative
action
.
it
is
the
result
of
much
patriotic
and
unselfish
work
,
and
i
believe
it
deal
with
it
subject
consistently
and
a
thoroughly
a
existing
condition
permit
.
i
am
satisfied
that
the
reduced
tariff
duty
provided
for
in
the
proposed
legislation
,
added
to
existing
internal-revenue
taxation
,
will
in
the
near
future
,
though
perhaps
not
immediately
,
produce
sufficient
revenue
to
meet
the
need
of
the
government
.
the
committee
,
after
full
consideration
and
to
provide
against
a
temporary
deficiency
which
may
exist
before
the
business
of
the
country
adjusts
itself
to
the
new
tariff
schedule
,
have
wisely
embraced
in
their
plan
a
few
additional
internal-revenue
tax
,
including
a
small
tax
upon
income
derived
from
certain
corporate
investment
.
these
new
adjustment
are
not
only
absolutely
just
and
easily
borne
,
but
they
have
the
further
merit
of
being
such
a
can
be
remitted
without
unfavorable
business
disturbance
whenever
the
necessity
of
their
imposition
no
longer
exists
.
in
my
great
desire
for
the
success
of
this
measure
i
can
not
restrain
the
suggestion
that
it
success
can
only
be
attained
by
mean
of
unselfish
counsel
on
the
part
of
the
friend
of
tariff
reform
and
a
a
result
of
their
willingness
to
subordinate
personal
desire
and
ambition
to
the
general
good
.
the
local
interest
affected
by
the
proposed
reform
are
so
numerous
and
so
varied
that
if
all
are
insisted
upon
the
legislation
embodying
the
reform
must
inevitably
fail
.
in
conclusion
my
intense
feeling
of
responsibility
impels
me
to
invoke
for
the
manifold
interest
of
a
generous
and
confiding
people
the
most
scrupulous
care
and
to
pledge
my
willing
support
to
every
legislative
effort
for
the
advancement
of
the
greatness
and
prosperity
of
our
beloved
country
.
