mr.
speaker
,
mr.
vice
president
,
member
of
congress
,
distinguished
guest
,
and
fellow
american
:
last
month
,
i
went
to
andrew
air
force
base
and
welcomed
home
some
of
our
last
troop
to
serve
in
iraq
.
together
,
we
offered
a
final
,
proud
salute
to
the
color
under
which
more
than
a
million
of
our
fellow
citizen
fought
and
several
thousand
gave
their
life
.
we
gather
tonight
knowing
that
this
generation
of
hero
ha
made
the
united
state
safer
and
more
respected
around
the
world
.
for
the
first
time
in
9
year
,
there
are
no
american
fighting
in
iraq
.
for
the
first
time
in
two
decade
,
usama
bin
laden
is
not
a
threat
to
this
country
.
most
of
al
qaida
's
top
lieutenant
have
been
defeated
.
the
taliban
's
momentum
ha
been
broken
,
and
some
troop
in
afghanistan
have
begun
to
come
home
.
these
achievement
are
a
testament
to
the
courage
,
selflessness
,
and
teamwork
of
america
's
armed
force
.
at
a
time
when
too
many
of
our
institution
have
let
u
down
,
they
exceed
all
expectation
.
they
're
not
consumed
with
personal
ambition
.
they
don't
ob
over
their
difference
.
they
focus
on
the
mission
at
hand
.
they
work
together
.
imagine
what
we
could
accomplish
if
we
followed
their
example
.
think
about
the
america
within
our
reach
:
a
country
that
lead
the
world
in
educating
it
people
;
an
america
that
attracts
a
new
generation
of
high-tech
manufacturing
and
high-paying
job
;
a
future
where
we
're
in
control
of
our
own
energy
and
our
security
and
prosperity
are
n't
so
tied
to
unstable
part
of
the
world
;
an
economy
built
to
last
,
where
hard
work
pay
off
and
responsibility
is
rewarded
.
we
can
do
this
.
i
know
we
can
,
because
we
've
done
it
before
.
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
,
when
another
generation
of
hero
returned
home
from
combat
,
they
built
the
strongest
economy
and
middle
class
the
world
ha
ever
known
.
my
grandfather
,
a
veteran
of
patton's
army
,
got
the
chance
to
go
to
college
on
the
gi
bill
.
my
grandmother
,
who
worked
on
a
bomber
assembly
line
,
wa
part
of
a
workforce
that
turned
out
the
best
product
on
earth
.
the
two
of
them
shared
the
optimism
of
a
nation
that
had
triumphed
over
a
depression
and
fascism
.
they
understood
they
were
part
of
something
larger
,
that
they
were
contributing
to
a
story
of
success
that
every
american
had
a
chance
to
share
,
the
basic
american
promise
that
if
you
worked
hard
,
you
could
do
well
enough
to
raise
a
family
,
own
a
home
,
send
your
kid
to
college
,
and
put
a
little
away
for
retirement
.
the
defining
issue
of
our
time
is
how
to
keep
that
promise
alive
.
no
challenge
is
more
urgent
.
no
debate
is
more
important
.
we
can
either
settle
for
a
country
where
a
shrinking
number
of
people
do
really
well
while
a
growing
number
of
american
barely
get
by
.
or
we
can
restore
an
economy
where
everyone
get
a
fair
shot
and
everyone
doe
their
fair
share
and
everyone
play
by
the
same
set
of
rule
.
what
's
at
stake
aren't
democratic
value
or
republican
value
,
but
american
value
.
and
we
have
to
reclaim
them
.
let
's
remember
how
we
got
here
.
long
before
the
recession
,
job
and
manufacturing
began
leaving
our
shore
.
technology
made
business
more
efficient
,
but
also
made
some
job
obsolete
.
folk
at
the
top
saw
their
income
rise
like
never
before
,
but
most
hard-working
american
struggled
with
cost
that
were
growing
,
paycheck
that
were
n't
,
and
personal
debt
that
kept
piling
up
.
in
2008
,
the
house
of
card
collapsed
.
we
learned
that
mortgage
had
been
sold
to
people
who
could
n't
afford
or
understand
them
.
bank
had
made
huge
bet
and
bonus
with
other
people
's
money
.
regulator
had
looked
the
other
way
or
did
n't
have
the
authority
to
stop
the
bad
behavior
.
it
wa
wrong
,
it
wa
irresponsible
,
and
it
plunged
our
economy
into
a
crisis
that
put
million
out
of
work
,
saddled
u
with
more
debt
,
and
left
innocent
,
hard-working
american
holding
the
bag
.
in
the
6
month
before
i
took
office
,
we
lost
nearly
4
million
job
.
and
we
lost
another
4
million
before
our
policy
were
in
full
effect
.
those
are
the
fact
.
but
so
are
these
:
in
the
last
22
month
,
business
have
created
more
than
3
million
job
.
last
year
,
they
created
the
most
job
since
2005
.
american
manufacturer
are
hiring
again
,
creating
job
for
the
first
time
since
the
late
1990s
.
together
,
we
've
agreed
to
cut
the
deficit
by
more
than
$
2
trillion
.
and
we
've
put
in
place
new
rule
to
hold
wall
street
accountable
so
a
crisis
like
this
never
happens
again
.
the
state
of
our
union
is
getting
stronger
.
and
we
've
come
too
far
to
turn
back
now
.
a
long
a
i
'm
president
,
i
will
work
with
anyone
in
this
chamber
to
build
on
this
momentum
.
but
i
intend
to
fight
obstruction
with
action
,
and
i
will
oppose
any
effort
to
return
to
the
very
same
policy
that
brought
on
this
economic
crisis
in
the
first
place
.
no
,
we
will
not
go
back
to
an
economy
weakened
by
outsourcing
,
bad
debt
,
and
phony
financial
profit
.
tonight
i
want
to
speak
about
how
we
move
forward
and
lay
out
a
blueprint
for
an
economy
that
's
built
to
last
,
an
economy
built
on
american
manufacturing
,
american
energy
,
skill
for
american
worker
,
and
a
renewal
of
american
value
.
now
,
this
blueprint
begin
with
american
manufacturing
.
on
the
day
i
took
office
,
our
auto
industry
wa
on
the
verge
of
collapse
.
some
even
said
we
should
let
it
die
.
with
a
million
job
at
stake
,
i
refused
to
let
that
happen
.
in
exchange
for
help
,
we
demanded
responsibility
.
we
got
worker
and
automaker
to
settle
their
difference
.
we
got
the
industry
to
retool
and
restructure
.
today
,
general
motor
is
back
on
top
a
the
world
's
number-one
automaker
.
chrysler
ha
grown
faster
in
the
u.s.
than
any
major
car
company
.
ford
is
investing
billion
in
u.s.
plant
and
factory
.
and
together
,
the
entire
industry
added
nearly
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
job
.
we
bet
on
american
worker
.
we
bet
on
american
ingenuity
.
and
tonight
,
the
american
auto
industry
is
back
.
what
's
happening
in
detroit
can
happen
in
other
industry
.
it
can
happen
in
cleveland
and
pittsburgh
and
raleigh
.
we
ca
n't
bring
every
job
back
that
's
left
our
shore
.
but
right
now
it
's
getting
more
expensive
to
do
business
in
place
like
china
.
meanwhile
,
america
is
more
productive
.
a
few
week
ago
,
the
ceo
of
master
lock
told
me
that
it
now
make
business
sense
for
him
to
bring
job
back
home
.
today
,
for
the
first
time
in
15
year
,
master
lock
's
unionized
plant
in
milwaukee
is
running
at
full
capacity
.
so
we
have
a
huge
opportunity
at
this
moment
to
bring
manufacturing
back
.
but
we
have
to
seize
it
.
tonight
my
message
to
business
leader
is
simple
:
ask
yourselves
what
you
can
do
to
bring
job
back
to
your
country
,
and
your
country
will
do
everything
we
can
to
help
you
succeed
.
we
should
start
with
our
tax
code
.
right
now
company
get
tax
break
for
moving
job
and
profit
overseas
.
meanwhile
,
company
that
choose
to
stay
in
america
get
hit
with
one
of
the
highest
tax
rate
in
the
world
.
it
make
no
sense
,
and
everyone
know
it
.
so
let
's
change
it
.
first
,
if
you
're
a
business
that
want
to
outsource
job
,
you
should
n't
get
a
tax
deduction
for
doing
it
.
that
money
should
be
used
to
cover
moving
expense
for
company
like
master
lock
that
decide
to
bring
job
home
.
second
,
no
american
company
should
be
able
to
avoid
paying
it
fair
share
of
tax
by
moving
job
and
profit
overseas
.
from
now
on
,
every
multinational
company
should
have
to
pay
a
basic
minimum
tax
.
and
every
penny
should
go
towards
lowering
tax
for
company
that
choose
to
stay
here
and
hire
here
in
america
.
third
,
if
you
're
an
american
manufacturer
,
you
should
get
a
bigger
tax
cut
.
if
you
're
a
high-tech
manufacturer
,
we
should
double
the
tax
deduction
you
get
for
making
your
product
here
.
and
if
you
want
to
relocate
in
a
community
that
wa
hit
hard
when
a
factory
left
town
,
you
should
get
help
financing
a
new
plant
,
equipment
,
or
training
for
new
worker
.
so
my
message
is
simple
:
it
is
time
to
stop
rewarding
business
that
ship
job
overseas
,
and
start
rewarding
company
that
create
job
right
here
in
america
.
send
me
these
tax
reform
,
and
i
will
sign
them
right
away
.
we
're
also
making
it
easier
for
american
business
to
sell
product
all
over
the
world
.
two
year
ago
,
i
set
a
goal
of
doubling
u.s.
export
over
5
year
.
with
the
bipartisan
trade
agreement
we
signed
into
law
,
we
're
on
track
to
meet
that
goal
ahead
of
schedule
.
and
soon
there
will
be
million
of
new
customer
for
american
good
in
panama
,
colombia
,
and
south
korea
.
soon
there
will
be
new
car
on
the
street
of
seoul
imported
from
detroit
and
toledo
and
chicago
.
i
will
go
anywhere
in
the
world
to
open
new
market
for
american
product
.
and
i
will
not
stand
by
when
our
competitor
do
n't
play
by
the
rule
.
we
've
brought
trade
case
against
china
at
nearly
twice
the
rate
a
the
last
administration
,
and
it
's
made
a
difference
.
over
a
thousand
american
are
working
today
because
we
stopped
a
surge
in
chinese
tire
.
but
we
need
to
do
more
.
it
's
not
right
when
another
country
let
our
movie
,
music
,
and
software
be
pirated
.
it
's
not
fair
when
foreign
manufacturer
have
a
leg
up
on
ours
only
because
they
're
heavily
subsidized
.
tonight
i
'm
announcing
the
creation
of
a
trade
enforcement
unit
that
will
be
charged
with
investigating
unfair
trading
practice
in
country
like
china
.
there
will
be
more
inspection
to
prevent
counterfeit
or
unsafe
good
from
crossing
our
border
.
and
this
congress
should
make
sure
that
no
foreign
company
ha
an
advantage
over
american
manufacturing
when
it
come
to
accessing
financing
or
new
market
like
russia
.
our
worker
are
the
most
productive
on
earth
,
and
if
the
playing
field
is
level
,
i
promise
you
,
america
will
always
win
.
i
also
hear
from
many
business
leader
who
want
to
hire
in
the
united
state
,
but
can't
find
worker
with
the
right
skill
.
growing
industry
in
science
and
technology
have
twice
a
many
opening
a
we
have
worker
who
can
do
the
job
.
think
about
that
:
opening
at
a
time
when
million
of
american
are
looking
for
work
.
it
's
inexcusable
,
and
we
know
how
to
fix
it
.
jackie
bray
is
a
single
mom
from
north
carolina
who
wa
laid
off
from
her
job
a
a
mechanic
.
then
siemens
opened
a
gas
turbine
factory
in
charlotte
and
formed
a
partnership
with
central
piedmont
community
college
.
the
company
helped
the
college
design
course
in
laser
and
robotics
training
.
it
paid
jackie
's
tuition
,
then
hired
her
to
help
operate
their
plant
.
i
want
every
american
looking
for
work
to
have
the
same
opportunity
a
jackie
did
.
join
me
in
a
national
commitment
to
train
2
million
american
with
skill
that
will
lead
directly
to
a
job
.
my
administration
ha
already
lined
up
more
company
that
want
to
help
.
model
partnership
between
business
like
siemens
and
community
college
in
place
like
charlotte
and
orlando
and
louisville
are
up
and
running
.
now
you
need
to
give
more
community
college
the
resource
they
need
to
become
community
career
center
,
place
that
teach
people
skill
that
business
are
looking
for
right
now
,
from
data
management
to
high-tech
manufacturing
.
and
i
want
to
cut
through
the
maze
of
confusing
training
program
so
that
from
now
on
,
people
like
jackie
have
one
program
,
one
web
site
,
and
one
place
to
go
for
all
the
information
and
help
that
they
need
.
it
is
time
to
turn
our
unemployment
system
into
a
reemployment
system
that
put
people
to
work
.
these
reform
will
help
people
get
job
that
are
open
today
.
but
to
prepare
for
the
job
of
tomorrow
,
our
commitment
to
skill
and
education
ha
to
start
earlier
.
for
le
than
1
percent
of
what
our
nation
spends
on
education
each
year
,
we
've
convinced
nearly
every
state
in
the
country
to
raise
their
standard
for
teaching
and
learning
,
the
first
time
that
's
happened
in
a
generation
.
but
challenge
remain
,
and
we
know
how
to
solve
them
.
at
a
time
when
other
country
are
doubling
down
on
education
,
tight
budget
have
forced
state
to
lay
off
thousand
of
teacher
.
we
know
a
good
teacher
can
increase
the
lifetime
income
of
a
classroom
by
over
$
250,000
.
a
great
teacher
can
offer
an
escape
from
poverty
to
the
child
who
dream
beyond
his
circumstance
.
every
person
in
this
chamber
can
point
to
a
teacher
who
changed
the
trajectory
of
their
life
.
most
teacher
work
tirelessly
,
with
modest
pay
,
sometimes
digging
into
their
own
pocket
for
school
supply
,
just
to
make
a
difference
.
teacher
matter
.
so
instead
of
bashing
them
or
defending
the
status
quo
,
let
's
offer
school
a
deal
.
give
them
the
resource
to
keep
good
teacher
on
the
job
and
reward
the
best
one
.
and
in
return
,
grant
school
flexibility
to
teach
with
creativity
and
passion
,
to
stop
teaching
to
the
test
,
and
to
replace
teacher
who
just
are
n't
helping
kid
learn
.
that
's
a
bargain
worth
making
.
we
also
know
that
when
student
do
n't
walk
away
from
their
education
,
more
of
them
walk
the
stage
to
get
their
diploma
.
when
student
are
not
allowed
to
drop
out
,
they
do
better
.
so
tonight
i
am
proposing
that
every
state—every
state—requires
that
all
student
stay
in
high
school
until
they
graduate
or
turn
18
.
when
kid
do
graduate
,
the
most
daunting
challenge
can
be
the
cost
of
college
.
at
a
time
when
american
owe
more
in
tuition
debt
than
credit
card
debt
,
this
congress
need
to
stop
the
interest
rate
on
student
loan
from
doubling
in
july
.
extend
the
tuition
tax
credit
we
started
that
save
million
of
middle
class
family
thousand
of
dollar
and
give
more
young
people
the
chance
to
earn
their
way
through
college
by
doubling
the
number
of
work-study
job
in
the
next
5
year
.
of
course
,
it
's
not
enough
for
u
to
increase
student
aid
.
we
ca
n't
just
keep
subsidizing
skyrocketing
tuition
;
we
'll
run
out
of
money
.
state
also
need
to
do
their
part
by
making
higher
education
a
higher
priority
in
their
budget
.
and
college
and
university
have
to
do
their
part
by
working
to
keep
cost
down
.
recently
,
i
spoke
with
a
group
of
college
president
who
have
done
just
that
.
some
school
redesign
course
to
help
student
finish
more
quickly
.
some
use
better
technology
.
the
point
is
,
it
's
possible
.
so
let
me
put
college
and
university
on
notice
:
if
you
ca
n't
stop
tuition
from
going
up
,
the
funding
you
get
from
taxpayer
will
go
down
.
higher
education
ca
n't
be
a
luxury
.
it
is
an
economic
imperative
that
every
family
in
america
should
be
able
to
afford
.
let
's
also
remember
that
hundred
of
thousand
of
talented
,
hard-working
student
in
this
country
face
another
challenge
:
the
fact
that
they
are
n't
yet
american
citizen
.
many
were
brought
here
a
small
child
,
are
american
through
and
through
,
yet
they
live
every
day
with
the
threat
of
deportation
.
others
came
more
recently
,
to
study
business
and
science
and
engineering
,
but
a
soon
a
they
get
their
degree
,
we
send
them
home
to
invent
new
product
and
create
new
job
somewhere
else
.
that
doe
n't
make
sense
.
i
believe
a
strongly
a
ever
that
we
should
take
on
illegal
immigration
.
that
's
why
my
administration
ha
put
more
boot
on
the
border
than
ever
before
.
that
's
why
there
are
fewer
illegal
crossing
than
when
i
took
office
.
the
opponent
of
action
are
out
of
excuse
.
we
should
be
working
on
comprehensive
immigration
reform
right
now
.
but
if
election-year
politics
keep
congress
from
acting
on
a
comprehensive
plan
,
let's
at
least
agree
to
stop
expelling
responsible
young
people
who
want
to
staff
our
lab
,
start
new
business
,
defend
this
country
.
send
me
a
law
that
give
them
the
chance
to
earn
their
citizenship
.
i
will
sign
it
right
away
.
you
see
,
an
economy
built
to
last
is
one
where
we
encourage
the
talent
and
ingenuity
of
every
person
in
this
country
.
that
mean
woman
should
earn
equal
pay
for
equal
work
.
it
mean
we
should
support
everyone
who
's
willing
to
work
and
every
risk
taker
and
entrepreneur
who
aspires
to
become
the
next
steve
job
.
after
all
,
innovation
is
what
america
ha
always
been
about
.
most
new
job
are
created
in
startup
and
small
business
.
so
let
's
pas
an
agenda
that
help
them
succeed
.
tear
down
regulation
that
prevent
aspiring
entrepreneur
from
getting
the
financing
to
grow
.
expand
tax
relief
to
small
business
that
are
raising
wage
and
creating
good
job
.
both
party
agree
on
these
idea
.
so
put
them
in
a
bill
and
get
it
on
my
desk
this
year
.
innovation
also
demand
basic
research
.
today
,
the
discovery
taking
place
in
our
federally
financed
lab
and
university
could
lead
to
new
treatment
that
kill
cancer
cell
,
but
leave
healthy
one
untouched
,
new
lightweight
vest
for
cop
and
soldier
that
can
stop
any
bullet
.
do
n't
gut
these
investment
in
our
budget
.
do
n't
let
other
country
win
the
race
for
the
future
.
support
the
same
kind
of
research
and
innovation
that
led
to
the
computer
chip
and
the
internet
,
to
new
american
job
and
new
american
industry
.
and
nowhere
is
the
promise
of
innovation
greater
than
in
american-made
energy
.
over
the
last
3
year
,
we
've
opened
million
of
new
acre
for
oil
and
gas
exploration
,
and
tonight
i
'm
directing
my
administration
to
open
more
than
75
percent
of
our
potential
offshore
oil
and
gas
resource
.
right
now—right
now—american
oil
production
is
the
highest
that
it
's
been
in
8
year
.
that
's
right
,
8
year
.
not
only
that
,
last
year
,
we
relied
le
on
foreign
oil
than
in
any
of
the
past
16
year
.
but
with
only
2
percent
of
the
world
's
oil
reserve
,
oil
is
n't
enough
.
this
country
need
an
all-out
,
all-of-the-above
strategy
that
develops
every
available
source
of
american
energy
,
a
strategy
that
's
cleaner
,
cheaper
,
and
full
of
new
job
.
we
have
a
supply
of
natural
gas
that
can
last
america
nearly
100
year
.
and
my
administration
will
take
every
possible
action
to
safely
develop
this
energy
.
expert
believe
this
will
support
more
than
600,000
job
by
the
end
of
the
decade
.
and
i'm
requiring
all
company
that
drill
for
gas
on
public
land
to
disclose
the
chemical
they
use
.
because
america
will
develop
this
resource
without
putting
the
health
and
safety
of
our
citizen
at
risk
.
the
development
of
natural
gas
will
create
job
and
power
truck
and
factory
that
are
cleaner
and
cheaper
,
proving
that
we
do
n't
have
to
choose
between
our
environment
and
our
economy
.
and
by
the
way
,
it
wa
public
research
dollar
,
over
the
course
of
30
year
,
that
helped
develop
the
technology
to
extract
all
this
natural
gas
out
of
shale
rock
,
reminding
u
that
government
support
is
critical
in
helping
business
get
new
energy
idea
off
the
ground
.
now
,
what
's
true
for
natural
gas
is
just
a
true
for
clean
energy
.
in
3
year
,
our
partnership
with
the
private
sector
ha
already
positioned
america
to
be
the
world's
leading
manufacturer
of
high-tech
battery
.
because
of
federal
investment
,
renewable
energy
use
ha
nearly
doubled
,
and
thousand
of
american
have
job
because
of
it
.
when
bryan
ritterby
wa
laid
off
from
his
job
making
furniture
,
he
said
he
worried
that
at
55
no
one
would
give
him
a
second
chance
.
but
he
found
work
at
energetx
,
a
wind
turbine
manufacturer
in
michigan
.
before
the
recession
,
the
factory
only
made
luxury
yacht
.
today
,
it
's
hiring
worker
like
bryan
,
who
said
,
``
i
'm
proud
to
be
working
in
the
industry
of
the
future
.
''
our
experience
with
shale
gas
,
our
experience
with
natural
gas
,
show
u
that
the
payoff
on
these
public
investment
do
n't
always
come
right
away
.
some
technology
do
n't
pan
out
,
some
company
fail
.
but
i
will
not
walk
away
from
the
promise
of
clean
energy
.
i
will
not
walk
away
from
worker
like
bryan
.
i
will
not
cede
the
wind
or
solar
or
battery
industry
to
china
or
germany
because
we
refuse
to
make
the
same
commitment
here
.
we
've
subsidized
oil
company
for
a
century
.
that
's
long
enough
.
it
's
time
to
end
the
taxpayer
giveaway
to
an
industry
that
rarely
ha
been
more
profitable
and
double
down
on
a
clean
energy
industry
that
never
ha
been
more
promising
.
pas
clean
energy
tax
credit
.
create
these
job
.
we
can
also
spur
energy
innovation
with
new
incentive
.
the
difference
in
this
chamber
may
be
too
deep
right
now
to
pas
a
comprehensive
plan
to
fight
climate
change
.
but
there
's
no
reason
why
congress
should
n't
at
least
set
a
clean
energy
standard
that
creates
a
market
for
innovation
.
so
far
,
you
have
n't
acted
.
well
,
tonight
i
will
.
i'm
directing
my
administration
to
allow
the
development
of
clean
energy
on
enough
public
land
to
power
3
million
home
.
and
i
'm
proud
to
announce
that
the
department
of
defense
,
working
with
u
,
the
world
's
largest
consumer
of
energy
,
will
make
one
of
the
largest
commitment
to
clean
energy
in
history
,
with
the
navy
purchasing
enough
capacity
to
power
a
quarter
of
a
million
home
a
year
.
of
course
,
the
easiest
way
to
save
money
is
to
waste
le
energy
.
so
here
's
a
proposal
:
help
manufacturer
eliminate
energy
waste
in
their
factory
and
give
business
incentive
to
upgrade
their
building
.
their
energy
bill
will
be
a
hundred
billion
dollar
lower
over
the
next
decade
,
and
america
will
have
le
pollution
,
more
manufacturing
,
more
job
for
construction
worker
who
need
them
.
send
me
a
bill
that
creates
these
job
.
building
this
new
energy
future
should
be
just
one
part
of
a
broader
agenda
to
repair
america
's
infrastructure
.
so
much
of
america
need
to
be
rebuilt
.
we
've
got
crumbling
road
and
bridge
,
a
power
grid
that
waste
too
much
energy
,
an
incomplete
high-speed
broadband
network
that
prevents
a
small-business
owner
in
rural
america
from
selling
her
product
all
over
the
world
.
during
the
great
depression
,
america
built
the
hoover
dam
and
the
golden
gate
bridge
.
after
world
war
ii
,
we
connected
our
state
with
a
system
of
highway
.
democratic
and
republican
administration
invested
in
great
project
that
benefited
everybody
,
from
the
worker
who
built
them
to
the
business
that
still
use
them
today
.
in
the
next
few
week
,
i
will
sign
an
executive
order
clearing
away
the
redtape
that
slows
down
too
many
construction
project
.
but
you
need
to
fund
these
project
.
take
the
money
we
're
no
longer
spending
at
war
,
use
half
of
it
to
pay
down
our
debt
,
and
use
the
rest
to
do
some
nation-building
right
here
at
home
.
there
's
never
been
a
better
time
to
build
,
especially
since
the
construction
industry
wa
one
of
the
hardest
hit
when
the
housing
bubble
burst
.
of
course
,
construction
worker
were
n't
the
only
one
who
were
hurt
.
so
were
million
of
innocent
american
who
've
seen
their
home
value
decline
.
and
while
government
ca
n't
fix
the
problem
on
it
own
,
responsible
homeowner
should
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
for
the
housing
market
to
hit
bottom
to
get
some
relief
.
and
that
's
why
i
'm
sending
this
congress
a
plan
that
give
every
responsible
homeowner
the
chance
to
save
about
$
3,000
a
year
on
their
mortgage
by
refinancing
at
historically
low
rate
.
no
more
redtape
.
no
more
runaround
from
the
bank
.
a
small
fee
on
the
largest
financial
institution
will
ensure
that
it
wo
n't
add
to
the
deficit
and
will
give
those
bank
that
were
rescued
by
taxpayer
a
chance
to
repay
a
deficit
of
trust
.
let
's
never
forget
:
million
of
american
who
work
hard
and
play
by
the
rule
every
day
deserve
a
government
and
a
financial
system
that
do
the
same
.
it
's
time
to
apply
the
same
rule
from
top
to
bottom
.
no
bailouts
,
no
handout
,
and
no
copout
.
an
america
built
to
last
insists
on
responsibility
from
everybody
.
we
've
all
paid
the
price
for
lender
who
sold
mortgage
to
people
who
could
n't
afford
them
and
buyer
who
knew
they
could
n't
afford
them
.
that
's
why
we
need
smart
regulation
to
prevent
irresponsible
behavior
.
rule
to
prevent
financial
fraud
or
toxic
dumping
or
faulty
medical
device
,
these
do
n't
destroy
the
free
market
.
they
make
the
free
market
work
better
.
there
's
no
question
that
some
regulation
are
outdated
,
unnecessary
,
or
too
costly
.
in
fact
,
i
've
approved
fewer
regulation
in
the
first
3
year
of
my
presidency
than
my
republican
predecessor
did
in
his
.
i
've
ordered
every
federal
agency
to
eliminate
rule
that
do
n't
make
sense
.
we
've
already
announced
over
500
reform
,
and
just
a
fraction
of
them
will
save
business
and
citizen
more
than
$
10
billion
over
the
next
5
year
.
we
got
rid
of
one
rule
from
40
year
ago
that
could
have
forced
some
dairy
farmer
to
spend
$
10,000
a
year
proving
that
they
could
contain
a
spill
,
because
milk
wa
somehow
classified
a
an
oil
.
with
a
rule
like
that
,
i
guess
it
wa
worth
cry
over
spilled
milk
.
[
laughter
]
now
,
i
'm
confident
a
farmer
can
contain
a
milk
spill
without
a
federal
agency
looking
over
his
shoulder
.
absolutely
.
but
i
will
not
back
down
from
making
sure
an
oil
company
can
contain
the
kind
of
oil
spill
we
saw
in
the
gulf
2
year
ago
.
i
will
not
back
down
from
protecting
our
kid
from
mercury
poisoning
or
making
sure
that
our
food
is
safe
and
our
water
is
clean
.
i
will
not
go
back
to
the
day
when
health
insurance
company
had
unchecked
power
to
cancel
your
policy
,
deny
your
coverage
,
or
charge
woman
differently
than
men
.
and
i
will
not
go
back
to
the
day
when
wall
street
wa
allowed
to
play
by
it
own
set
of
rule
.
the
new
rule
we
passed
restore
what
should
be
any
financial
system
's
core
purpose
:
getting
funding
to
entrepreneur
with
the
best
idea
and
getting
loan
to
responsible
family
who
want
to
buy
a
home
or
start
a
business
or
send
their
kid
to
college
.
so
if
you
are
a
big
bank
or
financial
institution
,
you
're
no
longer
allowed
to
make
risky
bet
with
your
customer
'
deposit
.
you
're
required
to
write
out
a
``
living
will
''
that
detail
exactly
how
you
'll
pay
the
bill
if
you
fail
,
because
the
rest
of
u
are
not
bailing
you
out
ever
again
.
and
if
you
're
a
mortgage
lender
or
a
payday
lender
or
a
credit
card
company
,
the
day
of
signing
people
up
for
product
they
ca
n't
afford
with
confusing
form
and
deceptive
practice
,
those
day
are
over
.
today
,
american
consumer
finally
have
a
watchdog
in
richard
cordray
,
with
one
job
:
to
look
out
for
them
.
we
'll
also
establish
a
financial
crime
unit
of
highly
trained
investigator
to
crack
down
on
large-scale
fraud
and
protect
people
's
investment
.
some
financial
firm
violate
major
antifraud
law
because
there
's
no
real
penalty
for
being
a
repeat
offender
.
that's
bad
for
consumer
,
and
it
's
bad
for
the
vast
majority
of
banker
and
financial
service
professional
who
do
the
right
thing
.
so
pas
legislation
that
make
the
penalty
for
fraud
count
.
and
tonight
i
'm
asking
my
attorney
general
to
create
a
special
unit
of
federal
prosecutor
and
leading
state
attorney
general
to
expand
our
investigation
into
the
abusive
lending
and
packaging
of
risky
mortgage
that
led
to
the
housing
crisis
.
this
new
unit
will
hold
accountable
those
who
broke
the
law
,
speed
assistance
to
homeowner
,
and
help
turn
the
page
on
an
era
of
recklessness
that
hurt
so
many
american
.
now
,
a
return
to
the
american
value
of
fair
play
and
shared
responsibility
will
help
protect
our
people
and
our
economy
.
but
it
should
also
guide
u
a
we
look
to
pay
down
our
debt
and
invest
in
our
future
.
right
now
our
most
immediate
priority
is
stopping
a
tax
hike
on
a
hundred
and
sixty
million
working
american
while
the
recovery
is
still
fragile
.
people
can
not
afford
losing
$
40
out
of
each
paycheck
this
year
.
there
are
plenty
of
way
to
get
this
done
.
so
let
's
agree
right
here
,
right
now
.
no
side
issue
.
no
drama
.
pas
the
payroll
tax
cut
without
delay
.
let
's
get
it
done
.
when
it
come
to
the
deficit
,
we
've
already
agreed
to
more
than
$
2
trillion
in
cut
and
saving
.
but
we
need
to
do
more
,
and
that
mean
making
choice
.
right
now
we
're
poised
to
spend
nearly
$
1
trillion
more
on
what
wa
supposed
to
be
a
temporary
tax
break
for
the
wealthiest
2
percent
of
american
.
right
now
because
of
loophole
and
shelter
in
the
tax
code
,
a
quarter
of
all
millionaire
pay
lower
tax
rate
than
million
of
middle
class
household
.
right
now
warren
buffett
pay
a
lower
tax
rate
than
his
secretary
.
do
we
want
to
keep
these
tax
cut
for
the
wealthiest
american
?
or
do
we
want
to
keep
our
investment
in
everything
else
,
like
education
and
medical
research
,
a
strong
military
and
care
for
our
veteran
?
because
if
we
're
serious
about
paying
down
our
debt
,
we
can't
do
both
.
the
american
people
know
what
the
right
choice
is
.
so
do
i
.
a
i
told
the
speaker
this
summer
,
i
'm
prepared
to
make
more
reform
that
rein
in
the
long-term
cost
of
medicare
and
medicaid
and
strengthen
social
security
,
so
long
a
those
program
remain
a
guarantee
of
security
for
senior
.
but
in
return
,
we
need
to
change
our
tax
code
so
that
people
like
me
,
and
an
awful
lot
of
member
of
congress
,
pay
our
fair
share
of
tax
.
tax
reform
should
follow
the
buffett
rule
.
if
you
make
more
than
a
million
dollar
a
year
,
you
should
not
pay
le
than
30
percent
in
tax
.
and
my
republican
friend
tom
coburn
is
right
:
washington
should
stop
subsidizing
millionaire
.
in
fact
,
if
you're
earning
a
million
dollar
a
year
,
you
should
n't
get
special
tax
subsidy
or
deduction
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
you
make
under
$
250,000
a
year
,
like
98
percent
of
american
family
,
your
tax
should
n't
go
up
.
you
're
the
one
struggling
with
rising
cost
and
stagnant
wage
.
you
're
the
one
who
need
relief
.
now
,
you
can
call
this
class
warfare
all
you
want
.
but
asking
a
billionaire
to
pay
at
least
a
much
a
his
secretary
in
tax
?
most
american
would
call
that
common
sense
.
we
do
n't
begrudge
financial
success
in
this
country
.
we
admire
it
.
when
american
talk
about
folk
like
me
paying
my
fair
share
of
tax
,
it
's
not
because
they
envy
the
rich
.
it
's
because
they
understand
that
when
i
get
a
tax
break
i
do
n't
need
and
the
country
ca
n't
afford
,
it
either
add
to
the
deficit
or
somebody
else
ha
to
make
up
the
difference
,
like
a
senior
on
a
fixed
income
or
a
student
trying
to
get
through
school
or
a
family
trying
to
make
end
meet
.
that
's
not
right
.
american
know
that
's
not
right
.
they
know
that
this
generation
's
success
is
only
possible
because
past
generation
felt
a
responsibility
to
each
other
and
to
the
future
of
their
country
,
and
they
know
our
way
of
life
will
only
endure
if
we
feel
that
same
sense
of
shared
responsibility
.
that
's
how
we
'll
reduce
our
deficit
.
that
's
an
america
built
to
last
.
now
,
i
recognize
that
people
watching
tonight
have
differing
view
about
tax
and
debt
,
energy
and
health
care
.
but
no
matter
what
party
they
belong
to
,
i
bet
most
american
are
thinking
the
same
thing
right
about
now
:
nothing
will
get
done
in
washington
this
year
or
next
year
or
maybe
even
the
year
after
that
,
because
washington
is
broken
.
can
you
blame
them
for
feeling
a
little
cynical
?
the
greatest
blow
to
our
confidence
in
our
economy
last
year
did
n't
come
from
event
beyond
our
control
.
it
came
from
a
debate
in
washington
over
whether
the
united
state
would
pay
it
bill
or
not
.
who
benefited
from
that
fiasco
?
i
've
talked
tonight
about
the
deficit
of
trust
between
main
street
and
wall
street
.
but
the
divide
between
this
city
and
the
rest
of
the
country
is
at
least
a
bad
,
and
it
seems
to
get
worse
every
year
.
now
,
some
of
this
ha
to
do
with
the
corrosive
influence
of
money
in
politics
.
so
together
,
let
's
take
some
step
to
fix
that
.
send
me
a
bill
that
ban
insider
trading
by
member
of
congress
.
i
will
sign
it
tomorrow
.
let
's
limit
any
elected
official
from
owning
stock
in
industry
they
impact
.
let
's
make
sure
people
who
bundle
campaign
contribution
for
congress
ca
n't
lobby
congress
and
vice
versa
,
an
idea
that
ha
bipartisan
support
,
at
least
outside
of
washington
.
some
of
what
's
broken
ha
to
do
with
the
way
congress
doe
it
business
these
day
.
a
simple
majority
is
no
longer
enough
to
get
anything—even
routine
business—passed
through
the
senate
.
neither
party
ha
been
blameless
in
these
tactic
.
now
both
party
should
put
an
end
to
it
.
for
starter
,
i
ask
the
senate
to
pas
a
simple
rule
that
all
judicial
and
public
service
nomination
receive
a
simple
up-or-down
vote
within
90
day
.
the
executive
branch
also
need
to
change
.
too
often
,
it
's
inefficient
,
outdated
,
and
remote
.
that
's
why
i
've
asked
this
congress
to
grant
me
the
authority
to
consolidate
the
federal
bureaucracy
so
that
our
government
is
leaner
,
quicker
,
and
more
responsive
to
the
need
of
the
american
people
.
finally
,
none
of
this
can
happen
unless
we
also
lower
the
temperature
in
this
town
.
we
need
to
end
the
notion
that
the
two
party
must
be
locked
in
a
perpetual
campaign
of
mutual
destruction
,
that
politics
is
about
clinging
to
rigid
ideology
instead
of
building
consensus
around
commonsense
idea
.
i
'm
a
democrat
,
but
i
believe
what
republican
abraham
lincoln
believed
:
that
government
should
do
for
people
only
what
they
can
not
do
better
by
themselves
and
no
more
.
that's
why
my
education
reform
offer
more
competition
and
more
control
for
school
and
state
.
that
's
why
we
're
getting
rid
of
regulation
that
do
n't
work
.
that
's
why
our
health
care
law
relies
on
a
reformed
private
market
,
not
a
government
program
.
on
the
other
hand
,
even
my
republican
friend
who
complain
the
most
about
government
spending
have
supported
federally
financed
road
and
clean
energy
project
and
federal
office
for
the
folk
back
home
.
the
point
is
,
we
should
all
want
a
smarter
,
more
effective
government
.
and
while
we
may
not
be
able
to
bridge
our
biggest
philosophical
difference
this
year
,
we
can
make
real
progress
.
with
or
without
this
congress
,
i
will
keep
taking
action
that
help
the
economy
grow
.
but
i
can
do
a
whole
lot
more
with
your
help
.
because
when
we
act
together
,
there
's
nothing
the
united
state
of
america
ca
n't
achieve
.
that
's
the
lesson
we
've
learned
from
our
action
abroad
over
the
last
few
year
.
ending
the
iraq
war
ha
allowed
u
to
strike
decisive
blow
against
our
enemy
.
from
pakistan
to
yemen
,
the
al
qaida
operative
who
remain
are
scrambling
,
knowing
that
they
can't
escape
the
reach
of
the
united
state
of
america
.
from
this
position
of
strength
,
we
've
begun
to
wind
down
the
war
in
afghanistan
.
ten
thousand
of
our
troop
have
come
home
.
twenty-three
thousand
more
will
leave
by
the
end
of
this
summer
.
this
transition
to
afghan
lead
will
continue
,
and
we
will
build
an
enduring
partnership
with
afghanistan
so
that
it
is
never
again
a
source
of
attack
against
america
.
a
the
tide
of
war
recedes
,
a
wave
of
change
ha
washed
across
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
,
from
tunis
to
cairo
,
from
sana'a
to
tripoli
.
a
year
ago
,
qadhafi
wa
one
of
the
world
's
longest
serving
dictator
,
a
murderer
with
american
blood
on
his
hand
.
today
,
he
is
gone
.
and
in
syria
,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
asad
regime
will
soon
discover
that
the
force
of
change
can
not
be
reversed
and
that
human
dignity
can
not
be
denied
.
how
this
incredible
transformation
will
end
remains
uncertain
.
but
we
have
a
huge
stake
in
the
outcome
.
and
while
it
's
ultimately
up
to
the
people
of
the
region
to
decide
their
fate
,
we
will
advocate
for
those
value
that
have
served
our
own
country
so
well
.
we
will
stand
against
violence
and
intimidation
.
we
will
stand
for
the
right
and
dignity
of
all
human
being
:
men
and
woman
;
christian
,
muslim
,
and
jew
.
we
will
support
policy
that
lead
to
strong
and
stable
democracy
and
open
market
,
because
tyranny
is
no
match
for
liberty
.
and
we
will
safeguard
america
's
own
security
against
those
who
threaten
our
citizen
,
our
friend
,
and
our
interest
.
look
at
iran
.
through
the
power
of
our
diplomacy
,
a
world
that
wa
once
divided
about
how
to
deal
with
iran
's
nuclear
program
now
stand
a
one
.
the
regime
is
more
isolated
than
ever
before
.
it
leader
are
faced
with
crippling
sanction
,
and
a
long
a
they
shirk
their
responsibility
,
this
pressure
will
not
relent
.
let
there
be
no
doubt
:
america
is
determined
to
prevent
iran
from
getting
a
nuclear
weapon
,
and
i
will
take
no
option
off
the
table
to
achieve
that
goal
.
but
a
peaceful
resolution
of
this
issue
is
still
possible
,
and
far
better
.
and
if
iran
change
course
and
meet
it
obligation
,
it
can
rejoin
the
community
of
nation
.
the
renewal
of
american
leadership
can
be
felt
across
the
globe
.
our
oldest
alliance
in
europe
and
asia
are
stronger
than
ever
.
our
tie
to
the
america
are
deeper
.
our
ironclad
commitment—and
i
mean
ironclad—to
israel
's
security
ha
meant
the
closest
military
cooperation
between
our
two
country
in
history
.
we
've
made
it
clear
that
america
is
a
pacific
power
,
and
a
new
beginning
in
burma
ha
lit
a
new
hope
.
from
the
coalition
we
've
built
to
secure
nuclear
material
,
to
the
mission
we
've
led
against
hunger
and
disease
,
from
the
blow
we
've
dealt
to
our
enemy
,
to
the
enduring
power
of
our
moral
example
,
america
is
back
.
anyone
who
tell
you
otherwise
,
anyone
who
tell
you
that
america
is
in
decline
or
that
our
influence
ha
waned
,
doe
n't
know
what
they
're
talking
about
.
that
's
not
the
message
we
get
from
leader
around
the
world
who
are
eager
to
work
with
u
.
that
's
not
how
people
feel
from
tokyo
to
berlin
,
from
cape
town
to
rio
,
where
opinion
of
america
are
higher
than
they
've
been
in
year
.
yes
,
the
world
is
changing
.
no
,
we
ca
n't
control
every
event
.
but
america
remains
the
one
indispensable
nation
in
world
affair
,
and
a
long
a
i
'm
president
,
i
intend
to
keep
it
that
way
.
that
's
why
,
working
with
our
military
leader
,
i
've
proposed
a
new
defense
strategy
that
ensures
we
maintain
the
finest
military
in
the
world
,
while
saving
nearly
half
a
trillion
dollar
in
our
budget
.
to
stay
one
step
ahead
of
our
adversary
,
i
've
already
sent
this
congress
legislation
that
will
secure
our
country
from
the
growing
danger
of
cyber
threat
.
above
all
,
our
freedom
endures
because
of
the
men
and
woman
in
uniform
who
defend
it
.
a
they
come
home
,
we
must
serve
them
a
well
a
they
've
served
u
.
that
includes
giving
them
the
care
and
the
benefit
they
have
earned
,
which
is
why
we
've
increased
annual
va
spending
every
year
i
've
been
president
.
and
it
mean
enlisting
our
veteran
in
the
work
of
rebuilding
our
nation
.
with
the
bipartisan
support
of
this
congress
,
we
're
providing
new
tax
credit
to
company
that
hire
vet
.
michelle
and
jill
biden
have
worked
with
american
business
to
secure
a
pledge
of
135,000
job
for
veteran
and
their
family
.
and
tonight
i'm
proposing
a
veteran
job
corp
that
will
help
our
community
hire
veteran
a
cop
and
firefighter
,
so
that
america
is
a
strong
a
those
who
defend
her
.
which
brings
me
back
to
where
i
began
.
those
of
u
who
've
been
sent
here
to
serve
can
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
the
service
of
our
troop
.
when
you
put
on
that
uniform
,
it
doe
n't
matter
if
you
're
black
or
white
,
asian
,
latino
,
native
american
;
conservative
,
liberal
;
rich
,
poor
;
gay
,
straight
.
when
you
're
marching
into
battle
,
you
look
out
for
the
person
next
to
you
or
the
mission
fails
.
when
you
're
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
,
you
rise
or
fall
a
one
unit
,
serving
one
nation
,
leaving
no
one
behind
.
you
know
,
one
of
my
proudest
possession
is
the
flag
that
the
seal
team
took
with
them
on
the
mission
to
get
bin
laden
.
on
it
are
each
of
their
name
.
some
may
be
democrat
,
some
may
be
republican
,
but
that
doe
n't
matter
.
just
like
it
did
n't
matter
that
day
in
the
situation
room
,
when
i
sat
next
to
bob
gate
,
a
man
who
wa
george
bush
's
defense
secretary
,
and
hillary
clinton
,
a
woman
who
ran
against
me
for
president
.
all
that
mattered
that
day
wa
the
mission
.
no
one
thought
about
politics
.
no
one
thought
about
themselves
.
one
of
the
young
men
involved
in
the
raid
later
told
me
that
he
didn't
deserve
credit
for
the
mission
.
it
only
succeeded
,
he
said
,
because
every
single
member
of
that
unit
did
their
job
:
the
pilot
who
landed
the
helicopter
that
spun
out
of
control
,
the
translator
who
kept
others
from
entering
the
compound
,
the
troop
who
separated
the
woman
and
child
from
the
fight
,
the
seal
who
charged
up
the
stair
.
more
than
that
,
the
mission
only
succeeded
because
every
member
of
that
unit
trusted
each
other
,
because
you
ca
n't
charge
up
those
stair
into
darkness
and
danger
unless
you
know
that
there
's
somebody
behind
you
,
watching
your
back
.
so
it
is
with
america
.
each
time
i
look
at
that
flag
,
i
'm
reminded
that
our
destiny
is
stitched
together
like
those
50
star
and
those
13
stripe
.
no
one
built
this
country
on
their
own
.
this
nation
is
great
because
we
built
it
together
.
this
nation
is
great
because
we
worked
a
a
team
.
this
nation
is
great
because
we
get
each
other
's
back
.
and
if
we
hold
fast
to
that
truth
,
in
this
moment
of
trial
,
there
is
no
challenge
too
great
,
no
mission
too
hard
.
a
long
a
we
are
joined
in
common
purpose
,
a
long
a
we
maintain
our
common
resolve
,
our
journey
move
forward
,
and
our
future
is
hopeful
,
and
the
state
of
our
union
will
always
be
strong
.
thank
you
,
