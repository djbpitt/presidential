my
fellow
american
--
and
my
fellow
citizen
of
the
world
community
:
i
ask
you
to
share
with
me
today
the
majesty
of
this
moment
.
in
the
orderly
transfer
of
power
,
we
celebrate
the
unity
that
keep
u
free
.
each
moment
in
history
is
a
fleeting
time
,
precious
and
unique
.
but
some
stand
out
a
moment
of
beginning
,
in
which
course
are
set
that
shape
decade
or
century
.
this
can
be
such
a
moment
.
force
now
are
converging
that
make
possible
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
hope
that
many
of
man
's
deepest
aspiration
can
at
last
be
realized
.
the
spiraling
pace
of
change
allows
u
to
contemplate
,
within
our
own
lifetime
,
advance
that
once
would
have
taken
century
.
in
throwing
wide
the
horizon
of
space
,
we
have
discovered
new
horizon
on
earth
.
for
the
first
time
,
because
the
people
of
the
world
want
peace
,
and
the
leader
of
the
world
are
afraid
of
war
,
the
time
are
on
the
side
of
peace
.
eight
year
from
now
america
will
celebrate
it
200th
anniversary
a
a
nation
.
within
the
lifetime
of
most
people
now
living
,
mankind
will
celebrate
that
great
new
year
which
come
only
once
in
a
thousand
year
--
the
beginning
of
the
third
millennium
.
what
kind
of
nation
we
will
be
,
what
kind
of
world
we
will
live
in
,
whether
we
shape
the
future
in
the
image
of
our
hope
,
is
ours
to
determine
by
our
action
and
our
choice
.
the
greatest
honor
history
can
bestow
is
the
title
of
peacemaker
.
this
honor
now
beckons
america
--
the
chance
to
help
lead
the
world
at
last
out
of
the
valley
of
turmoil
,
and
onto
that
high
ground
of
peace
that
man
ha
dreamed
of
since
the
dawn
of
civilization
.
if
we
succeed
,
generation
to
come
will
say
of
u
now
living
that
we
mastered
our
moment
,
that
we
helped
make
the
world
safe
for
mankind
.
this
is
our
summons
to
greatness
.
i
believe
the
american
people
are
ready
to
answer
this
call
.
the
second
third
of
this
century
ha
been
a
time
of
proud
achievement
.
we
have
made
enormous
stride
in
science
and
industry
and
agriculture
.
we
have
shared
our
wealth
more
broadly
than
ever
.
we
have
learned
at
last
to
manage
a
modern
economy
to
assure
it
continued
growth
.
we
have
given
freedom
new
reach
,
and
we
have
begun
to
make
it
promise
real
for
black
a
well
a
for
white
.
we
see
the
hope
of
tomorrow
in
the
youth
of
today
.
i
know
america
's
youth
.
i
believe
in
them
.
we
can
be
proud
that
they
are
better
educated
,
more
committed
,
more
passionately
driven
by
conscience
than
any
generation
in
our
history
.
no
people
ha
ever
been
so
close
to
the
achievement
of
a
just
and
abundant
society
,
or
so
possessed
of
the
will
to
achieve
it
.
because
our
strength
are
so
great
,
we
can
afford
to
appraise
our
weakness
with
candor
and
to
approach
them
with
hope
.
standing
in
this
same
place
a
third
of
a
century
ago
,
franklin
delano
roosevelt
addressed
a
nation
ravaged
by
depression
and
gripped
in
fear
.
he
could
say
in
surveying
the
nation
's
trouble
:
``
they
concern
,
thank
god
,
only
material
thing
.
''
our
crisis
today
is
the
reverse
.
we
have
found
ourselves
rich
in
good
,
but
ragged
in
spirit
;
reaching
with
magnificent
precision
for
the
moon
,
but
falling
into
raucous
discord
on
earth
.
we
are
caught
in
war
,
wanting
peace
.
we
are
torn
by
division
,
wanting
unity
.
we
see
around
u
empty
life
,
wanting
fulfillment
.
we
see
task
that
need
doing
,
waiting
for
hand
to
do
them
.
to
a
crisis
of
the
spirit
,
we
need
an
answer
of
the
spirit
.
to
find
that
answer
,
we
need
only
look
within
ourselves
.
when
we
listen
to
``
the
better
angel
of
our
nature
,
''
we
find
that
they
celebrate
the
simple
thing
,
the
basic
thing
--
such
a
goodness
,
decency
,
love
,
kindness
.
greatness
come
in
simple
trapping
.
the
simple
thing
are
the
one
most
needed
today
if
we
are
to
surmount
what
divide
u
,
and
cement
what
unites
u
.
to
lower
our
voice
would
be
a
simple
thing
.
in
these
difficult
year
,
america
ha
suffered
from
a
fever
of
word
;
from
inflated
rhetoric
that
promise
more
than
it
can
deliver
;
from
angry
rhetoric
that
fan
discontent
into
hatred
;
from
bombastic
rhetoric
that
posture
instead
of
persuading
.
we
can
not
learn
from
one
another
until
we
stop
shouting
at
one
another
--
until
we
speak
quietly
enough
so
that
our
word
can
be
heard
a
well
a
our
voice
.
for
it
part
,
government
will
listen
.
we
will
strive
to
listen
in
new
way
--
to
the
voice
of
quiet
anguish
,
the
voice
that
speak
without
word
,
the
voice
of
the
heart
--
to
the
injured
voice
,
the
anxious
voice
,
the
voice
that
have
despaired
of
being
heard
.
those
who
have
been
left
out
,
we
will
try
to
bring
in
.
those
left
behind
,
we
will
help
to
catch
up
.
for
all
of
our
people
,
we
will
set
a
our
goal
the
decent
order
that
make
progress
possible
and
our
life
secure
.
a
we
reach
toward
our
hope
,
our
task
is
to
build
on
what
ha
gone
before
--
not
turning
away
from
the
old
,
but
turning
toward
the
new
.
in
this
past
third
of
a
century
,
government
ha
passed
more
law
,
spent
more
money
,
initiated
more
program
,
than
in
all
our
previous
history
.
in
pursuing
our
goal
of
full
employment
,
better
housing
,
excellence
in
education
;
in
rebuilding
our
city
and
improving
our
rural
area
;
in
protecting
our
environment
and
enhancing
the
quality
of
life
--
in
all
these
and
more
,
we
will
and
must
press
urgently
forward
.
we
shall
plan
now
for
the
day
when
our
wealth
can
be
transferred
from
the
destruction
of
war
abroad
to
the
urgent
need
of
our
people
at
home
.
the
american
dream
doe
not
come
to
those
who
fall
asleep
.
but
we
are
approaching
the
limit
of
what
government
alone
can
do
.
our
greatest
need
now
is
to
reach
beyond
government
,
and
to
enlist
the
legion
of
the
concerned
and
the
committed
.
what
ha
to
be
done
,
ha
to
be
done
by
government
and
people
together
or
it
will
not
be
done
at
all
.
the
lesson
of
past
agony
is
that
without
the
people
we
can
do
nothing
;
with
the
people
we
can
do
everything
.
to
match
the
magnitude
of
our
task
,
we
need
the
energy
of
our
people
--
enlisted
not
only
in
grand
enterprise
,
but
more
importantly
in
those
small
,
splendid
effort
that
make
headline
in
the
neighborhood
newspaper
instead
of
the
national
journal
.
with
these
,
we
can
build
a
great
cathedral
of
the
spirit
--
each
of
u
raising
it
one
stone
at
a
time
,
a
he
reach
out
to
his
neighbor
,
helping
,
caring
,
doing
.
i
do
not
offer
a
life
of
uninspiring
ease
.
i
do
not
call
for
a
life
of
grim
sacrifice
.
i
ask
you
to
join
in
a
high
adventure
--
one
a
rich
a
humanity
itself
,
and
a
exciting
a
the
time
we
live
in
.
the
essence
of
freedom
is
that
each
of
u
share
in
the
shaping
of
his
own
destiny
.
until
he
ha
been
part
of
a
cause
larger
than
himself
,
no
man
is
truly
whole
.
the
way
to
fulfillment
is
in
the
use
of
our
talent
;
we
achieve
nobility
in
the
spirit
that
inspires
that
use
.
a
we
measure
what
can
be
done
,
we
shall
promise
only
what
we
know
we
can
produce
,
but
a
we
chart
our
goal
we
shall
be
lifted
by
our
dream
.
no
man
can
be
fully
free
while
his
neighbor
is
not
.
to
go
forward
at
all
is
to
go
forward
together
.
this
mean
black
and
white
together
,
a
one
nation
,
not
two
.
the
law
have
caught
up
with
our
conscience
.
what
remains
is
to
give
life
to
what
is
in
the
law
:
to
ensure
at
last
that
a
all
are
born
equal
in
dignity
before
god
,
all
are
born
equal
in
dignity
before
man
.
a
we
learn
to
go
forward
together
at
home
,
let
u
also
seek
to
go
forward
together
with
all
mankind
.
let
u
take
a
our
goal
:
where
peace
is
unknown
,
make
it
welcome
;
where
peace
is
fragile
,
make
it
strong
;
where
peace
is
temporary
,
make
it
permanent
.
after
a
period
of
confrontation
,
we
are
entering
an
era
of
negotiation
.
let
all
nation
know
that
during
this
administration
our
line
of
communication
will
be
open
.
we
seek
an
open
world
--
open
to
idea
,
open
to
the
exchange
of
good
and
people
--
a
world
in
which
no
people
,
great
or
small
,
will
live
in
angry
isolation
.
we
can
not
expect
to
make
everyone
our
friend
,
but
we
can
try
to
make
no
one
our
enemy
.
those
who
would
be
our
adversary
,
we
invite
to
a
peaceful
competition
--
not
in
conquering
territory
or
extending
dominion
,
but
in
enriching
the
life
of
man
.
a
we
explore
the
reach
of
space
,
let
u
go
to
the
new
world
together
--
not
a
new
world
to
be
conquered
,
but
a
a
new
adventure
to
be
shared
.
with
those
who
are
willing
to
join
,
let
u
cooperate
to
reduce
the
burden
of
arm
,
to
strengthen
the
structure
of
peace
,
to
lift
up
the
poor
and
the
hungry
.
but
to
all
those
who
would
be
tempted
by
weakness
,
let
u
leave
no
doubt
that
we
will
be
a
strong
a
we
need
to
be
for
a
long
a
we
need
to
be
.
over
the
past
twenty
year
,
since
i
first
came
to
this
capital
a
a
freshman
congressman
,
i
have
visited
most
of
the
nation
of
the
world
.
i
have
come
to
know
the
leader
of
the
world
,
and
the
great
force
,
the
hatred
,
the
fear
that
divide
the
world
.
i
know
that
peace
doe
not
come
through
wishing
for
it
--
that
there
is
no
substitute
for
day
and
even
year
of
patient
and
prolonged
diplomacy
.
i
also
know
the
people
of
the
world
.
i
have
seen
the
hunger
of
a
homeless
child
,
the
pain
of
a
man
wounded
in
battle
,
the
grief
of
a
mother
who
ha
lost
her
son
.
i
know
these
have
no
ideology
,
no
race
.
i
know
america
.
i
know
the
heart
of
america
is
good
.
i
speak
from
my
own
heart
,
and
the
heart
of
my
country
,
the
deep
concern
we
have
for
those
who
suffer
,
and
those
who
sorrow
.
i
have
taken
an
oath
today
in
the
presence
of
god
and
my
countryman
to
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
.
to
that
oath
i
now
add
this
sacred
commitment
:
i
shall
consecrate
my
office
,
my
energy
,
and
all
the
wisdom
i
can
summon
,
to
the
cause
of
peace
among
nation
.
let
this
message
be
heard
by
strong
and
weak
alike
:
the
peace
we
seek
to
win
is
not
victory
over
any
other
people
,
but
the
peace
that
come
``
with
healing
in
it
wing
''
;
with
compassion
for
those
who
have
suffered
;
with
understanding
for
those
who
have
opposed
u
;
with
the
opportunity
for
all
the
people
of
this
earth
to
choose
their
own
destiny
.
only
a
few
short
week
ago
,
we
shared
the
glory
of
man
's
first
sight
of
the
world
a
god
see
it
,
a
a
single
sphere
reflecting
light
in
the
darkness
.
a
the
apollo
astronaut
flew
over
the
moon
's
gray
surface
on
christmas
eve
,
they
spoke
to
u
of
the
beauty
of
earth
--
and
in
that
voice
so
clear
across
the
lunar
distance
,
we
heard
them
invoke
god
's
blessing
on
it
goodness
.
in
that
moment
,
their
view
from
the
moon
moved
poet
archibald
macleish
to
write
:
``
to
see
the
earth
a
it
truly
is
,
small
and
blue
and
beautiful
in
that
eternal
silence
where
it
float
,
is
to
see
ourselves
a
rider
on
the
earth
together
,
brother
on
that
bright
loveliness
in
the
eternal
cold
--
brother
who
know
now
they
are
truly
brother
.
''
in
that
moment
of
surpassing
technological
triumph
,
men
turned
their
thought
toward
home
and
humanity
--
seeing
in
that
far
perspective
that
man
's
destiny
on
earth
is
not
divisible
;
telling
u
that
however
far
we
reach
into
the
cosmos
,
our
destiny
lie
not
in
the
star
but
on
earth
itself
,
in
our
own
hand
,
in
our
own
heart
.
we
have
endured
a
long
night
of
the
american
spirit
.
but
a
our
eye
catch
the
dimness
of
the
first
ray
of
dawn
,
let
u
not
curse
the
remaining
dark
.
let
u
gather
the
light
.
our
destiny
offer
,
not
the
cup
of
despair
,
but
the
chalice
of
opportunity
.
so
let
u
seize
it
,
not
in
fear
,
but
in
gladness
--
and
,
``
rider
on
the
earth
together
,
''
let
u
go
forward
,
firm
in
our
faith
,
steadfast
in
our
purpose
,
cautious
of
the
danger
;
but
sustained
by
our
confidence
in
the
will
of
god
and
the
promise
of
man
.
