fellow
citizen
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representative
:
among
the
vicissitude
incident
to
life
,
no
event
could
have
filled
me
with
greater
anxiety
than
that
of
which
the
notification
wa
transmitted
by
your
order
,
and
received
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
present
month
.
on
the
one
hand
,
i
wa
summoned
by
my
country
,
whose
voice
i
can
never
hear
but
with
veneration
and
love
,
from
a
retreat
which
i
had
chosen
with
the
fondest
predilection
,
and
,
in
my
flattering
hope
,
with
an
immutable
decision
,
a
the
asylum
of
my
declining
year
:
a
retreat
which
wa
rendered
every
day
more
necessary
a
well
a
more
dear
to
me
,
by
the
addition
of
habit
to
inclination
,
and
of
frequent
interruption
in
my
health
to
the
gradual
waste
committed
on
it
by
time
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
magnitude
and
difficulty
of
the
trust
to
which
the
voice
of
my
country
called
me
,
being
sufficient
to
awaken
in
the
wisest
and
most
experienced
of
her
citizen
,
a
distrustful
scrutiny
into
his
qualification
,
could
not
but
overwhelm
with
dispondence
,
one
,
who
,
inheriting
inferior
endowment
from
nature
and
unpractised
in
the
duty
of
civil
administration
,
ought
to
be
peculiarly
conscious
of
his
own
deficencies
.
in
this
conflict
of
emotion
,
all
i
dare
aver
,
is
,
that
it
ha
been
my
faithful
study
to
collect
my
duty
from
a
just
appreciation
of
every
circumstance
,
by
which
it
might
be
affected
.
all
i
dare
hope
,
is
,
that
,
if
in
executing
this
task
i
have
been
too
much
swayed
by
a
grateful
remembrance
of
former
instance
,
or
by
an
affectionate
sensibility
to
this
transcendent
proof
,
of
the
confidence
of
my
fellow-citizens
;
and
have
thence
too
little
consulted
my
incapacity
a
well
a
disinclination
for
the
weighty
and
untried
care
before
me
;
my
error
will
be
palliated
by
the
motif
which
misled
me
,
and
it
consequence
be
judged
by
my
country
,
with
some
share
of
the
partiality
in
which
they
originated
.
such
being
the
impression
under
which
i
have
,
in
obedience
to
the
public
summons
,
repaired
to
the
present
station
;
it
would
be
peculiarly
improper
to
omit
in
this
first
official
act
,
my
fervent
supplication
to
that
almighty
being
who
rule
over
the
universe
,
who
presides
in
the
council
of
nation
,
and
whose
providential
aid
can
supply
every
human
defect
,
that
his
benediction
may
consecrate
to
the
liberty
and
happiness
of
the
people
of
the
united
state
,
a
government
instituted
by
themselves
for
these
essential
purpose
:
and
may
enable
every
instrument
employed
in
it
administration
to
execute
with
success
,
the
function
allotted
to
his
charge
.
in
tendering
this
homage
to
the
great
author
of
every
public
and
private
good
,
i
assure
myself
that
it
express
your
sentiment
not
le
than
my
own
;
nor
those
of
my
fellow-citizens
at
large
,
le
than
either
.
no
people
can
be
bound
to
acknowledge
and
adore
the
invisible
hand
,
which
conduct
the
affair
of
men
more
than
the
people
of
the
united
state
.
every
step
,
by
which
they
have
advanced
to
the
character
of
an
independent
nation
,
seems
to
have
been
distinguished
by
some
token
of
providential
agency
.
and
in
the
important
revolution
just
accomplished
in
the
system
of
their
united
government
,
the
tranquil
deliberation
and
voluntary
consent
of
so
many
distinct
community
,
from
which
the
event
ha
resulted
,
can
not
be
compared
with
the
mean
by
which
most
government
have
been
established
,
without
some
return
of
pious
gratitude
along
with
an
humble
anticipation
of
the
future
blessing
which
the
past
seem
to
presage
.
these
reflection
,
arising
out
of
the
present
crisis
,
have
forced
themselves
too
strongly
on
my
mind
to
be
suppressed
.
you
will
join
with
me
i
trust
in
thinking
,
that
there
are
none
under
the
influence
of
which
,
the
proceeding
of
a
new
and
free
government
can
more
auspiciously
commence
.
by
the
article
establishing
the
executive
department
,
it
is
made
the
duty
of
the
president
``
to
recommend
to
your
consideration
,
such
measure
a
he
shall
judge
necessary
and
expedient
.
''
the
circumstance
under
which
i
now
meet
you
,
will
acquit
me
from
entering
into
that
subject
,
farther
than
to
refer
to
the
great
constitutional
charter
under
which
you
are
assembled
;
and
which
,
in
defining
your
power
,
designates
the
object
to
which
your
attention
is
to
be
given
.
it
will
be
more
consistent
with
those
circumstance
,
and
far
more
congenial
with
the
feeling
which
actuate
me
,
to
substitute
,
in
place
of
a
recommendation
of
particular
measure
,
the
tribute
that
is
due
to
the
talent
,
the
rectitude
,
and
the
patriotism
which
adorn
the
character
selected
to
devise
and
adopt
them
.
in
these
honorable
qualification
,
i
behold
the
surest
pledge
,
that
a
on
one
side
,
no
local
prejudice
,
or
attachment
;
no
seperate
view
,
nor
party
animosity
,
will
misdirect
the
comprehensive
and
equal
eye
which
ought
to
watch
over
this
great
assemblage
of
community
and
interest
:
so
,
on
another
,
that
the
foundation
of
our
national
policy
will
be
laid
in
the
pure
and
immutable
principle
of
private
morality
;
and
the
pre-eminence
of
a
free
government
,
be
exemplified
by
all
the
attribute
which
can
win
the
affection
of
it
citizen
,
and
command
the
respect
of
the
world
.
i
dwell
on
this
prospect
with
every
satisfaction
which
an
ardent
love
for
my
country
can
inspire
:
since
there
is
no
truth
more
thoroughly
established
,
than
that
there
exists
in
the
oeconomy
and
course
of
nature
,
an
indissoluble
union
between
virtue
and
happiness
,
between
duty
and
advantage
,
between
the
genuine
maxim
of
an
honest
and
magnanimous
policy
,
and
the
solid
reward
of
public
prosperity
and
felicity
:
since
we
ought
to
be
no
le
persuaded
that
the
propitious
smile
of
heaven
,
can
never
be
expected
on
a
nation
that
disregard
the
eternal
rule
of
order
and
right
,
which
heaven
itself
ha
ordained
:
and
since
the
preservation
of
the
sacred
fire
of
liberty
,
and
the
destiny
of
the
republican
model
of
government
,
are
justly
considered
a
deeply
,
perhaps
a
finally
staked
,
on
the
experiment
entrusted
to
the
hand
of
the
american
people
.
besides
the
ordinary
object
submitted
to
your
care
,
it
will
remain
with
your
judgment
to
decide
,
how
far
an
exercise
of
the
occasional
power
delegated
by
the
fifth
article
of
the
constitution
is
rendered
expedient
at
the
present
juncture
by
the
nature
of
objection
which
have
been
urged
against
the
system
,
or
by
the
degree
of
inquietude
which
ha
given
birth
to
them
.
instead
of
undertaking
particular
recommendation
on
this
subject
,
in
which
i
could
be
guided
by
no
light
derived
from
official
opportunity
,
i
shall
again
give
way
to
my
entire
confidence
in
your
discernment
and
pursuit
of
the
public
good
:
for
i
assure
myself
that
whilst
you
carefully
avoid
every
alteration
which
might
endanger
the
benefit
of
an
united
and
effective
government
,
or
which
ought
to
await
the
future
lesson
of
experience
;
a
reverence
for
the
characteristic
right
of
freeman
,
and
a
regard
for
the
public
harmony
,
will
sufficiently
influence
your
deliberation
on
the
question
how
far
the
former
can
be
more
impregnably
fortified
,
or
the
latter
be
safely
and
advantageously
promoted
.
to
the
preceeding
observation
i
have
one
to
add
,
which
will
be
most
properly
addressed
to
the
house
of
representative
.
it
concern
myself
,
and
will
therefore
be
a
brief
a
possible
.
when
i
wa
first
honoured
with
a
call
into
the
service
of
my
country
,
then
on
the
eve
of
an
arduous
struggle
for
it
liberty
,
the
light
in
which
i
contemplated
my
duty
required
that
i
should
renounce
every
pecuniary
compensation
.
from
this
resolution
i
have
in
no
instance
departed
.
and
being
still
under
the
impression
which
produced
it
,
i
must
decline
a
inapplicable
to
myself
,
any
share
in
the
personal
emolument
,
which
may
be
indispensably
included
in
a
permanent
provision
for
the
executive
department
;
and
must
accordingly
pray
that
the
pecuniary
estimate
for
the
station
in
which
i
am
placed
,
may
,
during
my
continuance
in
it
,
be
limited
to
such
actual
expenditure
a
the
public
good
may
be
thought
to
require
.
having
thus
imparted
to
you
my
sentiment
,
a
they
have
been
awakened
by
the
occasion
which
brings
u
together
,
i
shall
take
my
present
leave
;
but
not
without
resorting
once
more
to
the
benign
parent
of
the
human
race
,
in
humble
supplication
that
since
he
ha
been
pleased
to
favour
the
american
people
,
with
opportunity
for
deliberating
in
perfect
tranquility
,
and
disposition
for
deciding
with
unparellelled
unanimity
on
a
form
of
government
,
for
the
security
of
their
union
,
and
the
advancement
of
their
happiness
;
so
his
divine
blessing
may
be
equally
conspicuous
in
the
enlarged
view
,
the
temperate
consultation
,
and
the
wise
measure
on
which
the
success
of
this
government
must
depend
.
