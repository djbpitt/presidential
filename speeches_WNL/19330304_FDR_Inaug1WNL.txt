president
hoover
,
mr.
chief
justice
,
my
friend
:
this
is
a
day
of
national
consecration
.
and
i
am
certain
that
on
this
day
my
fellow
american
expect
that
on
my
induction
into
the
presidency
i
will
address
them
with
a
candor
and
a
decision
which
the
present
situation
of
our
people
impels
.
this
is
preeminently
the
time
to
speak
the
truth
,
the
whole
truth
,
frankly
and
boldly
.
nor
need
we
shrink
from
honestly
facing
condition
in
our
country
today
.
this
great
nation
will
endure
a
it
ha
endured
,
will
revive
and
will
prosper
.
so
,
first
of
all
,
let
me
assert
my
firm
belief
that
the
only
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
itself—nameless
,
unreasoning
,
unjustified
terror
which
paralyzes
needed
effort
to
convert
retreat
into
advance
.
in
every
dark
hour
of
our
national
life
a
leadership
of
frankness
and
vigor
ha
met
with
that
understanding
and
support
of
the
people
themselves
which
is
essential
to
victory
.
i
am
convinced
that
you
will
again
give
that
support
to
leadership
in
these
critical
day
.
in
such
a
spirit
on
my
part
and
on
yours
we
face
our
common
difficulty
.
they
concern
,
thank
god
,
only
material
thing
.
value
have
shrunken
to
fantastic
level
;
tax
have
risen
;
our
ability
to
pay
ha
fallen
;
government
of
all
kind
is
faced
by
serious
curtailment
of
income
;
the
mean
of
exchange
are
frozen
in
the
current
of
trade
;
the
withered
leaf
of
industrial
enterprise
lie
on
every
side
;
farmer
find
no
market
for
their
produce
;
the
saving
of
many
year
in
thousand
of
family
are
gone
.
more
important
,
a
host
of
unemployed
citizen
face
the
grim
problem
of
existence
,
and
an
equally
great
number
toil
with
little
return
.
only
a
foolish
optimist
can
deny
the
dark
reality
of
the
moment
.
yet
our
distress
come
from
no
failure
of
substance
.
we
are
stricken
by
no
plague
of
locust
.
compared
with
the
peril
which
our
forefather
conquered
because
they
believed
and
were
not
afraid
,
we
have
still
much
to
be
thankful
for
.
nature
still
offer
her
bounty
and
human
effort
have
multiplied
it
.
plenty
is
at
our
doorstep
,
but
a
generous
use
of
it
languishes
in
the
very
sight
of
the
supply
.
primarily
this
is
because
ruler
of
the
exchange
of
mankind
's
good
have
failed
through
their
own
stubbornness
and
their
own
incompetence
,
have
admitted
their
failure
,
and
have
abdicated
.
practice
of
the
unscrupulous
money
changer
stand
indicted
in
the
court
of
public
opinion
,
rejected
by
the
heart
and
mind
of
men
.
true
they
have
tried
,
but
their
effort
have
been
cast
in
the
pattern
of
an
outworn
tradition
.
faced
by
failure
of
credit
they
have
proposed
only
the
lending
of
more
money
.
stripped
of
the
lure
of
profit
by
which
to
induce
our
people
to
follow
their
false
leadership
,
they
have
resorted
to
exhortation
,
pleading
tearfully
for
restored
confidence
.
they
know
only
the
rule
of
a
generation
of
self-seeker
.
they
have
no
vision
,
and
when
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
.
the
money
changer
have
fled
from
their
high
seat
in
the
temple
of
our
civilization
.
we
may
now
restore
that
temple
to
the
ancient
truth
.
the
measure
of
the
restoration
lie
in
the
extent
to
which
we
apply
social
value
more
noble
than
mere
monetary
profit
.
happiness
lie
not
in
the
mere
possession
of
money
;
it
lie
in
the
joy
of
achievement
,
in
the
thrill
of
creative
effort
.
the
joy
and
moral
stimulation
of
work
no
longer
must
be
forgotten
in
the
mad
chase
of
evanescent
profit
.
these
dark
day
will
be
worth
all
they
cost
u
if
they
teach
u
that
our
true
destiny
is
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
to
ourselves
and
to
our
fellow
men
.
recognition
of
the
falsity
of
material
wealth
a
the
standard
of
success
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
abandonment
of
the
false
belief
that
public
office
and
high
political
position
are
to
be
valued
only
by
the
standard
of
pride
of
place
and
personal
profit
;
and
there
must
be
an
end
to
a
conduct
in
banking
and
in
business
which
too
often
ha
given
to
a
sacred
trust
the
likeness
of
callous
and
selfish
wrongdoing
.
small
wonder
that
confidence
languishes
,
for
it
thrives
only
on
honesty
,
on
honor
,
on
the
sacredness
of
obligation
,
on
faithful
protection
,
on
unselfish
performance
;
without
them
it
can
not
live
.
restoration
call
,
however
,
not
for
change
in
ethic
alone
.
this
nation
asks
for
action
,
and
action
now
.
our
greatest
primary
task
is
to
put
people
to
work
.
this
is
no
unsolvable
problem
if
we
face
it
wisely
and
courageously
.
it
can
be
accomplished
in
part
by
direct
recruiting
by
the
government
itself
,
treating
the
task
a
we
would
treat
the
emergency
of
a
war
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
through
this
employment
,
accomplishing
greatly
needed
project
to
stimulate
and
reorganize
the
use
of
our
natural
resource
.
hand
in
hand
with
this
we
must
frankly
recognize
the
overbalance
of
population
in
our
industrial
center
and
,
by
engaging
on
a
national
scale
in
a
redistribution
,
endeavor
to
provide
a
better
use
of
the
land
for
those
best
fitted
for
the
land
.
the
task
can
be
helped
by
definite
effort
to
raise
the
value
of
agricultural
product
and
with
this
the
power
to
purchase
the
output
of
our
city
.
it
can
be
helped
by
preventing
realistically
the
tragedy
of
the
growing
loss
through
foreclosure
of
our
small
home
and
our
farm
.
it
can
be
helped
by
insistence
that
the
federal
,
state
,
and
local
government
act
forthwith
on
the
demand
that
their
cost
be
drastically
reduced
.
it
can
be
helped
by
the
unifying
of
relief
activity
which
today
are
often
scattered
,
uneconomical
,
and
unequal
.
it
can
be
helped
by
national
planning
for
and
supervision
of
all
form
of
transportation
and
of
communication
and
other
utility
which
have
a
definitely
public
character
.
there
are
many
way
in
which
it
can
be
helped
,
but
it
can
never
be
helped
merely
by
talking
about
it
.
we
must
act
and
act
quickly
.
finally
,
in
our
progress
toward
a
resumption
of
work
we
require
two
safeguard
against
a
return
of
the
evil
of
the
old
order
:
there
must
be
a
strict
supervision
of
all
banking
and
credit
and
investment
,
so
that
there
will
be
an
end
to
speculation
with
other
people
's
money
;
and
there
must
be
provision
for
an
adequate
but
sound
currency
.
these
are
the
line
of
attack
.
i
shall
presently
urge
upon
a
new
congress
,
in
special
session
,
detailed
measure
for
their
fulfillment
,
and
i
shall
seek
the
immediate
assistance
of
the
several
state
.
through
this
program
of
action
we
address
ourselves
to
putting
our
own
national
house
in
order
and
making
income
balance
outgo
.
our
international
trade
relation
,
though
vastly
important
,
are
in
point
of
time
and
necessity
secondary
to
the
establishment
of
a
sound
national
economy
.
i
favor
a
a
practical
policy
the
putting
of
first
thing
first
.
i
shall
spare
no
effort
to
restore
world
trade
by
international
economic
readjustment
,
but
the
emergency
at
home
can
not
wait
on
that
accomplishment
.
the
basic
thought
that
guide
these
specific
mean
of
national
recovery
is
not
narrowly
nationalistic
.
it
is
the
insistence
,
a
a
first
consideration
,
upon
the
interdependence
of
the
various
element
in
and
part
of
the
united
states-a
recognition
of
the
old
and
permanently
important
manifestation
of
the
american
spirit
of
the
pioneer
.
it
is
the
way
to
recovery
.
it
is
the
immediate
way
.
it
is
the
strongest
assurance
that
the
recovery
will
endure
.
in
the
field
of
world
policy
i
would
dedicate
this
nation
to
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor—the
neighbor
who
resolutely
respect
himself
and
,
because
he
doe
so
,
respect
the
right
of
others—the
neighbor
who
respect
his
obligation
and
respect
the
sanctity
of
his
agreement
in
and
with
a
world
of
neighbor
.
if
i
read
the
temper
of
our
people
correctly
,
we
now
realize
a
we
have
never
realized
before
our
interdependence
on
each
other
;
that
we
can
not
merely
take
but
we
must
give
a
well
;
that
if
we
are
to
go
forward
,
we
must
move
a
a
trained
and
loyal
army
willing
to
sacrifice
for
the
good
of
a
common
discipline
,
because
without
such
discipline
no
progress
is
made
,
no
leadership
becomes
effective
.
we
are
,
i
know
,
ready
and
willing
to
submit
our
life
and
property
to
such
discipline
,
because
it
make
possible
a
leadership
which
aim
at
a
larger
good
.
this
i
propose
to
offer
,
pledging
that
the
larger
purpose
will
bind
upon
u
all
a
a
sacred
obligation
with
a
unity
of
duty
hitherto
evoked
only
in
time
of
armed
strife
.
with
this
pledge
taken
,
i
assume
unhesitatingly
the
leadership
of
this
great
army
of
our
people
dedicated
to
a
disciplined
attack
upon
our
common
problem
.
action
in
this
image
and
to
this
end
is
feasible
under
the
form
of
government
which
we
have
inherited
from
our
ancestor
.
our
constitution
is
so
simple
and
practical
that
it
is
possible
always
to
meet
extraordinary
need
by
change
in
emphasis
and
arrangement
without
loss
of
essential
form
.
that
is
why
our
constitutional
system
ha
proved
itself
the
most
superbly
enduring
political
mechanism
the
modern
world
ha
produced
.
it
ha
met
every
stress
of
vast
expansion
of
territory
,
of
foreign
war
,
of
bitter
internal
strife
,
of
world
relation
.
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
normal
balance
of
executive
and
legislative
authority
may
be
wholly
adequate
to
meet
the
unprecedented
task
before
u
.
but
it
may
be
that
an
unprecedented
demand
and
need
for
undelayed
action
may
call
for
temporary
departure
from
that
normal
balance
of
public
procedure
.
i
am
prepared
under
my
constitutional
duty
to
recommend
the
measure
that
a
stricken
nation
in
the
midst
of
a
stricken
world
may
require
.
these
measure
,
or
such
other
measure
a
the
congress
may
build
out
of
it
experience
and
wisdom
,
i
shall
seek
,
within
my
constitutional
authority
,
to
bring
to
speedy
adoption
.
but
in
the
event
that
the
congress
shall
fail
to
take
one
of
these
two
course
,
and
in
the
event
that
the
national
emergency
is
still
critical
,
i
shall
not
evade
the
clear
course
of
duty
that
will
then
confront
me
.
i
shall
ask
the
congress
for
the
one
remaining
instrument
to
meet
the
crisis—broad
executive
power
to
wage
a
war
against
the
emergency
,
a
great
a
the
power
that
would
be
given
to
me
if
we
were
in
fact
invaded
by
a
foreign
foe
.
for
the
trust
reposed
in
me
i
will
return
the
courage
and
the
devotion
that
befit
the
time
.
i
can
do
no
le
.
we
face
the
arduous
day
that
lie
before
u
in
the
warm
courage
of
national
unity
;
with
the
clear
consciousness
of
seeking
old
and
precious
moral
value
;
with
the
clean
satisfaction
that
come
from
the
stern
performance
of
duty
by
old
and
young
alike
.
we
aim
at
the
assurance
of
a
rounded
and
permanent
national
life
.
we
do
not
distrust
the
future
of
essential
democracy
.
the
people
of
the
united
state
have
not
failed
.
in
their
need
they
have
registered
a
mandate
that
they
want
direct
,
vigorous
action
.
they
have
asked
for
discipline
and
direction
under
leadership
.
they
have
made
me
the
present
instrument
of
their
wish
.
in
the
spirit
of
the
gift
i
take
it
.
in
this
dedication
of
a
nation
we
humbly
ask
the
blessing
of
god
.
may
he
protect
each
and
every
one
of
u
.
may
he
guide
me
in
the
day
to
come
.
