fellow-citizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representative
:
in
reviewing
the
present
state
of
our
country
,
our
attention
can
not
be
withheld
from
the
effect
produced
by
peculiar
season
which
have
very
generally
impaired
the
annual
gift
of
the
earth
and
threatened
scarcity
in
particular
district
.
such
,
however
,
is
the
variety
of
soil
,
of
climate
,
and
of
product
within
our
extensive
limit
that
the
aggregate
resource
for
subsistence
are
more
than
sufficient
for
the
aggregate
want
.
and
a
far
a
an
economy
of
consumption
,
more
than
usual
,
may
be
necessary
,
our
thankfulness
is
due
to
providence
for
what
is
far
more
than
a
compensation
,
in
the
remarkable
health
which
ha
distinguished
the
present
year
.
amidst
the
advantage
which
have
succeeded
the
peace
of
europe
,
and
that
of
the
united
state
with
great
britain
,
in
a
general
invigoration
of
industry
among
u
and
in
the
extension
of
our
commerce
,
the
value
of
which
is
more
and
more
disclosing
itself
to
commercial
nation
,
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
a
depression
is
experienced
by
particular
branch
of
our
manufacture
and
by
a
portion
of
our
navigation
.
a
the
first
proceeds
in
an
essential
degree
from
an
excess
of
imported
merchandise
,
which
carry
a
check
in
it
own
tendency
,
the
cause
in
it
present
extent
can
not
be
very
long
in
duration
.
the
evil
will
not
,
however
,
be
viewed
by
congress
without
a
recollection
that
manufacturing
establishment
,
if
suffered
to
sink
too
low
or
languish
too
long
,
may
not
revive
after
the
cause
shall
have
ceased
,
and
that
in
the
vicissitude
of
human
affair
situation
may
recur
in
which
a
dependence
on
foreign
source
for
indispensable
supply
may
be
among
the
most
serious
embarrassment
.
the
depressed
state
of
our
navigation
is
to
be
ascribed
in
a
material
degree
to
it
exclusion
from
the
colonial
port
of
the
nation
most
extensively
connected
with
u
in
commerce
,
and
from
the
indirect
operation
of
that
exclusion
.
previous
to
the
late
convention
at
london
between
the
united
state
and
great
britain
the
relative
state
of
the
navigation
law
of
the
two
country
,
growing
out
of
the
treaty
of
1794
,
had
given
to
the
british
navigation
a
material
advantage
over
the
american
in
the
intercourse
between
the
american
port
and
british
port
in
europe
.
the
convention
of
london
equalized
the
law
of
the
two
country
relating
to
those
port
,
leaving
the
intercourse
between
our
port
and
the
port
of
the
british
colony
subject
,
a
before
,
to
the
respective
regulation
of
the
party
.
the
british
government
enforcing
now
regulation
which
prohibit
a
trade
between
it
colony
and
the
united
state
in
american
vessel
,
whilst
they
permit
a
trade
in
british
vessel
,
the
american
navigation
loses
accordingly
,
and
the
loss
is
augmented
by
the
advantage
which
is
given
to
the
british
competition
over
the
american
in
the
navigation
between
our
port
and
british
port
in
europe
by
the
circuitous
voyage
enjoyed
by
the
one
and
not
enjoyed
by
the
other
.
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule
of
reciprocity
applied
to
one
branch
of
the
commercial
intercourse
ha
been
pressed
on
our
part
a
equally
applicable
to
both
branch
;
but
it
is
ascertained
that
the
british
cabinet
decline
all
negotiation
on
the
subject
,
with
a
disavowal
,
however
,
of
any
disposition
to
view
in
an
unfriendly
light
whatever
countervailing
regulation
the
united
state
may
oppose
to
the
regulation
of
which
they
complain
.
the
wisdom
of
the
legislature
will
decide
on
the
course
which
,
under
these
circumstance
,
is
prescribed
by
a
joint
regard
to
the
amicable
relation
between
the
two
nation
and
to
the
just
interest
of
the
united
state
.
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
state
,
generally
,
that
we
remain
in
amity
with
foreign
power
.
an
occurrence
ha
indeed
taken
place
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
,
if
sanctioned
by
the
spanish
government
,
may
make
an
exception
a
to
that
power
.
according
to
the
report
of
our
naval
commander
on
that
station
,
one
of
our
public
armed
vessel
wa
attacked
by
an
over-powering
force
under
a
spanish
commander
,
and
the
american
flag
,
with
the
officer
and
crew
,
insulted
in
a
manner
calling
for
prompt
reparation
.
this
ha
been
demanded
.
in
the
mean
time
a
frigate
and
a
smaller
vessel
of
war
have
been
ordered
into
that
gulf
for
the
protection
of
our
commerce
.
it
would
be
improper
to
omit
that
the
representative
of
his
catholic
majesty
in
the
united
state
lost
no
time
in
giving
the
strongest
assurance
that
no
hostile
order
could
have
emanated
from
his
government
,
and
that
it
will
be
a
ready
to
do
a
to
expect
whatever
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
friendly
relation
of
the
two
country
shall
be
found
to
require
.
the
posture
of
our
affair
with
algiers
at
the
present
moment
is
not
known
.
the
day
,
drawing
pretext
from
circumstance
for
which
the
united
state
were
not
answerable
,
addressed
a
letter
to
this
government
declaring
the
treaty
last
concluded
with
him
to
have
been
annulled
by
our
violation
of
it
,
and
presenting
a
the
alternative
war
or
a
renewal
of
the
former
treaty
,
which
stipulated
,
among
other
thing
,
an
annual
tribute
.
the
answer
,
with
an
explicit
declaration
that
the
united
state
preferred
war
to
tribute
,
required
his
recognition
and
observance
of
the
treaty
last
made
,
which
abolishes
tribute
and
the
slavery
of
our
captured
citizen
.
the
result
of
the
answer
ha
not
been
received
.
should
he
renew
his
warfare
on
our
commerce
,
we
rely
on
the
protection
it
will
find
in
our
naval
force
actually
in
the
mediterranean
.
with
the
other
barbary
state
our
affair
have
undergone
no
change
.
the
indian
tribe
within
our
limit
appear
also
disposed
to
remain
at
peace
.
from
several
of
them
purchase
of
land
have
been
made
particularly
favorable
to
the
wish
and
security
of
our
frontier
settlement
,
a
well
a
to
the
general
interest
of
the
nation
.
in
some
instance
the
title
,
though
not
supported
by
due
proof
,
and
clashing
those
of
one
tribe
with
the
claim
of
another
,
have
been
extinguished
by
double
purchase
,
the
benevolent
policy
of
the
united
state
preferring
the
augmented
expense
to
the
hazard
of
doing
injustice
or
to
the
enforcement
of
justice
against
a
feeble
and
untutored
people
by
mean
involving
or
threatening
an
effusion
of
blood
.
i
am
happy
to
ad
that
the
tranquillity
which
ha
been
restored
among
the
tribe
themselves
,
a
well
a
between
them
and
our
own
population
,
will
favor
the
resumption
of
the
work
of
civilization
which
had
made
an
encouraging
progress
among
some
tribe
,
and
that
the
facility
is
increasing
for
extending
that
divided
and
individual
ownership
,
which
exists
now
in
movable
property
only
,
to
the
soil
itself
,
and
of
thus
establishing
in
the
culture
and
improvement
of
it
the
true
foundation
for
a
transit
from
the
habit
of
the
savage
to
the
art
and
comfort
of
social
life
.
a
a
subject
of
the
highest
importance
to
the
national
welfare
,
i
must
again
earnestly
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
a
reorganization
of
the
militia
on
a
plan
which
will
form
it
into
class
according
to
the
period
of
life
more
or
le
adapted
to
military
service
.
an
efficient
militia
is
authorized
and
contemplated
by
the
constitution
and
required
by
the
spirit
and
safety
of
free
government
.
the
present
organization
of
our
militia
is
universally
regarded
a
le
efficient
than
it
ought
to
be
made
,
and
no
organization
can
be
better
calculated
to
give
to
it
it
due
force
than
a
classification
which
will
assign
the
foremost
place
in
the
defense
of
the
country
to
that
portion
of
it
citizen
whose
activity
and
animation
best
enable
them
to
rally
to
it
standard
.
besides
the
consideration
that
a
time
of
peace
is
the
time
when
the
change
can
be
made
with
most
convenience
and
equity
,
it
will
now
be
aided
by
the
experience
of
a
recent
war
in
which
the
militia
bore
so
interesting
a
part
.
congress
will
call
to
mind
that
no
adequate
provision
ha
yet
been
made
for
the
uniformity
of
weight
and
measure
also
contemplated
by
the
constitution
.
the
great
utility
of
a
standard
fixed
in
it
nature
and
founded
on
the
easy
rule
of
decimal
proportion
is
sufficiently
obvious
.
it
led
the
government
at
an
early
stage
to
preparatory
step
for
introducing
it
,
and
a
completion
of
the
work
will
be
a
just
title
to
the
public
gratitude
.
the
importance
which
i
have
attached
to
the
establishment
of
a
university
within
this
district
on
a
scale
and
for
object
worthy
of
the
american
nation
induces
me
to
renew
my
recommendation
of
it
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
.
and
i
particularly
invite
again
their
attention
to
the
expediency
of
exercising
their
existing
power
,
and
,
where
necessary
,
of
resorting
to
the
prescribed
mode
of
enlarging
them
,
in
order
to
effectuate
a
comprehensive
system
of
road
and
canal
,
such
a
will
have
the
effect
of
drawing
more
closely
together
every
part
of
our
country
by
promoting
intercourse
and
improvement
and
by
increasing
the
share
of
every
part
in
the
common
stock
of
national
prosperity
.
occurrence
having
taken
place
which
shew
that
the
statutory
provision
for
the
dispensation
of
criminal
justice
are
deficient
in
relation
both
to
place
and
to
person
under
the
exclusive
cognizance
of
the
national
authority
,
an
amendment
of
the
law
embracing
such
case
will
merit
the
earliest
attention
of
the
legislature
.
it
will
be
a
seasonable
occasion
also
for
inquiring
how
far
legislative
interposition
may
be
further
requisite
in
providing
penalty
for
offense
designated
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
statute
,
and
to
which
either
no
penalty
are
annexed
or
none
with
sufficient
certainty
.
and
i
submit
to
the
wisdom
of
congress
whether
a
more
enlarged
revisal
of
the
criminal
code
be
not
expedient
for
the
purpose
of
mitigating
in
certain
case
penalty
which
were
adopted
into
it
antecedent
to
experiment
and
example
which
justify
and
recommend
a
more
lenient
policy
.
the
united
state
,
having
been
the
first
to
abolish
within
the
extent
of
their
authority
the
transportation
of
the
native
of
africa
into
slavery
,
by
prohibiting
the
introduction
of
slave
and
by
punishing
their
citizen
participating
in
the
traffic
,
can
not
but
be
gratified
at
the
progress
made
by
concurrent
effort
of
other
nation
toward
a
general
suppression
of
so
great
an
evil
.
they
must
feel
at
the
same
time
the
greater
solicitude
to
give
the
fullest
efficacy
to
their
own
regulation
.
with
that
view
,
the
interposition
of
congress
appears
to
be
required
by
the
violation
and
evasion
which
it
is
suggested
are
chargeable
on
unworthy
citizen
who
mingle
in
the
slave
trade
under
foreign
flag
and
with
foreign
port
,
and
by
collusive
importation
of
slave
into
the
united
state
through
adjoining
port
and
territory
.
i
present
the
subject
to
congress
with
a
full
assurance
of
their
disposition
to
apply
all
the
remedy
which
can
be
afforded
by
an
amendment
of
the
law
.
the
regulation
which
were
intended
to
guard
against
abuse
of
a
kindred
character
in
the
trade
between
the
several
state
ought
also
to
be
rendered
more
effectual
for
their
humane
object
.
to
these
recommendation
i
add
,
for
the
consideration
of
congress
,
the
expediency
of
a
remodification
of
the
judiciary
establishment
,
and
of
an
additional
department
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
.
the
first
is
called
for
by
the
accruing
business
which
necessarily
swell
the
duty
of
the
federal
court
,
and
by
the
great
and
widening
space
within
which
justice
is
to
be
dispensed
by
them
.
the
time
seems
to
have
arrived
which
claim
for
member
of
the
supreme
court
a
relief
from
itinerary
fatigue
,
incompatible
a
well
with
the
age
which
a
portion
of
them
will
always
have
attained
a
with
the
research
and
preparation
which
are
due
to
their
station
and
to
the
juridical
reputation
of
their
country
.
and
consideration
equally
cogent
require
a
more
convenient
organization
of
the
subordinate
tribunal
,
which
may
be
accomplished
without
an
objectionable
increase
of
the
number
or
expense
of
the
judge
.
the
extent
and
variety
of
executive
business
also
accumulating
with
the
progress
of
our
country
and
it
growing
population
call
for
an
additional
department
,
to
be
charged
with
duty
now
over-
burdening
other
department
and
with
such
a
have
not
been
annexed
to
any
department
.
the
course
of
experience
recommends
,
a
another
improvement
in
the
executive
establishment
,
that
the
provision
for
the
station
of
attorney-general
,
whose
residence
at
the
seat
of
government
,
official
connection
with
it
,
and
the
management
of
the
public
business
before
the
judiciary
preclude
an
extensive
participation
in
professional
emolument
,
be
made
more
adequate
to
his
service
and
his
relinquishment
,
and
that
,
with
a
view
to
his
reasonable
accommodation
and
to
a
proper
depository
of
his
official
opinion
and
proceeding
,
there
be
included
in
the
provision
the
usual
appurtenance
to
a
public
office
.
in
directing
the
legislative
attention
to
the
state
of
the
finance
it
is
a
subject
of
great
gratification
to
find
that
even
within
the
short
period
which
ha
elapsed
since
the
return
of
peace
the
revenue
ha
far
exceeded
all
the
current
demand
upon
the
treasury
,
and
that
under
any
probable
diminution
of
it
future
annual
product
which
the
vicissitude
of
commerce
may
occasion
it
will
afford
an
ample
fund
for
the
effectual
and
early
extinguishment
of
the
public
debt
.
it
ha
been
estimated
that
during
the
year
1816
the
actual
receipt
of
revenue
at
the
treasury
,
including
the
balance
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
,
and
excluding
the
proceeds
of
loan
and
treasury
note
,
will
amount
to
about
the
sum
of
$
47,000,000
;
that
during
the
same
year
the
actual
payment
at
the
treasury
,
including
the
payment
of
the
arrearages
of
the
war
department
a
well
a
the
payment
of
a
considerable
excess
beyond
the
annual
appropriation
,
will
amount
to
about
the
sum
of
$
38m
,
and
that
consequently
at
the
close
of
the
year
there
will
be
a
surplus
in
the
treasury
of
about
the
sum
of
$
9m
.
the
operation
of
the
treasury
continued
to
be
obstructed
by
difficulty
arising
from
the
condition
of
the
national
currency
,
but
they
have
nevertheless
been
effectual
to
a
beneficial
extent
in
the
reduction
of
the
public
debt
and
the
establishment
of
the
public
credit
.
the
floating
debt
of
treasury
note
and
temporary
loan
will
soon
be
entirely
discharged
.
the
aggregate
of
the
funded
debt
,
composed
of
debt
incurred
during
the
war
of
1776
and
1812
,
ha
been
estimated
with
reference
to
the
first
of
january
next
at
a
sum
not
exceeding
$
110m
.
the
ordinary
annual
expense
of
the
government
for
the
maintenance
of
all
it
institution
,
civil
,
military
,
and
naval
,
have
been
estimated
at
a
sum
$
20m
,
and
the
permanent
revenue
to
be
derived
from
all
the
existing
source
ha
been
estimated
at
a
sum
of
$
25m
.
upon
this
general
view
of
the
subject
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
only
wanting
to
the
fiscal
prosperity
of
the
government
the
restoration
of
an
uniform
medium
of
exchange
.
the
resource
and
the
faith
of
the
nation
,
displayed
in
the
system
which
congress
ha
established
,
insure
respect
and
confidence
both
at
home
and
abroad
.
the
local
accumulation
of
the
revenue
have
already
enabled
the
treasury
to
meet
the
public
engagement
in
the
local
currency
of
most
of
the
state
,
and
it
is
expected
that
the
same
cause
will
produce
the
same
effect
throughout
the
union
;
but
for
the
interest
of
the
community
at
large
,
a
well
a
for
the
purpose
of
the
treasury
,
it
is
essential
that
the
nation
should
posse
a
currency
of
equal
value
,
credit
,
and
use
wherever
it
may
circulate
.
the
constitution
ha
intrusted
congress
exclusively
with
the
power
of
creating
and
regulating
a
currency
of
that
description
,
and
the
measure
which
were
taken
during
the
last
session
in
execution
of
the
power
give
every
promise
of
success
.
the
bank
of
the
united
state
ha
been
organized
under
auspex
the
most
favorable
,
and
can
not
fail
to
be
an
important
auxiliary
to
those
measure
.
for
a
more
enlarged
view
of
the
public
finance
,
with
a
view
of
the
measure
pursued
by
the
treasury
department
previous
to
the
resignation
of
the
late
secretary
,
i
transmit
an
extract
from
the
last
report
of
that
officer
.
congress
will
perceive
in
it
ample
proof
of
the
solid
foundation
on
which
the
financial
prosperity
of
the
nation
rest
,
and
will
do
justice
to
the
distinguished
ability
and
successful
exertion
with
which
the
duty
of
the
department
were
executed
during
a
period
remarkable
for
it
difficulty
and
it
peculiar
perplexity
.
the
period
of
my
retiring
from
the
public
service
being
at
little
distance
,
i
shall
find
no
occasion
more
proper
than
the
present
for
expressing
to
my
fellow
citizen
my
deep
sense
of
the
continued
confidence
and
kind
support
which
i
have
received
from
them
.
my
grateful
recollection
of
these
distinguished
mark
of
their
favorable
regard
can
never
cease
,
and
with
the
consciousness
that
,
if
i
have
not
served
my
country
with
greater
ability
,
i
have
served
it
with
a
sincere
devotion
will
accompany
me
a
a
source
of
unfailing
gratification
.
happily
,
i
shall
carry
with
me
from
the
public
theater
other
source
,
which
those
who
love
their
country
most
will
best
appreciate
.
i
shall
behold
it
blessed
with
tranquillity
and
prosperity
at
home
and
with
peace
and
respect
abroad
.
i
can
indulge
the
proud
reflection
that
the
american
people
have
reached
in
safety
and
success
their
40th
year
a
an
independent
nation
;
that
for
nearly
an
entire
generation
they
have
had
experience
of
their
present
constitution
,
the
off-spring
of
their
undisturbed
deliberation
and
of
their
free
choice
;
that
they
have
found
it
to
bear
the
trial
of
adverse
a
well
a
prosperous
circumstance
;
to
contain
in
it
combination
of
the
federate
and
elective
principle
a
reconcilement
of
public
strength
with
individual
liberty
,
of
national
power
for
the
defense
of
national
right
with
a
security
against
war
of
injustice
,
of
ambition
,
and
vain-glory
in
the
fundamental
provision
which
subject
all
question
of
war
to
the
will
of
the
nation
itself
,
which
is
to
pay
it
cost
and
feel
it
calamity
.
nor
is
it
le
a
peculiar
felicity
of
this
constitution
,
so
dear
to
u
all
,
that
it
is
found
to
be
capable
,
without
losing
it
vital
energy
,
of
expanding
itself
over
a
spacious
territory
with
the
increase
and
expansion
of
the
community
for
whose
benefit
it
wa
established
.
and
may
i
not
be
allowed
to
add
to
this
gratifying
spectacle
that
i
shall
read
in
the
character
of
the
american
people
,
in
their
devotion
to
true
liberty
and
to
the
constitution
which
is
it
palladium
,
sure
presage
that
the
destined
career
of
my
country
will
exhibit
a
government
pursuing
the
public
good
a
it
sole
object
,
and
regulating
it
mean
by
the
great
principle
consecrated
in
it
charger
and
by
those
moral
principle
to
which
they
are
so
well
allied
;
a
government
which
watch
over
the
purity
of
election
,
the
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
,
the
trial
by
jury
,
and
the
equal
interdict
against
encroachment
and
compact
between
religion
and
the
state
;
which
maintains
inviolably
the
maxim
of
public
faith
,
the
security
of
person
and
property
,
and
encourages
in
every
authorized
mode
the
general
diffusion
of
knowledge
which
guarantee
to
public
liberty
it
permanency
and
to
those
who
posse
the
blessing
the
true
enjoyment
of
it
;
a
government
which
avoids
intrusion
on
the
internal
repose
of
other
nation
,
and
repels
them
from
it
own
;
which
doe
justice
to
all
nation
with
a
readiness
equal
to
the
firmness
with
which
it
requires
justice
from
them
;
and
which
,
whilst
it
refines
it
domestic
code
from
every
ingredient
not
congenial
with
the
precept
of
an
enlightened
age
and
the
sentiment
of
a
virtuous
people
,
seek
by
appeal
to
reason
and
by
it
liberal
example
to
infuse
into
the
law
which
governs
the
civilized
world
a
spirit
which
may
diminish
the
frequency
or
circumscribe
the
calamity
of
war
,
and
meliorate
the
social
and
beneficent
relation
of
peace
;
a
government
,
in
a
word
,
whose
conduct
within
and
without
may
bespeak
the
most
noble
of
ambition
-
that
of
promoting
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
man
.
these
contemplation
,
sweetening
the
remnant
of
my
day
,
will
animate
my
prayer
for
the
happiness
of
my
beloved
country
,
and
a
perpetuity
of
the
institution
under
which
it
is
enjoyed
.
