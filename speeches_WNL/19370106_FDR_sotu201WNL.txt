mr.
president
,
mr.
speaker
,
member
of
the
congress
of
the
united
state
:
for
the
first
time
in
our
national
history
a
president
delivers
his
annual
message
to
a
new
congress
within
a
fortnight
of
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
office
.
while
there
is
no
change
in
the
presidency
this
year
,
change
will
occur
in
future
year
.
it
is
my
belief
that
under
this
new
constitutional
practice
,
the
president
should
in
every
fourth
year
,
in
so
far
a
seems
reasonable
,
review
the
existing
state
of
our
national
affair
and
outline
broad
future
problem
,
leaving
specific
recommendation
for
future
legislation
to
be
made
by
the
president
about
to
be
inaugurated
.
at
this
time
,
however
,
circumstance
of
the
moment
compel
me
to
ask
your
immediate
consideration
of
:
first
,
measure
extending
the
life
of
certain
authorization
and
power
which
,
under
present
statute
,
expire
within
a
few
week
;
second
,
an
addition
to
the
existing
neutrality
act
to
cover
specific
point
raised
by
the
unfortunate
civil
strife
in
spain
;
and
,
third
,
a
deficiency
appropriation
bill
for
which
i
shall
submit
estimate
this
week
.
in
march
,
1933
,
the
problem
which
faced
our
nation
and
which
only
our
national
government
had
the
resource
to
meet
were
more
serious
even
than
appeared
on
the
surface
.
it
wa
not
only
that
the
visible
mechanism
of
economic
life
had
broken
down
.
more
disturbing
wa
the
fact
that
long
neglect
of
the
need
of
the
underprivileged
had
brought
too
many
of
our
people
to
the
verge
of
doubt
a
to
the
successful
adaptation
of
our
historic
tradition
to
the
complex
modern
world
.
in
that
lay
a
challenge
to
our
democratic
form
of
government
itself
.
ours
wa
the
task
to
prove
that
democracy
could
be
made
to
function
in
the
world
of
today
a
effectively
a
in
the
simpler
world
of
a
hundred
year
ago
.
ours
wa
the
task
to
do
more
than
to
argue
a
theory
.
the
time
required
the
confident
answer
of
performance
to
those
whose
instinctive
faith
in
humanity
made
them
want
to
believe
that
in
the
long
run
democracy
would
prove
superior
to
more
extreme
form
of
government
a
a
process
of
getting
action
when
action
wa
wisdom
,
without
the
spiritual
sacrifice
which
those
other
form
of
government
exact
.
that
challenge
we
met
.
to
meet
it
required
unprecedented
activity
under
federal
leadership
to
end
abuse
,
to
restore
a
large
measure
of
material
prosperity
,
to
give
new
faith
to
million
of
our
citizen
who
had
been
traditionally
taught
to
expect
that
democracy
would
provide
continuously
wider
opportunity
and
continuously
greater
security
in
a
world
where
science
wa
continuously
making
material
rich
more
available
to
man
.
in
the
many
method
of
attack
with
which
we
met
these
problem
,
you
and
i
,
by
mutual
understanding
and
by
determination
to
cooperate
,
helped
to
make
democracy
succeed
by
refusing
to
permit
unnecessary
disagreement
to
arise
between
two
of
our
branch
of
government
.
that
spirit
of
cooperation
wa
able
to
solve
difficulty
of
extraordinary
magnitude
and
ramification
with
few
important
error
,
and
at
a
cost
cheap
when
measured
by
the
immediate
necessity
and
the
eventual
result
.
i
look
forward
to
a
continuance
of
that
cooperation
in
the
next
four
year
.
i
look
forward
also
to
a
continuance
of
the
basis
of
that
cooperation-
mutual
respect
for
each
other
's
proper
sphere
of
functioning
in
a
democracy
which
is
working
well
,
and
a
common-sense
realization
of
the
need
for
play
in
the
joint
of
the
machine
.
on
that
basis
,
it
is
within
the
right
of
the
congress
to
determine
which
of
the
many
new
activity
shall
be
continued
or
abandoned
,
increased
or
curtailed
.
on
that
same
basis
,
the
president
alone
ha
the
responsibility
for
their
administration
.
i
find
that
this
task
of
executive
management
ha
reached
the
point
where
our
administrative
machinery
need
comprehensive
overhauling
.
i
shall
,
therefore
,
shortly
address
the
congress
more
fully
in
regard
to
modernizing
and
improving
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
.
that
cooperation
of
the
past
four
year
between
the
congress
and
the
president
ha
aimed
at
the
fulfillment
of
a
twofold
policy
:
first
,
economic
recovery
through
many
kind
of
assistance
to
agriculture
,
industry
and
banking
;
and
,
second
,
deliberate
improvement
in
the
personal
security
and
opportunity
of
the
great
mass
of
our
people
.
the
recovery
we
sought
wa
not
to
be
merely
temporary
.
it
wa
to
be
a
recovery
protected
from
the
cause
of
previous
disaster
.
with
that
aim
in
view—to
prevent
a
future
similar
crisis-you
and
i
joined
in
a
series
of
enactments—safe
banking
and
sound
currency
,
the
guarantee
of
bank
deposit
,
protection
for
the
investor
in
security
,
the
removal
of
the
threat
of
agricultural
surplus
,
insistence
on
collective
bargaining
,
the
outlawing
of
sweat
shop
,
child
labor
and
unfair
trade
practice
,
and
the
beginning
of
security
for
the
aged
and
the
worker
.
nor
wa
the
recovery
we
sought
merely
a
purposeless
whirring
of
machinery
.
it
is
important
,
of
course
,
that
every
man
and
woman
in
the
country
be
able
to
find
work
,
that
every
factory
run
,
that
business
and
farming
a
a
whole
earn
profit
.
but
government
in
a
democratic
nation
doe
not
exist
solely
,
or
even
primarily
,
for
that
purpose
.
it
is
not
enough
that
the
wheel
turn
.
they
must
carry
u
in
the
direction
of
a
greater
satisfaction
in
life
for
the
average
man
.
the
deeper
purpose
of
democratic
government
is
to
assist
a
many
of
it
citizen
a
possible
,
especially
those
who
need
it
most
,
to
improve
their
condition
of
life
,
to
retain
all
personal
liberty
which
doe
not
adversely
affect
their
neighbor
,
and
to
pursue
the
happiness
which
come
with
security
and
an
opportunity
for
recreation
and
culture
.
even
with
our
present
recovery
we
are
far
from
the
goal
of
that
deeper
purpose
.
there
are
far-reaching
problem
still
with
u
for
which
democracy
must
find
solution
if
it
is
to
consider
itself
successful
.
for
example
,
many
million
of
american
still
live
in
habitation
which
not
only
fail
to
provide
the
physical
benefit
of
modern
civilization
but
breed
disease
and
impair
the
health
of
future
generation
.
the
menace
exists
not
only
in
the
slum
area
of
the
very
large
city
,
but
in
many
smaller
city
a
well
.
it
exists
on
ten
of
thousand
of
farm
,
in
varying
degree
,
in
every
part
of
the
country
.
another
example
is
the
prevalence
of
an
un-american
type
of
tenant
farming
.
i
do
not
suggest
that
every
farm
family
ha
the
capacity
to
earn
a
satisfactory
living
on
it
own
farm
.
but
many
thousand
of
tenant
farmer
,
indeed
most
of
them
,
with
some
financial
assistance
and
with
some
advice
and
training
,
can
be
made
self-supporting
on
land
which
can
eventually
belong
to
them
.
the
nation
would
be
wise
to
offer
them
that
chance
instead
of
permitting
them
to
go
along
a
they
do
now
,
year
after
year
,
with
neither
future
security
a
tenant
nor
hope
of
ownership
of
their
home
nor
expectation
of
bettering
the
lot
of
their
child
.
another
national
problem
is
the
intelligent
development
of
our
social
security
system
,
the
broadening
of
the
service
it
render
,
and
practical
improvement
in
it
operation
.
in
many
nation
where
such
law
are
in
effect
,
success
in
meeting
the
expectation
of
the
community
ha
come
through
frequent
amendment
of
the
original
statute
.
and
,
of
course
,
the
most
far-reaching
and
the
most
inclusive
problem
of
all
is
that
of
unemployment
and
the
lack
of
economic
balance
of
which
unemployment
is
at
once
the
result
and
the
symptom
.
the
immediate
question
of
adequate
relief
for
the
needy
unemployed
who
are
capable
of
performing
useful
work
,
i
shall
discus
with
the
congress
during
the
coming
month
.
the
broader
task
of
preventing
unemployment
is
a
matter
of
long-range
evolutionary
policy
.
to
that
we
must
continue
to
give
our
best
thought
and
effort
.
we
can
not
assume
that
immediate
industrial
and
commercial
activity
which
mitigates
present
pressure
justifies
the
national
government
at
this
time
in
placing
the
unemployment
problem
in
a
filing
cabinet
of
finished
business
.
fluctuation
in
employment
are
tied
to
all
other
wasteful
fluctuation
in
our
mechanism
of
production
and
distribution
.
one
of
these
waste
is
speculation
.
in
security
or
commodity
,
the
larger
the
volume
of
speculation
,
the
wider
become
the
upward
and
downward
swing
and
the
more
certain
the
result
that
in
the
long
run
there
will
be
more
loss
than
gain
in
the
underlying
wealth
of
the
community
.
and
,
a
is
now
well
known
to
all
of
u
,
the
same
net
loss
to
society
come
from
reckless
overproduction
and
monopolistic
underproduction
of
natural
and
manufactured
commodity
.
overproduction
,
underproduction
and
speculation
are
three
evil
sister
who
distill
the
trouble
of
unsound
inflation
and
disastrous
deflation
.
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
nation
to
have
government
help
private
enterprise
to
gain
sound
general
price
level
and
to
protect
those
level
from
wide
perilous
fluctuation
.
we
know
now
that
if
early
in
1931
government
had
taken
the
step
which
were
taken
two
and
three
year
later
,
the
depression
would
never
have
reached
the
depth
of
the
beginning
of
1933
.
sober
second
thought
confirms
most
of
u
in
the
belief
that
the
broad
objective
of
the
national
recovery
act
were
sound
.
we
know
now
that
it
difficulty
arose
from
the
fact
that
it
tried
to
do
too
much
.
for
example
,
it
wa
unwise
to
expect
the
same
agency
to
regulate
the
length
of
working
hour
,
minimum
wage
,
child
labor
and
collective
bargaining
on
the
one
hand
and
the
complicated
question
of
unfair
trade
practice
and
business
control
on
the
other
.
the
statute
of
n.r.a
.
ha
been
outlawed
.
the
problem
have
not
.
they
are
still
with
u
.
that
decent
condition
and
adequate
pay
for
labor
,
and
just
return
for
agriculture
,
can
be
secured
through
parallel
and
simultaneous
action
by
forty-eight
state
is
a
proven
impossibility
.
it
is
equally
impossible
to
obtain
curb
on
monopoly
,
unfair
trade
practice
and
speculation
by
state
action
alone
.
there
are
those
who
,
sincerely
or
insincerely
,
still
cling
to
state
action
a
a
theoretical
hope
.
but
experience
with
actuality
make
it
clear
that
federal
law
supplementing
state
law
are
needed
to
help
solve
the
problem
which
result
from
modern
invention
applied
in
an
industrialized
nation
which
conduct
it
business
with
scant
regard
to
state
line
.
during
the
past
year
there
ha
been
a
growing
belief
that
there
is
little
fault
to
be
found
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
a
it
stand
today
.
the
vital
need
is
not
an
alteration
of
our
fundamental
law
,
but
an
increasingly
enlightened
view
with
reference
to
it
.
difficulty
have
grown
out
of
it
interpretation
;
but
rightly
considered
,
it
can
be
used
a
an
instrument
of
progress
,
and
not
a
a
device
for
prevention
of
action
.
it
is
worth
our
while
to
read
and
reread
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
,
and
article
i
thereof
which
confers
the
legislative
power
upon
the
congress
of
the
united
state
.
it
is
also
worth
our
while
to
read
again
the
debate
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
year
ago
.
from
such
reading
,
i
obtain
the
very
definite
thought
that
the
member
of
that
convention
were
fully
aware
that
civilization
would
raise
problem
for
the
proposed
new
federal
government
,
which
they
themselves
could
not
even
surmise
;
and
that
it
wa
their
definite
intent
and
expectation
that
a
liberal
interpretation
in
the
year
to
come
would
give
to
the
congress
the
same
relative
power
over
new
national
problem
a
they
themselves
gave
to
the
congress
over
the
national
problem
of
their
day
.
in
presenting
to
the
convention
the
first
basic
draft
of
the
constitution
,
edmund
randolph
explained
that
it
wa
the
purpose
``
to
insert
essential
principle
only
,
lest
the
operation
of
government
should
be
clogged
by
rendering
those
provision
permanent
and
unalterable
which
ought
to
be
accommodated
to
time
and
event
.
''
with
a
better
understanding
of
our
purpose
,
and
a
more
intelligent
recognition
of
our
need
a
a
nation
,
it
is
not
to
be
assumed
that
there
will
be
prolonged
failure
to
bring
legislative
and
judicial
action
into
closer
harmony
.
mean
must
be
found
to
adapt
our
legal
form
and
our
judicial
interpretation
to
the
actual
present
national
need
of
the
largest
progressive
democracy
in
the
modern
world
.
that
thought
lead
to
a
consideration
of
world
problem
.
to
go
no
further
back
than
the
beginning
of
this
century
,
men
and
woman
everywhere
were
seeking
condition
of
life
very
different
from
those
which
were
customary
before
modern
invention
and
modern
industry
and
modern
communication
had
come
into
being
.
the
world
war
,
for
all
of
it
tragedy
,
encouraged
these
,
demand
,
and
stimulated
action
to
fulfill
these
new
desire
.
many
national
government
seemed
unable
adequately
to
respond
;
and
,
often
with
the
improvident
assent
of
the
mass
of
the
people
themselves
,
new
form
of
government
were
set
up
with
oligarchy
taking
the
place
of
democracy
.
in
oligarchy
,
militarism
ha
leapt
forward
,
while
in
those
nation
which
have
retained
democracy
,
militarism
ha
waned
.
i
have
recently
visited
three
of
our
sister
republic
in
south
america
.
the
very
cordial
reception
with
which
i
wa
greeted
were
in
tribute
to
democracy
.
to
me
the
outstanding
observation
of
that
visit
wa
that
the
mass
of
the
people
of
all
the
america
are
convinced
that
the
democratic
form
of
government
can
be
made
to
succeed
and
do
not
wish
to
substitute
for
it
any
other
form
of
government
.
they
believe
that
democracy
are
best
able
to
cope
with
the
changing
problem
of
modern
civilization
within
themselves
,
and
that
democracy
are
best
able
to
maintain
peace
among
themselves
.
the
inter-american
conference
,
operating
on
these
fundamental
principle
of
democracy
,
did
much
to
assure
peace
in
this
hemisphere

the

and
cultural
relationship
among

were
broadened
a
a
part
of
the
general
peace
program
.
in
a
world
unhappily
thinking
in
term
of
war
,
the
representative
of
twenty-one
nation
sat
around
a
table
,
in
an
atmosphere
of
complete
confidence
and
understanding
,
sincerely
discussing
measure
for
maintaining
peace
.
here
wa
a
great
and
a
permanent
achievement
directly
affecting
the
life
and
security
of
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
human
being
who
dwell
in
this
western
hemisphere
.
here
wa
an
example
which
must
have
a
wholesome
effect
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
.
in
a
very
real
sense
,
the
conference
in
buenos
aire
sent
forth
a
message
on
behalf
of
all
the
democracy
of
the
world
to
those
nation
which
live
otherwise
.
because
such
other
government
are
perhaps
more
spectacular
,
it
wa
high
time
for
democracy
to
assert
itself
.
because
all
of
u
believe
that
our
democratic
form
of
government
can
cope
adequately
with
modern
problem
a
they
arise
,
it
is
patriotic
a
well
a
logical
for
u
to
prove
that
we
can
meet
new
national
need
with
new
law
consistent
with
an
historic
constitutional
framework
clearly
intended
to
receive
liberal
and
not
narrow
interpretation
.
the
united
state
of
america
,
within
itself
,
must
continue
the
task
of
making
democracy
succeed
.
in
that
task
the
legislative
branch
of
our
government
will
,
i
am
confident
,
continue
to
meet
the
demand
of
democracy
whether
they
relate
to
the
curbing
of
abuse
,
the
extension
of
help
to
those
who
need
help
,
or
the
better
balancing
of
our
interdependent
economy
.
so
,
too
,
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
must
move
forward
in
this
task
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
provide
better
management
for
administrative
action
of
all
kind
.
the
judicial
branch
also
is
asked
by
the
people
to
do
it
part
in
making
democracy
successful
.
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
call
non-existent
power
into
being
,
but
we
have
a
right
to
expect
that
conceded
power
or
those
legitimately
implied
shall
be
made
effective
instrument
for
the
common
good
.
the
process
of
our
democracy
must
not
be
imperiled
by
the
denial
of
essential
power
of
free
government
.
your
task
and
mine
is
not
ending
with
the
end
of
the
depression
.
the
people
of
the
united
state
have
made
it
clear
that
they
expect
u
to
continue
our
active
effort
in
behalf
of
their
peaceful
advancement
.
in
that
spirit
of
endeavor
and
service
i
greet
the
75th
congress
at
the
beginning
of
this
auspicious
new
year
.
