my
fellow
citizen
:
the
four
year
which
have
elapsed
since
last
i
stood
in
this
place
havebeen
crowded
with
counsel
and
action
of
the
most
vital
interest
and
consequence.perhaps
no
equal
period
in
our
history
ha
been
so
fruitful
of
importantreforms
in
our
economic
and
industrial
life
or
so
full
of
significant
changesin
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
our
political
action
.
we
have
sought
verythoughtfully
to
set
our
house
in
order
,
correct
the
grosser
error
andabuses
of
our
industrial
life
,
liberate
and
quicken
the
process
of
ournational
genius
and
energy
,
and
lift
our
politics
to
a
broader
view
ofthe
people
's
essential
interest
.
it
is
a
record
of
singular
variety
and
singular
distinction
.
but
i
shallnot
attempt
to
review
it
.
it
speaks
for
itself
and
will
be
of
increasinginfluence
a
the
year
go
by
.
this
is
not
the
time
for
retrospect
.
it
istime
rather
to
speak
our
thought
and
purpose
concerning
the
present
andthe
immediate
future
.
although
we
have
centered
counsel
and
action
with
such
unusual
concentrationand
success
upon
the
great
problem
of
domestic
legislation
to
which
weaddressed
ourselves
four
year
ago
,
other
matter
have
more
and
more
forcedthemselves
upon
our
attention
--
matter
lying
outside
our
own
life
a
anation
and
over
which
we
had
no
control
,
but
which
,
despite
our
wish
tokeep
free
of
them
,
have
drawn
u
more
and
more
irresistibly
into
theirown
current
and
influence
.
it
ha
been
impossible
to
avoid
them
.
they
have
affected
the
life
ofthe
whole
world
.
they
have
shaken
men
everywhere
with
a
passion
and
anapprehension
they
never
knew
before
.
it
ha
been
hard
to
preserve
calmcounsel
while
the
thought
of
our
own
people
swayed
this
way
and
that
undertheir
influence
.
we
are
a
composite
and
cosmopolitan
people
.
we
are
ofthe
blood
of
all
the
nation
that
are
at
war
.
the
current
of
our
thoughtsas
well
a
the
current
of
our
trade
run
quick
at
all
season
back
andforth
between
u
and
them
.
the
war
inevitably
set
it
mark
from
the
firstalike
upon
our
mind
,
our
industry
,
our
commerce
,
our
politics
and
oursocial
action
.
to
be
indifferent
to
it
,
or
independent
of
it
,
wa
out
ofthe
question
.
and
yet
all
the
while
we
have
been
conscious
that
we
were
not
part
ofit
.
in
that
consciousness
,
despite
many
division
,
we
have
drawn
closertogether
.
we
have
been
deeply
wronged
upon
the
sea
,
but
we
have
not
wishedto
wrong
or
injure
in
return
;
have
retained
throughout
the
consciousnessof
standing
in
some
sort
apart
,
intent
upon
an
interest
that
transcendedthe
immediate
issue
of
the
war
itself
.
a
some
of
the
injury
done
u
have
become
intolerable
we
have
stillbeen
clear
that
we
wished
nothing
for
ourselves
that
we
were
not
readyto
demand
for
all
mankind
--
fair
dealing
,
justice
,
the
freedom
to
live
andto
be
at
ease
against
organized
wrong
.
it
is
in
this
spirit
and
with
this
thought
that
we
have
grown
more
andmore
aware
,
more
and
more
certain
that
the
part
we
wished
to
play
wa
thepart
of
those
who
mean
to
vindicate
and
fortify
peace
.
we
have
been
obligedto
arm
ourselves
to
make
good
our
claim
to
a
certain
minimum
of
right
andof
freedom
of
action
.
we
stand
firm
in
armed
neutrality
since
it
seemsthat
in
no
other
way
we
can
demonstrate
what
it
is
we
insist
upon
and
cannotforget
.
we
may
even
be
drawn
on
,
by
circumstance
,
not
by
our
own
purposeor
desire
,
to
a
more
active
assertion
of
our
right
a
we
see
them
anda
more
immediate
association
with
the
great
struggle
itself
.
but
nothingwill
alter
our
thought
or
our
purpose
.
they
are
too
clear
to
be
obscured.they
are
too
deeply
rooted
in
the
principle
of
our
national
life
to
bealtered
.
we
desire
neither
conquest
nor
advantage
.
we
wish
nothing
thatcan
be
had
only
at
the
cost
of
another
people
.
we
always
professed
unselfishpurpose
and
we
covet
the
opportunity
to
prove
our
profession
are
sincere
.
there
are
many
thing
still
to
be
done
at
home
,
to
clarify
our
own
politicsand
add
new
vitality
to
the
industrial
process
of
our
own
life
,
and
weshall
do
them
a
time
and
opportunity
serve
,
but
we
realize
that
the
greatestthings
that
remain
to
be
done
must
be
done
with
the
whole
world
for
stageand
in
cooperation
with
the
wide
and
universal
force
of
mankind
,
and
weare
making
our
spirit
ready
for
those
thing
.
we
are
provincial
no
longer
.
the
tragic
event
of
the
thirty
monthsof
vital
turmoil
through
which
we
have
just
passed
have
made
u
citizensof
the
world
.
there
can
be
no
turning
back
.
our
own
fortune
a
a
nationare
involved
whether
we
would
have
it
so
or
not
.
and
yet
we
are
not
the
le
american
on
that
account
.
we
shall
be
themore
american
if
we
but
remain
true
to
the
principle
in
which
we
havebeen
bred
.
they
are
not
the
principle
of
a
province
or
of
a
single
continent.we
have
known
and
boasted
all
along
that
they
were
the
principle
of
aliberated
mankind
.
these
,
therefore
,
are
the
thing
we
shall
stand
for
,
whether
in
war
or
in
peace
:
that
all
nation
are
equally
interested
in
the
peace
of
the
world
andin
the
political
stability
of
free
people
,
and
equally
responsible
fortheir
maintenance
;
that
the
essential
principle
of
peace
is
the
actualequality
of
nation
in
all
matter
of
right
or
privilege
;
that
peace
cannotsecurely
or
justly
rest
upon
an
armed
balance
of
power
;
that
governmentsderive
all
their
just
power
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
thatno
other
power
should
be
supported
by
the
common
thought
,
purpose
or
powerof
the
family
of
nation
;
that
the
sea
should
be
equally
free
and
safefor
the
use
of
all
people
,
under
rule
set
up
by
common
agreement
andconsent
,
and
that
,
so
far
a
practicable
,
they
should
be
accessible
toall
upon
equal
term
;
that
national
armament
shall
be
limited
to
the
necessitiesof
national
order
and
domestic
safety
;
that
the
community
of
interest
andof
power
upon
which
peace
must
henceforth
depend
imposes
upon
each
nationthe
duty
of
seeing
to
it
that
all
influence
proceeding
from
it
own
citizensmeant
to
encourage
or
assist
revolution
in
other
state
should
be
sternlyand
effectually
suppressed
and
prevented
.
i
need
not
argue
these
principle
to
you
,
my
fellow
countryman
;
theyare
your
own
part
and
parcel
of
your
own
thinking
and
your
own
motivesin
affair
.
they
spring
up
native
amongst
u
.
upon
this
a
a
platform
ofpurpose
and
of
action
we
can
stand
together
.
and
it
is
imperative
thatwe
should
stand
together
.
we
are
being
forged
into
a
new
unity
amidst
thefires
that
now
blaze
throughout
the
world
.
in
their
ardent
heat
we
shall
,
in
god
's
providence
,
let
u
hope
,
be
purged
of
faction
and
division
,
purifiedof
the
errant
humor
of
party
and
of
private
interest
,
and
shall
standforth
in
the
day
to
come
with
a
new
dignity
of
national
pride
and
spirit.let
each
man
see
to
it
that
the
dedication
is
in
his
own
heart
,
the
highpurpose
of
the
nation
in
his
own
mind
,
ruler
of
his
own
will
and
desire
.
i
stand
here
and
have
taken
the
high
and
solemn
oath
to
which
you
havebeen

because
the
people
of
the

neithercounsel
nor
action
will
avail
,
is
the
unity
of
america
--
an
america
unitedin
feeling
,
in
purpose
and
in
it
vision
of
duty
,
of
opportunity
and
ofservice
.
we
are
to
beware
of
all
men
who
would
turn
the
task
and
the
necessitiesof
the
nation
to
their
own
private
profit
or
use
them
for
the
buildingup
of
private
power

alike
in
the
conception
of
our
