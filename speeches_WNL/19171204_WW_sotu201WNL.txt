gentleman
of
the
congress
:
eight
month
have
elapsed
since
i
last
had
the
honor
of
addressing
you
.
they
have
been
month
crowded
with
event
of
immense
and
grave
significance
for
u
.
i
shall
not
undertake
to
retail
or
even
to
summarize
those
event
.
the
practical
particular
of
the
part
we
have
played
in
them
will
be
laid
before
you
in
the
report
of
the
executive
department
.
i
shall
discus
only
our
present
outlook
upon
these
vast
affair
,
our
present
duty
,
and
the
immediate
mean
of
accomplishing
the
object
we
shall
hold
always
in
view
.
i
shall
not
go
back
to
debate
the
cause
of
the
war
.
the
intolerable
wrong
done
and
planned
against
u
by
the
sinister
master
of
germany
have
long
since
become
too
grossly
obvious
and
odious
to
every
true
american
to
need
to
be
rehearsed
.
but
i
shall
ask
you
to
consider
again
and
with
a
very
grave
scrutiny
our
objective
and
the
measure
by
which
we
mean
to
attain
them
;
for
the
purpose
of
discussion
here
in
this
place
is
action
,
and
our
action
must
move
straight
towards
definite
end
.
our
object
is
,
of
course
,
to
win
the
war
;
and
we
shall
not
slacken
or
suffer
ourselves
to
be
diverted
until
it
is
won
.
but
it
is
worth
while
asking
and
answering
the
question
,
when
shall
we
consider
the
war
won
?
from
one
point
of
view
it
is
not
necessary
to
broach
this
fundamental
matter
.
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
american
people
know
what
the
war
is
about
and
what
sort
of
an
outcome
they
will
regard
a
a
realization
of
their
purpose
in
it
.
a
a
nation
we
are
united
in
spirit
and
intention
.
i
pay
little
heed
to
those
who
tell
me
otherwise
.
i
hear
the
voice
of
dissent
;
who
doe
not
?
i
hear
the
criticism
and
the
clamor
of
the
noisily
thoughtless
and
troublesome
.
i
also
see
men
here
and
there
fling
themselves
in
impotent
disloyalty
against
the
calm
,
indomitable
power
of
the
nation
.
i
hear
men
debate
peace
who
understand
neither
it
nature
not
the
way
in
which
we
may
attain
it
with
uplifted
eye
and
unbroken
spirit
.
but
i
know
that
none
of
these
speaks
for
the
nation
.
they
do
not
touch
the
heart
of
anything
.
they
may
safely
be
left
to
strut
their
uneasy
hour
and
be
forgotten
.
but
from
another
point
of
view
i
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
say
plainly
what
we
here
at
the
seat
of
action
consider
the
war
to
be
for
and
what
part
we
mean
to
play
in
the
settlement
of
it
searching
issue
.
we
are
the
spokesman
of
the
american
people
and
they
have
a
right
to
know
whether
their
purpose
is
ours
.
they
desire
peace
by
the
overcoming
of
evil
,
by
the
defeat
once
for
all
of
the
sinister
force
that
interrupt
peace
and
render
it
impossible
,
and
they
wish
to
know
how
closely
our
thought
run
with
theirs
and
what
action
we
propose
.
they
are
impatient
with
those
who
desire
peace
by
any
sort
of
compromise
--
deeply
and
indignantly
impatient
--
but
they
will
be
equally
impatient
with
u
if
we
do
not
make
it
plain
to
them
what
our
objective
are
and
what
we
are
planning
for
in
seeking
to
make
conquest
of
peace
by
arm
.
i
believe
that
i
speak
for
them
when
i
say
two
thing
:
first
,
that
this
intolerable
thing
of
which
the
master
of
germany
have
shown
u
the
ugly
face
,
this
menace
of
combined
intrigue
and
force
which
we
now
see
so
clearly
a
the
german
power
,
a
thing
without
conscience
or
honor
or
capacity
for
covenanted
peace
,
must
be
crushed
and
,
if
it
be
not
utterly
brought
to
an
end
,
at
least
shut
out
from
the
friendly
intercourse
of
the
nation
;
and
,
second
,
that
when
this
thing
and
it
power
are
indeed
defeated
and
the
time
come
that
we
can
discus
peace
--
when
the
german
people
have
spokesman
whose
word
we
can
believe
and
when
those
spokesman
are
ready
in
the
name
of
their
people
to
accept
the
common
judgment
of
the
nation
a
to
what
shall
henceforth
be
the
base
of
law
and
of
covenant
for
the
life
of
the
world
--
we
shall
be
willing
and
glad
to
pay
the
full
price
for
peace
,
and
pay
it
ungrudgingly
.
we
know
what
that
price
will
be
.
it
will
be
full
,
impartial
justice
--
justice
done
at
every
point
and
to
every
nation
that
the
final
settlement
must
affect
,
our
enemy
a
well
a
our
friend
.
you
catch
,
with
me
,
the
voice
of
humanity
that
are
in
the
air
.
they
grow
daily
more
audible
,
more
articulate
,
more
persuasive
,
and
they
come
from
the
heart
of
men
everywhere
.
they
insist
that
the
war
shall
not
end
in
vindictive
action
of
any
kind
;
that
no
nation
or
people
shall
be
robbed
or
punished
because
the
irresponsible
ruler
of
a
single
country
have
themselves
done
deep
and
abominable
wrong
.
it
is
this
thought
that
ha
been
expressed
in
the
formula
``
no
annexation
,
no
contribution
,
no
punitive
indemnity
.
''
just
because
this
crude
formula
express
the
instinctive
judgment
a
to
right
of
plain
men
everywhere
it
ha
been
made
diligent
use
of
by
the
master
of
german
intrigue
to
lead
the
people
of
russia
astray
,
and
the
people
of
every
other
country
their
agent
could
reach
,
in
order
that
a
premature
peace
might
be
brought
about
before
autocracy
ha
been
taught
it
final
and
convincing
lesson
,
and
the
people
of
the
world
put
in
control
of
their
own
destiny
.
but
the
fact
that
a
wrong
use
ha
been
made
of
a
just
idea
is
no
reason
why
a
right
use
should
not
be
made
of
it
.
it
ought
to
be
brought
under
the
patronage
of
it
real
friend
.
let
it
be
said
again
that
autocracy
must
first
be
shown
the
utter
futility
of
it
claim
to
power
or
leadership
in
the
modern
world
.
it
is
impossible
to
apply
any
standard
of
justice
so
long
a
such
force
are
unchecked
and
undefeated
a
the
present
master
of
germany
command
.
not
until
that
ha
been
done
can
right
be
set
up
a
arbiter
and
peace-maker
among
the
nation
.
but
when
that
ha
been
done
--
a
,
god
willing
,
it
assuredly
will
be
--
we
shall
at
last
be
free
to
do
an
unprecedented
thing
,
and
this
is
the
time
to
avow
our
purpose
to
do
it
.
we
shall
be
free
to
base
peace
on
generosity
and
justice
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
selfish
claim
to
advantage
even
on
the
part
of
the
victor
.
let
there
be
no
misunderstanding
.
our
present
and
immediate
task
is
to
win
the
war
,
and
nothing
shall
turn
u
aside
from
it
until
it
is
accomplished
.
every
power
and
resource
we
posse
,
whether
of
men
,
of
money
,
or
of
material
,
is
being
devoted
and
will
continue
to
be
devoted
to
that
purpose
until
it
is
achieved
.
those
who
desire
to
bring
peace
about
before
that
purpose
is
achieved
i
counsel
to
carry
their
advice
elsewhere
.
we
will
not
entertain
it
.
we
shall
regard
the
war
a
won
only
when
the
german
people
say
to
u
,
through
properly
accredited
representative
,
that
they
are
ready
to
agree
to
a
settlement
based
upon
justice
and
the
reparation
of
the
wrong
their
ruler
have
done
.
they
have
done
a
wrong
to
belgium
which
must
be
repaired
.
they
have
established
a
power
over
other
land
and
people
than
their
own
--
over
the
great
empire
of
austria-hungary
,
over
hitherto
free
balkan
state
,
over
turkey
,
and
within
asia
--
which
must
be
relinquished
.
germany
's
success
by
skill
,
by
industry
,
by
knowledge
,
by
enterprise
we
did
not
grudge
or
oppose
,
but
admired
,
rather
.
she
had
built
up
for
herself
a
real
empire
of
trade
and
influence
,
secured
by
the
peace
of
the
world
.
we
were
content
to
abide
the
rivalry
of
manufacture
,
science
,
and
commerce
that
were
involved
for
u
in
her
success
and
stand
or
fall
a
we
had
or
did
not
have
the
brain
and
the
initiative
to
surpass
her
.
but
at
the
moment
when
she
had
conspicuously
won
her
triumph
of
peace
she
threw
them
away
,
to
establish
in
their
stead
what
the
world
will
no
longer
permit
to
be
established
,
military
and
political
domination
by
arm
,
by
which
to
oust
where
she
could
not
excel
the
rival
she
most
feared
and
hated
.
the
peace
we
make
must
remedy
that
wrong
.
it
must
deliver
the
once
fair
land
and
happy
people
of
belgium
and
northern
france
from
the
prussian
conquest
and
the
prussian
menace
,
but
it
must
also
deliver
the
people
of
austria-hungary
,
the
people
of
the
balkan
,
and
the
people
of
turkey
,
alike
in
europe
and
in
asia
,
from
the
impudent
and
alien
dominion
of
the
prussian
military
and
commercial
autocracy
.
we
owe
it
,
however
,
to
ourselves
to
say
that
we
do
not
wish
in
any
way
to
impair
or
to
rearrange
the
austro-hungarian
empire
.
it
is
no
affair
of
ours
what
they
do
with
their
own
life
,
either
industrially
or
politically
.
we
do
not
purpose
or
desire
to
dictate
to
them
in
any
way
.
we
only
desire
to
see
that
their
affair
are
left
in
their
own
hand
,
in
all
matter
,
great
or
small
.
we
shall
hope
to
secure
for
the
people
of
the
balkan
peninsula
and
for
the
people
of
the
turkish
empire
the
right
and
opportunity
to
make
their
own
life
safe
,
their
own
fortune
secure
against
oppression
or
injustice
and
from
the
dictation
of
foreign
court
or
party
.
and
our
attitude
and
purpose
with
regard
to
germany
herself
are
of
a
like
kind
.
we
intend
no
wrong
against
the
german
empire
,
no
interference
with
her
internal
affair
.
we
should
deem
either
the
one
or
the
other
absolutely
unjustifiable
,
absolutely
contrary
to
the
principle
we
have
professed
to
live
by
and
to
hold
most
sacred
throughout
our
life
a
a
nation
.
the
people
of
germany
are
being
told
by
the
men
whom
they
now
permit
to
deceive
them
and
to
act
a
their
master
that
they
are
fighting
for
the
very
life
and
existence
of
their
empire
,
a
war
of
desperate
self-defense
against
deliberate
aggression
.
nothing
could
be
more
grossly
or
wantonly
false
,
and
we
must
seek
by
the
utmost
openness
and
candor
a
to
our
real
aim
to
convince
them
of
it
falseness
.
we
are
in
fact
fighting
for
their
emancipation
from
fear
,
along
with
our
own
--
from
the
fear
a
well
a
from
the
fact
of
unjust
attack
by
neighbor
or
rival
or
schemer
after
world
empire
.
no
one
is
threatening
the
existence
or
the
independence
or
the
peaceful
enterprise
of
the
german
empire
.
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
the
detriment
of
the
german
people
is
this
,
that
if
they
should
still
,
after
the
war
is
over
,
continue
to
be
obliged
to
live
under
ambitious
and
intriguing
master
interested
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
world
,
men
or
class
of
men
whom
the
other
people
of
the
world
could
not
trust
,
it
might
be
impossible
to
admit
them
to
the
partnership
of
nation
which
must
henceforth
guarantee
the
world
's
peace
.
that
partnership
must
be
a
partnership
of
people
,
not
a
mere
partnership
of
government
.
it
might
be
impossible
,
also
,
in
such
untoward
circumstance
,
to
admit
germany
to
the
free
economic
intercourse
which
must
inevitably
spring
out
of
the
other
partnership
of
a
real
peace
.
but
there
would
be
no
aggression
in
that
;
and
such
a
situation
,
inevitable
because
of
distrust
,
would
in
the
very
nature
of
thing
sooner
or
later
cure
itself
,
by
process
which
would
assuredly
set
in
.
the
wrong
,
the
very
deep
wrong
,
committed
in
this
war
will
have
to
be
righted
.
that
of
course
.
but
they
can
not
and
must
not
be
righted
by
the
commission
of
similar
wrong
against
germany
and
her
ally
.
the
world
will
not
permit
the
commission
of
similar
wrong
a
a
mean
of
reparation
and
settlement
.
statesman
must
by
this
time
have
learned
that
the
opinion
of
the
world
is
everywhere
wide
awake
and
fully
comprehends
the
issue
involved
.
no
representative
of
any
self-governed
nation
will
dare
disregard
it
by
attempting
any
such
covenant
of
selfishness
and
compromise
a
were
entered
into
at
the
congress
of
vienna
.
the
thought
of
the
plain
people
here
and
everywhere
throughout
the
world
,
the
people
who
enjoy
no
privilege
and
have
very
simple
and
unsophisticated
standard
of
right
and
wrong
,
is
the
air
all
government
must
henceforth
breathe
if
they
would
live
.
it
is
in
the
full
disclosing
light
of
that
thought
that
all
policy
must
be
conceived
and
executed
in
this
midday
hour
of
the
world
's
life
.
german
ruler
have
been
able
to
upset
the
peace
of
the
world
only
because
the
german
people
were
not
suffered
under
their
tutelage
to
share
the
comradeship
of
the
other
people
of
the
world
either
in
thought
or
in
purpose
.
they
were
allowed
to
have
no
opinion
of
their
own
which
might
be
set
up
a
a
rule
of
conduct
for
those
who
exercised
authority
over
them
.
but
the
congress
that
concludes
this
war
will
feel
the
full
strength
of
the
tide
that
run
now
in
the
heart
and
conscience
of
free
men
everywhere
.
it
conclusion
will
run
with
those
tide
.
all
these
thing
have
been
true
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
stupendous
war
;
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
they
had
been
made
plain
at
the
very
outset
the
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
of
the
russian
people
might
have
been
once
for
all
enlisted
on
the
side
of
the
ally
,
suspicion
and
distrust
swept
away
,
and
a
real
and
lasting
union
of
purpose
effected
.
had
they
believed
these
thing
at
the
very
moment
of
their
revolution
and
had
they
been
confirmed
in
that
belief
since
,
the
sad
revers
which
have
recently
marked
the
progress
of
their
affair
towards
an
ordered
and
stable
government
of
free
men
might
have
been
avoided
.
the
russian
people
have
been
poisoned
by
the
very
same
falsehood
that
have
kept
the
german
people
in
the
dark
,
and
the
poison
ha
been
administered
by
the
very
same
hand
.
the
only
possible
antidote
is
the
truth
.
it
can
not
be
uttered
too
plainly
or
too
often
.
from
every
point
of
view
,
therefore
,
it
ha
seemed
to
be
my
duty
to
speak
these
declaration
of
purpose
,
to
add
these
specific
interpretation
to
what
i
took
the
liberty
of
saying
to
the
senate
in
january
.
our
entrance
into
the
war
ha
not
altered
our
attitude
towards
the
settlement
that
must
come
when
it
is
over
.
when
i
said
in
january
that
the
nation
of
the
world
were
entitled
not
only
to
free
pathway
upon
the
sea
but
also
to
assured
and
unmolested
access
to
those
pathway
i
wa
thinking
,
and
i
am
thinking
now
,
not
of
the
smaller
and
weaker
nation
alone
,
which
need
our
countenance
and
support
,
but
also
of
the
great
and
powerful
nation
,
and
of
our
present
enemy
a
well
a
our
present
associate
in
the
war
.
i
wa
thinking
,
and
am
thinking
now
,
of
austria
herself
,
among
the
rest
,
a
well
a
of
serbia
and
of
poland
.
justice
and
equality
of
right
can
be
had
only
at
a
great
price
.
we
are
seeking
permanent
,
not
temporary
,
foundation
for
the
peace
of
the
world
and
must
seek
them
candidly
and
fearlessly
.
a
always
,
the
right
will
prove
to
be
the
expedient
.
what
shall
we
do
,
then
,
to
push
this
great
war
of
freedom
and
justice
to
it
righteous
conclusion
?
we
must
clear
away
with
a
thorough
hand
all
impediment
to
success
and
we
must
make
every
adjustment
of
law
that
will
facilitate
the
full
and
free
use
of
our
whole
capacity
and
force
a
a
fighting
unit
.
one
very
embarrassing
obstacle
that
stand
in
our
way
is
that
we
are
at
war
with
germany
but
not
with
her
ally
.
i
therefore
very
earnestly
recommend
that
the
congress
immediately
declare
the
united
state
in
a
state
of
war
with
austria-hungary
.
doe
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
this
should
be
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
i
have
just
addressed
to
you
?
it
is
not
.
it
is
in
fact
the
inevitable
logic
of
what
i
have
said
.
austria-hungary
is
for
the
time
being
not
her
own
mistress
but
simply
the
vassal
of
the
german
government
.
we
must
face
the
fact
a
they
are
and
act
upon
them
without
sentiment
in
this
stern
business
.
the
government
of
austria-hungary
is
not
acting
upon
it
own
initiative
or
in
response
to
the
wish
and
feeling
of
it
own
people
but
a
the
instrument
of
another
nation
.
we
must
meet
it
force
with
our
own
and
regard
the
central
power
a
but
one
.
the
war
can
be
successfully
conducted
in
no
other
way
.
the
same
logic
would
lead
also
to
a
declaration
of
war
against
turkey
and
bulgaria
.
they
also
are
the
tool
of
germany
.
but
they
are
mere
tool
and
do
not
yet
stand
in
the
direct
path
of
our
necessary
action
.
we
shall
go
wherever
the
necessity
of
this
war
carry
u
,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
go
only
where
immediate
and
practical
consideration
lead
u
and
not
heed
any
others
.
the
financial
and
military
measure
which
must
be
adopted
will
suggest
themselves
a
the
war
and
it
undertaking
develop
,
but
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
proposing
to
you
certain
other
act
of
legislation
which
seem
to
me
to
be
needed
for
the
support
of
the
war
and
for
the
release
of
our
whole
force
and
energy
.
it
will
be
necessary
to
extend
in
certain
particular
the
legislation
of
the
last
session
with
regard
to
alien
enemy
;
and
also
necessary
,
i
believe
,
to
create
a
very
definite
and
particular
control
over
the
entrance
and
departure
of
all
person
into
and
from
the
united
state
.
legislation
should
be
enacted
defining
a
a
criminal
offense
every
willful
violation
of
the
presidential
proclamation
relating
to
alien
enemy
promulgated
under
section
4067
of
the
revised
statute
and
providing
appropriate
punishment
;
and
woman
a
well
a
men
should
be
included
under
the
term
of
the
act
placing
restraint
upon
alien
enemy
.
it
is
likely
that
a
time
go
on
many
alien
enemy
will
be
willing
to
be
fed
and
housed
at
the
expense
of
the
government
in
the
detention
camp
and
it
would
be
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
i
have
suggested
to
confine
offender
among
them
in
penitentiary
and
other
similar
institution
where
they
could
be
made
to
work
a
other
criminal
do
.
recent
experience
ha
convinced
me
that
the
congress
must
go
further
in
authorizing
the
government
to
set
limit
to
price
.
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
,
i
am
sorry
to
say
,
ha
been
replaced
by
the
law
of
unrestrained
selfishness
.
while
we
have
eliminated
profiteering
in
several
branch
of
industry
it
still
run
impudently
rampant
in
others
.
the
farmer
,
for
example
,
complain
with
a
great
deal
of
justice
that
,
while
the
regulation
of
food
price
restricts
their
income
,
no
restraint
are
placed
upon
the
price
of
most
of
the
thing
they
must
themselves
purchase
;
and
similar
inequity
obtain
on
all
side
.
it
is
imperatively
necessary
that
the
consideration
of
the
full
use
of
the
water
power
of
the
country
and
also
the
consideration
of
the
systematic
and
yet
economical
development
of
such
of
the
natural
resource
of
the
country
a
are
still
under
the
control
of
the
federal
government
should
be
immediately
resumed
and
affirmatively
and
constructively
dealt
with
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
.
the
pressing
need
of
such
legislation
is
daily
becoming
more
obvious
.
the
legislation
proposed
at
the
last
session
with
regard
to
regulated
combination
among
our
exporter
,
in
order
to
provide
for
our
foreign
trade
a
more
effective
organization
and
method
of
cooperation
,
ought
by
all
mean
to
be
completed
at
this
session
.
and
i
beg
that
the
member
of
the
house
of
representative
will
permit
me
to
express
the
opinion
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
deal
in
any
but
a
very
wasteful
and
extravagant
fashion
with
the
enormous
appropriation
of
the
public
money
which
must
continue
to
be
made
,
if
the
war
is
to
be
properly
sustained
,
unless
the
house
will
consent
to
return
to
it
former
practice
of
initiating
and
preparing
all
appropriation
bill
through
a
single
committee
,
in
order
that
responsibility
may
be
centered
,
expenditure
standardized
and
made
uniform
,
and
waste
and
duplication
a
much
a
possible
avoided
.
additional
legislation
may
also
become
necessary
before
the
present
congress
again
adjourns
in
order
to
effect
the
most
efficient
coordination
and
operation
of
the
railway
and
other
transportation
system
of
the
country
;
but
to
that
i
shall
,
if
circumstance
should
demand
,
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
upon
another
occasion
.
if
i
have
overlooked
anything
that
ought
to
be
done
for
the
more
effective
conduct
of
the
war
,
your
own
counsel
will
supply
the
omission
.
what
i
am
perfectly
clear
about
is
that
in
the
present
session
of
the
congress
our
whole
attention
and
energy
should
be
concentrated
on
the
vigorous
,
rapid
,
and
successful
prosecution
of
the
great
task
of
winning
the
war
.
we
can
do
this
with
all
the
greater
zeal
and
enthusiasm
because
we
know
that
for
u
this
is
a
war
of
high
principle
,
debased
by
no
selfish
ambition
of
conquest
or
spoliation
;
because
we
know
,
and
all
the
world
know
,
that
we
have
been
forced
into
it
to
save
the
very
institution
we
live
under
from
corruption
and
destruction
.
the
purpose
of
the
central
power
strike
straight
at
the
very
heart
of
everything
we
believe
in
;
their
method
of
warfare
outrage
every
principle
of
humanity
and
of
knightly
honor
;
their
intrigue
ha
corrupted
the
very
thought
and
spirit
of
many
of
our
people
;
their
sinister
and
secret
diplomacy
ha
sought
to
take
our
very
territory
away
from
u
and
disrupt
the
union
of
the
state
.
our
safety
would
be
at
an
end
,
our
honor
forever
sullied
and
brought
into
contempt
were
we
to
permit
their
triumph
.
they
are
striking
at
the
very
existence
of
democracy
and
liberty
.
it
is
because
it
is
for
u
a
war
of
high
,
disinterested
purpose
,
in
which
all
the
free
people
of
the
world
are
banded
together
for
the
vindication
of
right
,
a
war
for
the
preservation
of
our
nation
and
of
all
that
it
ha
held
dear
of
principle
and
of
purpose
,
that
we
feel
ourselves
doubly
constrained
to
propose
for
it
outcome
only
that
which
is
righteous
and
of
irreproachable
intention
,
for
our
foe
a
well
a
for
our
friend
.
the
cause
being
just
and
holy
,
the
settlement
must
be
of
like
motive
and
quality
.
for
this
we
can
fight
,
but
for
nothing
le
noble
or
le
worthy
of
our
tradition
.
for
this
cause
we
entered
the
war
and
for
this
cause
will
we
battle
until
the
last
gun
is
fired
.
i
have
spoken
plainly
because
this
seems
to
me
the
time
when
it
is
most
necessary
to
speak
plainly
,
in
order
that
all
the
world
may
know
that
even
in
the
heat
and
ardor
of
the
struggle
and
when
our
whole
thought
is
of
carrying
the
war
through
to
it
end
we
have
not
forgotten
any
ideal
or
principle
for
which
the
name
of
america
ha
been
held
in
honor
among
the
nation
and
for
which
it
ha
been
our
glory
to
contend
in
the
great
generation
that
went
before
u
.
a
supreme
moment
of
history
ha
come
.
the
eye
of
the
people
have
been
opened
and
they
see
.
the
hand
of
god
is
laid
upon
the
nation
.
he
will
show
them
favor
,
i
devoutly
believe
,
only
if
they
rise
to
the
clear
height
of
his
own
justice
and
mercy
.
