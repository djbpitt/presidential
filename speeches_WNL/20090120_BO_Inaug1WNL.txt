i
stand
here
today
humbled
by
the
task
before
u
,
grateful
for
the
trust
you
have
bestowed
,
mindful
of
the
sacrifice
borne
by
our
ancestor
.
i
thank
president
bush
for
his
service
to
our
nation
,
a
well
a
the
generosity
and
cooperation
he
ha
shown
throughout
this
transition
.
forty-four
american
have
now
taken
the
presidential
oath
.
the
word
have
been
spoken
during
rising
tide
of
prosperity
and
the
still
water
of
peace
.
yet
,
every
so
often
the
oath
is
taken
amidst
gathering
cloud
and
raging
storm
.
at
these
moment
,
america
ha
carried
on
not
simply
because
of
the
skill
or
vision
of
those
in
high
office
,
but
because
we
the
people
have
remained
faithful
to
the
ideal
of
our
forbearers
,
and
true
to
our
founding
document
.
so
it
ha
been
.
so
it
must
be
with
this
generation
of
american
.
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
crisis
is
now
well
understood
.
our
nation
is
at
war
,
against
a
far-reaching
network
of
violence
and
hatred
.
our
economy
is
badly
weakened
,
a
consequence
of
greed
and
irresponsibility
on
the
part
of
some
,
but
also
our
collective
failure
to
make
hard
choice
and
prepare
the
nation
for
a
new
age
.
home
have
been
lost
;
job
shed
;
business
shuttered
.
our
health
care
is
too
costly
;
our
school
fail
too
many
;
and
each
day
brings
further
evidence
that
the
way
we
use
energy
strengthen
our
adversary
and
threaten
our
planet
.
these
are
the
indicator
of
crisis
,
subject
to
data
and
statistic
.
le
measurable
but
no
le
profound
is
a
sapping
of
confidence
across
our
land—a
nagging
fear
that
america
's
decline
is
inevitable
,
and
that
the
next
generation
must
lower
it
sight
.
today
i
say
to
you
that
the
challenge
we
face
are
real
.
they
are
serious
and
they
are
many
.
they
will
not
be
met
easily
or
in
a
short
span
of
time
.
but
know
this
,
america—they
will
be
met
.
on
this
day
,
we
gather
because
we
have
chosen
hope
over
fear
,
unity
of
purpose
over
conflict
and
discord
.
on
this
day
,
we
come
to
proclaim
an
end
to
the
petty
grievance
and
false
promise
,
the
recrimination
and
worn
out
dogma
,
that
for
far
too
long
have
strangled
our
politics
.
we
remain
a
young
nation
,
but
in
the
word
of
scripture
,
the
time
ha
come
to
set
aside
childish
thing
.
the
time
ha
come
to
reaffirm
our
enduring
spirit
;
to
choose
our
better
history
;
to
carry
forward
that
precious
gift
,
that
noble
idea
,
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation
:
the
god-given
promise
that
all
are
equal
,
all
are
free
,
and
all
deserve
a
chance
to
pursue
their
full
measure
of
happiness
.
in
reaffirming
the
greatness
of
our
nation
,
we
understand
that
greatness
is
never
a
given
.
it
must
be
earned
.
our
journey
ha
never
been
one
of
short-cuts
or
settling
for
le
.
it
ha
not
been
the
path
for
the
faint-hearted—for
those
who
prefer
leisure
over
work
,
or
seek
only
the
pleasure
of
rich
and
fame
.
rather
,
it
ha
been
the
risk-takers
,
the
doer
,
the
maker
of
things—some
celebrated
but
more
often
men
and
woman
obscure
in
their
labor
,
who
have
carried
u
up
the
long
,
rugged
path
towards
prosperity
and
freedom
.
for
u
,
they
packed
up
their
few
worldly
possession
and
traveled
across
ocean
in
search
of
a
new
life
.
for
u
,
they
toiled
in
sweatshop
and
settled
the
west
;
endured
the
lash
of
the
whip
and
plowed
the
hard
earth
.
for
u
,
they
fought
and
died
,
in
place
like
concord
and
gettysburg
;
normandy
and
khe
sahn
.
time
and
again
these
men
and
woman
struggled
and
sacrificed
and
worked
till
their
hand
were
raw
so
that
we
might
live
a
better
life
.
they
saw
america
a
bigger
than
the
sum
of
our
individual
ambition
;
greater
than
all
the
difference
of
birth
or
wealth
or
faction
.
this
is
the
journey
we
continue
today
.
we
remain
the
most
prosperous
,
powerful
nation
on
earth
.
our
worker
are
no
le
productive
than
when
this
crisis
began
.
our
mind
are
no
le
inventive
,
our
good
and
service
no
le
needed
than
they
were
last
week
or
last
month
or
last
year
.
our
capacity
remains
undiminished
.
but
our
time
of
standing
pat
,
of
protecting
narrow
interest
and
putting
off
unpleasant
decisions—that
time
ha
surely
passed
.
starting
today
,
we
must
pick
ourselves
up
,
dust
ourselves
off
,
and
begin
again
the
work
of
remaking
america
.
for
everywhere
we
look
,
there
is
work
to
be
done
.
the
state
of
the
economy
call
for
action
,
bold
and
swift
,
and
we
will
act—not
only
to
create
new
job
,
but
to
lay
a
new
foundation
for
growth
.
we
will
build
the
road
and
bridge
,
the
electric
grid
and
digital
line
that
feed
our
commerce
and
bind
u
together
.
we
will
restore
science
to
it
rightful
place
,
and
wield
technology
's
wonder
to
raise
health
care
's
quality
and
lower
it
cost
.
we
will
harness
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
the
soil
to
fuel
our
car
and
run
our
factory
.
and
we
will
transform
our
school
and
college
and
university
to
meet
the
demand
of
a
new
age
.
all
this
we
can
do
.
and
all
this
we
will
do
.
now
,
there
are
some
who
question
the
scale
of
our
ambitions—who
suggest
that
our
system
can
not
tolerate
too
many
big
plan
.
their
memory
are
short
.
for
they
have
forgotten
what
this
country
ha
already
done
;
what
free
men
and
woman
can
achieve
when
imagination
is
joined
to
common
purpose
,
and
necessity
to
courage
.
what
the
cynic
fail
to
understand
is
that
the
ground
ha
shifted
beneath
them—that
the
stale
political
argument
that
have
consumed
u
for
so
long
no
longer
apply
.
the
question
we
ask
today
is
not
whether
our
government
is
too
big
or
too
small
,
but
whether
it
works—whether
it
help
family
find
job
at
a
decent
wage
,
care
they
can
afford
,
a
retirement
that
is
dignified
.
where
the
answer
is
yes
,
we
intend
to
move
forward
.
where
the
answer
is
no
,
program
will
end
.
and
those
of
u
who
manage
the
public
's
dollar
will
be
held
to
account—to
spend
wisely
,
reform
bad
habit
,
and
do
our
business
in
the
light
of
day—because
only
then
can
we
restore
the
vital
trust
between
a
people
and
their
government
.
nor
is
the
question
before
u
whether
the
market
is
a
force
for
good
or
ill.
it
power
to
generate
wealth
and
expand
freedom
is
unmatched
,
but
this
crisis
ha
reminded
u
that
without
a
watchful
eye
,
the
market
can
spin
out
of
control—and
that
a
nation
can
not
prosper
long
when
it
favor
only
the
prosperous
.
the
success
of
our
economy
ha
always
depended
not
just
on
the
size
of
our
gross
domestic
product
,
but
on
the
reach
of
our
prosperity
;
on
our
ability
to
extend
opportunity
to
every
willing
heart—not
out
of
charity
,
but
because
it
is
the
surest
route
to
our
common
good
.
a
for
our
common
defense
,
we
reject
a
false
the
choice
between
our
safety
and
our
ideal
.
our
founding
father
,
faced
with
peril
we
can
scarcely
imagine
,
drafted
a
charter
to
assure
the
rule
of
law
and
the
right
of
man
,
a
charter
expanded
by
the
blood
of
generation
.
those
ideal
still
light
the
world
,
and
we
will
not
give
them
up
for
expedience
's
sake
.
and
so
to
all
other
people
and
government
who
are
watching
today
,
from
the
grandest
capital
to
the
small
village
where
my
father
wa
born
:
know
that
america
is
a
friend
of
each
nation
and
every
man
,
woman
,
and
child
who
seek
a
future
of
peace
and
dignity
,
and
that
we
are
ready
to
lead
once
more
.
recall
that
earlier
generation
faced
down
fascism
and
communism
not
just
with
missile
and
tank
,
but
with
sturdy
alliance
and
enduring
conviction
.
they
understood
that
our
power
alone
can
not
protect
u
,
nor
doe
it
entitle
u
to
do
a
we
please
.
instead
,
they
knew
that
our
power
grows
through
it
prudent
use
;
our
security
emanates
from
the
justness
of
our
cause
,
the
force
of
our
example
,
the
tempering
quality
of
humility
and
restraint
.
we
are
the
keeper
of
this
legacy
.
guided
by
these
principle
once
more
,
we
can
meet
those
new
threat
that
demand
even
greater
effort—even
greater
cooperation
and
understanding
between
nation
.
we
will
begin
to
responsibly
leave
iraq
to
it
people
,
and
forge
a
hard-earned
peace
in
afghanistan
.
with
old
friend
and
former
foe
,
we
will
work
tirelessly
to
lessen
the
nuclear
threat
,
and
roll
back
the
specter
of
a
warming
planet
.
we
will
not
apologize
for
our
way
of
life
,
nor
will
we
waver
in
it
defense
,
and
for
those
who
seek
to
advance
their
aim
by
inducing
terror
and
slaughtering
innocent
,
we
say
to
you
now
that
our
spirit
is
stronger
and
can
not
be
broken
;
you
can
not
outlast
u
,
and
we
will
defeat
you
.
for
we
know
that
our
patchwork
heritage
is
a
strength
,
not
a
weakness
.
we
are
a
nation
of
christian
and
muslim
,
jew
and
hindu
and
non-believers
.
we
are
shaped
by
every
language
and
culture
,
drawn
from
every
end
of
this
earth
;
and
because
we
have
tasted
the
bitter
swill
of
civil
war
and
segregation
,
and
emerged
from
that
dark
chapter
stronger
and
more
united
,
we
can
not
help
but
believe
that
the
old
hatred
shall
someday
pas
;
that
the
line
of
tribe
shall
soon
dissolve
;
that
a
the
world
grows
smaller
,
our
common
humanity
shall
reveal
itself
;
and
that
america
must
play
it
role
in
ushering
in
a
new
era
of
peace
.
to
the
muslim
world
,
we
seek
a
new
way
forward
,
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
.
to
those
leader
around
the
globe
who
seek
to
sow
conflict
,
or
blame
their
society
's
ill
on
the
west
,
know
that
your
people
will
judge
you
on
what
you
can
build
,
not
what
you
destroy
.
to
those
who
cling
to
power
through
corruption
and
deceit
and
the
silencing
of
dissent
,
know
that
you
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
;
but
that
we
will
extend
a
hand
if
you
are
willing
to
unclench
your
fist
.
to
the
people
of
poor
nation
,
we
pledge
to
work
alongside
you
to
make
your
farm
flourish
and
let
clean
water
flow
;
to
nourish
starved
body
and
feed
hungry
mind
.
and
to
those
nation
like
ours
that
enjoy
relative
plenty
,
we
say
we
can
no
longer
afford
indifference
to
suffering
outside
our
border
;
nor
can
we
consume
the
world
's
resource
without
regard
to
effect
.
for
the
world
ha
changed
,
and
we
must
change
with
it
.
a
we
consider
the
road
that
unfolds
before
u
,
we
remember
with
humble
gratitude
those
brave
american
who
,
at
this
very
hour
,
patrol
far-off
desert
and
distant
mountain
.
they
have
something
to
tell
u
today
,
just
a
the
fallen
hero
who
lie
in
arlington
whisper
through
the
age
.
we
honor
them
not
only
because
they
are
guardian
of
our
liberty
,
but
because
they
embody
the
spirit
of
service
;
a
willingness
to
find
meaning
in
something
greater
than
themselves
.
and
yet
,
at
this
moment—a
moment
that
will
define
a
generation—it
is
precisely
this
spirit
that
must
inhabit
u
all
.
for
a
much
a
government
can
do
and
must
do
,
it
is
ultimately
the
faith
and
determination
of
the
american
people
upon
which
this
nation
relies
.
it
is
the
kindness
to
take
in
a
stranger
when
the
levee
break
,
the
selflessness
of
worker
who
would
rather
cut
their
hour
than
see
a
friend
lose
their
job
which
see
u
through
our
darkest
hour
.
it
is
the
firefighter
's
courage
to
storm
a
stairway
filled
with
smoke
,
but
also
a
parent
's
willingness
to
nurture
a
child
,
that
finally
decides
our
fate
.
our
challenge
may
be
new
.
the
instrument
with
which
we
meet
them
may
be
new
.
but
those
value
upon
which
our
success
depends—hard
work
and
honesty
,
courage
and
fair
play
,
tolerance
and
curiosity
,
loyalty
and
patriotism—these
thing
are
old
.
these
thing
are
true
.
they
have
been
the
quiet
force
of
progress
throughout
our
history
.
what
is
demanded
then
is
a
return
to
these
truth
.
what
is
required
of
u
now
is
a
new
era
of
responsibility—a
recognition
,
on
the
part
of
every
american
,
that
we
have
duty
to
ourselves
,
our
nation
,
and
the
world
,
duty
that
we
do
not
grudgingly
accept
but
rather
seize
gladly
,
firm
in
the
knowledge
that
there
is
nothing
so
satisfying
to
the
spirit
,
so
defining
of
our
character
,
than
giving
our
all
to
a
difficult
task
.
this
is
the
price
and
the
promise
of
citizenship
.
this
is
the
source
of
our
confidence—the
knowledge
that
god
call
on
u
to
shape
an
uncertain
destiny
.
this
is
the
meaning
of
our
liberty
and
our
creed—why
men
and
woman
and
child
of
every
race
and
every
faith
can
join
in
celebration
across
this
magnificent
mall
,
and
why
a
man
whose
father
le
than
sixty
year
ago
might
not
have
been
served
at
a
local
restaurant
can
now
stand
before
you
to
take
a
most
sacred
oath
.
so
let
u
mark
this
day
with
remembrance
,
of
who
we
are
and
how
far
we
have
traveled
.
in
the
year
of
america
's
birth
,
in
the
coldest
of
month
,
a
small
band
of
patriot
huddled
by
dying
campfire
on
the
shore
of
an
icy
river
.
the
capital
wa
abandoned
.
the
enemy
wa
advancing
.
the
snow
wa
stained
with
blood
.
at
a
moment
when
the
outcome
of
our
revolution
wa
most
in
doubt
,
the
father
of
our
nation
ordered
these
word
be
read
to
the
people
:
``
let
it
be
told
to
the
future
world
...
that
in
the
depth
of
winter
,
when
nothing
but
hope
and
virtue
could
survive
...
that
the
city
and
the
country
,
alarmed
at
one
common
danger
,
came
forth
to
meet
[
it
]
.
''
america
.
in
the
face
of
our
common
danger
,
in
this
winter
of
our
hardship
,
let
u
remember
these
timeless
word
.
with
hope
and
virtue
,
let
u
brave
once
more
the
icy
current
,
and
endure
what
storm
may
come
.
let
it
be
said
by
our
child
's
child
that
when
we
were
tested
we
refused
to
let
this
journey
end
,
that
we
did
not
turn
back
nor
did
we
falter
;
and
with
eye
fixed
on
the
horizon
and
god
's
grace
upon
u
,
we
carried
forth
that
great
gift
of
freedom
and
delivered
it
safely
to
future
generation
.
thank
you
.
god
bless
you
.
and
may
god
bless
the
united
state
of
america
.
