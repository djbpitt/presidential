fellow-citizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representative
:
in
meeting
you
at
the
present
interesting
conjuncture
it
would
have
been
highly
satisfactory
if
i
could
have
communicated
a
favorable
result
to
the
mission
charged
with
negotiation
for
restoring
peace
.
it
wa
a
just
expectation
,
from
the
respect
due
to
the
distinguished
sovereign
who
had
invited
them
by
his
offer
of
mediation
,
from
the
readiness
with
which
the
invitation
wa
accepted
on
the
part
of
the
united
state
,
and
from
the
pledge
to
be
found
in
an
act
of
their
legislature
for
the
liberality
which
their
plenipotentiary
would
carry
into
the
negotiation
,
that
no
time
would
be
lost
by
the
british
government
in
embracing
the
experiment
for
hastening
a
stop
to
the
effusion
of
blood
.
a
prompt
and
cordial
acceptance
of
the
mediation
on
that
side
wa
the
le
to
be
doubted
,
a
it
wa
of
a
nature
not
to
submit
right
or
pretension
on
either
side
to
the
decision
of
an
umpire
,
but
to
afford
merely
an
opportunity
,
honorable
and
desirable
to
both
,
for
discussing
and
,
if
possible
,
adjusting
them
for
the
interest
of
both
.
the
british
cabinet
,
either
mistaking
our
desire
of
peace
for
a
dread
of
british
power
or
misled
by
other
fallacious
calculation
,
ha
disappointed
this
reasonable
anticipation
.
no
communication
from
our
envoy
having
reached
u
,
no
information
on
the
subject
ha
been
received
from
that
source
;
but
it
is
known
that
the
mediation
wa
declined
in
the
1st
instance
,
and
there
is
no
evidence
,
notwithstanding
the
lapse
of
time
,
that
a
change
of
disposition
in
the
british
council
ha
taken
place
or
is
to
be
expected
.
under
such
circumstance
a
nation
proud
of
it
right
and
conscious
of
it
strength
ha
no
choice
but
an
exertion
of
the
1
in
support
of
the
other
.
to
this
determination
the
best
encouragement
is
derived
from
the
success
with
which
it
ha
pleased
the
almighty
to
bless
our
arm
both
on
the
land
and
on
the
water
.
whilst
proof
have
been
continued
of
the
enterprise
and
skill
of
our
cruiser
,
public
and
private
,
on
the
ocean
,
and
a
trophy
gained
in
the
capture
of
a
british
by
an
american
vessel
of
war
,
after
an
action
giving
celebrity
to
the
name
of
the
victorious
commander
,
the
great
inland
water
on
which
the
enemy
were
also
to
be
encountered
have
presented
achievement
of
our
naval
arm
a
brilliant
in
their
character
a
they
have
been
important
in
their
consequence
.
on
lake
erie
,
the
squadron
under
command
of
captain
perry
having
met
the
british
squadron
of
superior
force
,
a
sanguinary
conflict
ended
in
the
capture
of
the
whole
.
the
conduct
of
that
officer
,
adroit
a
it
wa
daring
,
and
which
wa
so
well
seconded
by
his
comrade
,
justly
entitles
them
to
the
admiration
and
gratitude
of
their
country
,
and
will
fill
an
early
page
in
it
naval
annals
with
a
victory
never
surpassed
in
luster
,
however
much
it
may
have
been
in
magnitude
.
on
lake
ontario
the
caution
of
the
british
commander
,
favored
by
contingency
,
frustrated
the
effort
of
the
american
commander
to
bring
on
a
decisive
action
.
captain
chauncey
wa
able
,
however
,
to
establish
an
ascendancy
on
that
important
theater
,
and
to
prove
by
the
manner
in
which
he
effected
everything
possible
that
opportunity
only
were
wanted
for
a
more
shining
display
of
his
own
talent
and
the
gallantry
of
those
under
his
command
.
the
success
on
lake
erie
having
opened
a
passage
to
the
territory
of
the
enemy
,
the
officer
commanding
the
northwestern
army
transferred
the
war
thither
,
and
rapidly
pursuing
the
hostile
troop
,
fleeing
with
their
savage
associate
,
forced
a
general
action
,
which
quickly
terminated
in
the
capture
of
the
british
and
dispersion
of
the
savage
force
.
this
result
is
signally
honorable
to
major-general
harrison
,
by
whose
military
talent
it
wa
prepared
;
to
colonel
johnson
and
his
mounted
volunteer
,
whose
impetuous
onset
gave
a
decisive
blow
to
the
rank
of
the
enemy
,
and
to
the
spirit
of
the
volunteer
militia
,
equally
brave
and
patriotic
,
who
bore
an
interesting
part
in
the
scene
;
more
especially
to
the
chief
magistrate
of
kentucky
,
at
the
head
of
them
,
whose
heroism
signalized
in
the
war
which
established
the
independence
of
his
country
,
sought
at
an
advanced
age
a
share
in
hardship
and
battle
for
maintaining
it
right
and
it
safely
.
the
effect
of
these
success
ha
been
to
rescue
the
inhabitant
of
mi
from
their
oppression
,
aggravated
by
gross
infraction
of
the
capitulation
which
subjected
them
to
a
foreign
power
;
to
alienate
the
savage
of
numerous
tribe
from
the
enemy
,
by
whom
they
were
disappointed
and
abandoned
,
and
to
relieve
an
extensive
region
of
country
from
a
merciless
warfare
which
desolated
it
frontier
and
imposed
on
it
citizen
the
most
harassing
service
.
in
consequence
of
our
naval
superiority
on
lake
ontario
and
the
opportunity
afforded
by
it
for
concentrating
our
force
by
water
,
operation
which
had
been
provisionally
planned
were
set
on
foot
against
the
possession
of
the
enemy
on
the
st.
lawrence
.
such
,
however
,
wa
the
delay
produced
in
the
1st
instance
by
adverse
weather
of
unusual
violence
and
continuance
and
such
the
circumstance
attending
the
final
movement
of
the
army
,
that
the
prospect
,
at
one
time
so
favorable
,
wa
not
realized
.
the
cruelty
of
the
enemy
in
enlisting
the
savage
into
a
war
with
a
nation
desirous
of
mutual
emulation
in
mitigating
it
calamity
ha
not
been
confined
to
any
one
quarter
.
wherever
they
could
be
turned
against
u
no
exertion
to
effect
it
have
been
spared
.
on
our
southwestern
border
the
creek
tribe
,
who
,
yielding
to
our
persevering
endeavor
,
were
gradually
acquiring
more
civilized
habit
,
became
the
unfortunate
victim
of
seduction
.
a
war
in
that
quarter
ha
been
the
consequence
,
infuriated
by
a
bloody
fanaticism
recently
propagated
among
them
.
it
wa
necessary
to
crush
such
a
war
before
it
could
spread
among
the
contiguous
tribe
and
before
it
could
favor
enterprise
of
the
enemy
into
that
vicinity
.
with
this
view
a
force
wa
called
into
the
service
of
the
united
state
from
the
state
of
georgia
and
tennessee
,
which
,
with
the
nearest
regular
troop
and
other
corp
from
the
mississippi
territory
,
might
not
only
chastise
the
savage
into
present
peace
but
make
a
lasting
impression
on
their
fear
.
the
progress
of
the
expedition
,
a
far
a
is
yet
known
,
corresponds
with
the
martial
zeal
with
which
it
wa
espoused
,
and
the
best
hope
of
a
satisfactory
issue
are
authorized
by
the
complete
success
with
which
a
well-planned
enterprise
wa
executed
against
a
body
of
hostile
savage
by
a
detachment
of
the
volunteer
militia
of
tn
,
under
the
gallant
command
of
general
coffee
,
and
by
a
still
more
important
victory
over
a
larger
body
of
them
,
gained
under
the
immediate
command
of
major-general
jackson
,
an
officer
equally
distinguished
for
his
patriotism
and
his
military
talent
.
the
systematic
perseverance
of
the
enemy
in
courting
the
aid
of
the
savage
in
all
quarter
had
the
natural
effect
of
kindling
their
ordinary
propensity
to
war
into
a
passion
,
which
,
even
among
those
best
disposed
toward
the
united
state
,
wa
ready
,
if
not
employed
on
our
side
,
to
be
turned
against
u
.
a
departure
from
our
protracted
forbearance
to
accept
the
service
tendered
by
them
ha
thus
been
forced
upon
u
.
but
in
yielding
to
it
the
retaliation
ha
been
mitigated
a
much
a
possible
,
both
in
it
extent
and
in
it
character
,
stopping
far
short
of
the
example
of
the
enemy
,
who
owe
the
advantage
they
have
occasionally
gained
in
battle
chiefly
to
the
#
of
their
savage
associate
,
and
who
have
not
controlled
them
either
from
their
usual
practice
of
indiscriminate
massacre
on
defenseless
inhabitant
or
from
scene
of
carnage
without
a
parallel
on
prisoner
to
the
british
arm
,
guarded
by
all
the
law
of
humanity
and
of
honorable
war
.
for
these
enormity
the
enemy
are
equally
responsible
,
whether
with
the
power
to
prevent
them
they
want
the
will
or
with
the
knowledge
of
a
want
of
power
they
still
avail
themselves
of
such
instrument
.
in
other
respect
the
enemy
are
pursuing
a
course
which
threatens
consequence
most
afflicting
to
humanity
.
a
standing
law
of
great
britain
naturalizes
,
a
is
well
known
,
all

with

limited
to
a
shorter
period
than
those
required
by
the
united

,
and
naturalized

in
war
employed
by
her
government
in
common
with
native
subject
.
in
a
contiguous
british
province
regulation
promulgated
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
compel
citizen
of
the
united
state
being
there
under
certain
circumstance
to
bear
arm
,
whilst
of
the
native
emigrant
from
the
united
state
,
who
compose
much
of
the
population
of
the
province
,
a
number
have
actually
borne
arm
against
the
united
state
within
their
limit
,
some
of
whom
,
after
having
done
so
,
have
become
prisoner
of
war
,
and
are
now
in
our
possession
.
the
british
commander
in
that
province
,
nevertheless
,
with
the
sanction
,
a
appears
,
of
his
government
,
thought
proper
to
select
from
american
prisoner
of
war
and
send
to
great
britain
for
trial
a
criminal
a
#
of
individual
who
had
emigrated
from
the
british
dominion
long
prior
to
the
state
of
war
between
the
two
nation
,
who
had
incorporated
themselves
into
our
political
society
in
the
mode
recognized
by
the
law
and
the
practice
of
great
britain
,
and
who
were
made
prisoner
of
war
under
the
banner
of
their
adopted
country
,
fighting
for
it
right
and
it
safety
.
the
protection
due
to
these
citizen
requiring
an
effectual
interposition
in
their
behalf
,
a
like
number
of
british
prisoner
of
war
were
put
into
confinement
,
with
a
notification
that
they
would
experience
whatever
violence
might
be
committed
on
the
american
prisoner
of
war
sent
to
great
britain
.
it
wa
hoped
that
this
necessary
consequence
of
the
step
unadvisedly
taken
on
the
part
of
great
britain
would
have
led
her
government
to
reflect
on
the
inconsistency
of
it
conduct
,
and
that
a
sympathy
with
the
british
,
if
not
with
the
american
,
sufferer
would
have
arrested
the
cruel
career
opened
by
it
example
.
this
wa
unhappily
not
the
case
.
in
violation
both
of
consistency
and
of
humanity
,
american
officer
and
non-commissioned
officer
in
double
the
number
of
the
british
soldier
confined
here
were
ordered
into
close
confinement
,
with
formal
notice
that
in
the
event
of
a
retaliation
for
the
death
which
might
be
inflicted
on
the
prisoner
of
war
sent
to
great
britain
for
trial
the
officer
so
confined
would
be
put
to
death
also
.
it
wa
notified
at
the
same
time
that
the
commander
of
the
british
fleet
and
army
on
our
coast
are
instructed
in
the
same
event
to
proceed
with
a
destructive
severity
against
our
town
and
their
inhabitant
.
that
no
doubt
might
be
left
with
the
enemy
of
our
adherence
to
the
retaliatory
resort
imposed
on
u
,
a
correspondent
number
of
british
officer
,
prisoner
of
war
in
our
hand
,
were
immediately
put
into
close
confinement
to
abide
the
fate
of
those
confined
by
the
enemy
,
and
the
british
government
wa
apprised
of
the
determination
of
this
government
to
retaliate
any
other
proceeding
against
u
contrary
to
the
legitimate
mode
of
warfare
.
it
is
fortunate
for
the
united
state
that
they
have
it
in
their
power
to
meet
the
enemy
in
this
deplorable
contest
a
it
is
honorable
to
them
that
they
do
not
join
in
it
but
under
the
most
imperious
obligation
,
and
with
the
humane
purpose
of
effectuating
a
return
to
the
established
usage
of
war
.
the
view
of
the
french
government
on
the
subject
which
have
been
so
long
committed
to
negotiation
have
received
no
elucidation
since
the
close
of
your
late
session
.
the
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
state
at
paris
had
not
been
enabled
by
proper
opportunity
to
press
the
object
of
his
mission
a
prescribed
by
his
instruction
.
the
militia
being
always
to
be
regarded
a
the
great
bulwark
of
defense
and
security
for
free
state
,
and
the
constitution
having
wisely
committed
to
the
national
authority
a
use
of
that
force
a
the
best
provision
against
an
unsafe
military
establishment
,
a
well
a
a
resource
peculiarly
adapted
to
a
country
having
the
extent
and
the
exposure
of
the
united
state
,
i
recommend
to
congress
a
revision
of
the
militia
law
for
the
purpose
of
securing
more
effectually
the
service
of
all
detachment
called
into
the
employment
and
placed
under
the
government
of
the
united
state
.
it
will
deserve
the
consideration
of
congress
also
whether
among
other
improvement
in
the
militia
law
justice
doe
not
require
a
regulation
,
under
due
precaution
,
for
defraying
the
expense
incident
to
the
1st
assembling
a
well
a
the
subsequent
movement
of
detachment
called
into
the
national
service
.
to
give
to
our
vessel
of
war
,
public
and
private
,
the
requisite
advantage
in
their
cruise
,
it
is
of
much
importance
that
they
should
have
,
both
for
themselves
and
their
prize
,
the
use
of
the
port
and
market
of
friendly
power
.
with
this
view
,
i
recommend
to
congress
the
expediency
of
such
legal
provision
a
may
supply
the
defect
or
remove
the
doubt
of
the
executive
authority
,
to
allow
to
the
cruiser
of
other
power
at
war
with
enemy
of
the
united
state
such
use
of
the
american
port
a
may
correspond
with
the
privilege
allowed
by
such
power
to
american
cruiser
.
during
the
year
ending
on
the
30
of
september
last
the
receipt
into
the
treasury
have
exceeded
$
37.5m
,
of
which
near
$
24m
were
the
produce
of
loan
.
after
meeting
all
demand
for
the
public
service
there
remained
in
the
treasury
on
that
day
near
$
7m
.
under
the
authority
contained
in
the
act
of
the
2nd
of
august
last
for
borrowing
$
7.5m
,
that
sum
ha
been
obtained
on
term
more
favorable
to
the
united
state
than
those
of
the
preceding
loan
made
during
the
present
year
.
further
sum
to
a
considerable
amount
will
be
necessary
to
be
obtained
in
the
same
way
during
the
ensuing
year
,
and
from
the
increased
capital
of
the
country
,
from
the
fidelity
with
which
the
public
engagement
have
been
kept
and
the
public
credit
maintained
,
it
may
be
expected
on
good
ground
that
the
necessary
pecuniary
supply
will
not
be
wanting
.
the
expense
of
the
current
year
,
from
the
multiplied
operation
falling
within
it
,
have
necessarily
been
extensive
;
but
on
a
just
estimate
of
the
campaign
in
which
the
mass
of
them
ha
been
incurred
the
cost
will
not
be
found
disproportionate
to
the
advantage
which
have
been
gained
.
the
campaign
ha
,
indeed
,
in
it
latter
stage
in
one
quarter
been
le
favorable
than
wa
expected
,
but
in
addition
to
the
importance
of
our
naval
success
the
progress
of
the
campaign
ha
been
filled
with
incident
highly
honorable
to
the
american
arm
.
the
attack
of
the
enemy
on
craney
island
,
on
fort
meigs
,
on
sackett
's
harbor
,
and
on
sandusky
have
been
vigorously
and
successfully
repulsed
;
nor
have
they
in
any
case
succeeded
on
either
frontier
excepting
when
directed
against
the
peaceable
dwelling
of
individual
or
village
unprepared
or
undefended
.
on
the
other
hand

the

of

army
have
been
followed

of

of

;
by

recovery

canada
.
battle
have
also
been
fought
on
the
border
of
the
st.
lawrence
,
which
,
though
not
accomplishing
their
entire
object
,
reflect
honor
on
the
discipline
and
prowess
of
our
soldiery
,
the
best
augury
of
eventual
victory
.
in
the
same
scale
are
to
be
placed
the
late
success
in
the
south
over
one
of
the
most
powerful
,
which
had
become
one
of
the
most
hostile
also
,
of
the
indian
tribe
.
it
would
be
improper
to
close
this
communication
without
expressing
a
thankfulness
in
which
all
ought
to
unite
for
the
abundance
;
for
the
preservation
of
our
internal
tranquility
,
and
the
stability
of
our
free
institution
,
and
,
above
all
,
for
the
light
of
divine
truth
and
the
protection
of
every
man
's
conscience
in
the
enjoyment
of
it
.
and
although
among
our
blessing
we
can
not
number
an
exemption
from
the
evil
of
war
,
yet
these
will
never
be
regarded
a
the
greatest
of
evil
by
the
friend
of
liberty
and
of
the
right
of
nation
.
our
country
ha
before
preferred
them
to
the
degraded
condition
which
wa
the
alternative
when
the
sword
wa
drawn
in
the
cause
which
gave
birth
to
our
national
independence
,
and
none
who
contemplate
the
magnitude
and
feel
the
value
of
that
glorious
event
will
shrink
from
a
struggle
to
maintain
the
high
and
happy
ground
on
which
it
placed
the
american
people
.
with
all
good
citizen
the
justice
and
necessity
of
resisting
wrong
and
usurpation
no
longer
to
be
borne
will
sufficiently
outweigh
the
privation
and
sacrifice
inseparable
from
a
state
of
war
.
but
it
is
a
reflection
,
moreover
,
peculiarly
consoling
,
that
,
whilst
war
are
generally
aggravated
by
their
baneful
effect
on
the
internal
improvement
and
permanent
prosperity
of
the
nation
engaged
in
them
,
such
is
the
favored
situation
of
the
united
state
that
the
calamity
of
the
contest
into
which
they
have
been
compelled
to
enter
are
mitigated
by
improvement
and
advantage
of
which
the
contest
itself
is
the
source
.
if
the
war
ha
increased
the
interruption
of
our
commerce
,
it
ha
at
the
same
time
cherished
and
multiplied
our
manufacture
so
a
to
make
u
independent
of
all
other
country
for
the
more
essential
branch
for
which
we
ought
to
be
dependent
on
none
,
and
is
even
rapidly
giving
them
an
extent
which
will
create
additional
staple
in
our
future
intercourse
with
foreign
market
.
if
much
treasure
ha
been
expended
,
no
inconsiderable
portion
of
it
ha
been
applied
to
object
durable
in
their
value
and
necessary
to
our
permanent
safety
.
if
the
war
ha
exposed
u
to
increased
spoliation
on
the
ocean
and
to
predatory
incursion
on
the
land
,
it
ha
developed
the
national
mean
of
retaliating
the
former
and
of
providing
protection
against
the
latter
,
demonstrating
to
all
that
every
blow
aimed
at
our
maritime
independence
is
an
impulse
accelerating
the
growth
of
our
maritime
power
.
by
diffusing
through
the
mass
of
the
nation
the
element
of
military
discipline
and
instruction
;
by
augmenting
and
distributing
warlike
preparation
applicable
to
future
use
;
by
evincing
the
zeal
and
valor
with
which
they
will
be
employed
and
the
cheerfulness
with
which
every
necessary
burden
will
be
borne
,
a
greater
respect
for
our
right
and
a
longer
duration
of
our
future
peace
are
promised
than
could
be
expected
without
these
proof
of
the
national
character
and
resource
.
the
war
ha
proved
moreover
that
our
free
government
,
like
other
free
government
,
though
slow
in
it
early
movement
,
acquires
in
it
progress
a
force
proportioned
to
it
freedom
,
and
that
the
union
of
these
state
,
the
guardian
of
the
freedom
and
safety
of
all
and
of
each
,
is
strengthened
by
every
occasion
that
put
it
to
the
test
.
in
fine
,
the
war
,
with
all
it
vicissitude
,
is
illustrating
the
capacity
and
the
destiny
of
the
united
state
to
be
a
great
,
a
flourishing
,
and
a
powerful
nation
,
worthy
of
the
friendship
which
it
is
disposed
to
cultivate
with
all
others
,
and
authorized
by
it
own
example
to
require
from
all
an
observance
of
the
law
of
justice
and
reciprocity
.
beyond
these
their
claim
have
never
extended
,
and
in
contending
for
these
we
behold
a
subject
for
our
congratulation
in
the
daily
testimony
of
increasing
harmony
throughout
the
nation
,
and
may
humbly
repose
our
trust
in
the
smile
of
heaven
on
so
righteous
a
cause
.
