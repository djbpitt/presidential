mr.
vice
president
,
mr.
speaker
,
member
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representative
:
i
wish
each
and
every
one
of
you
a
very
happy
new
year
.
a
the
congress
reassembles
,
the
impact
of
war
abroad
make
it
natural
to
approach
``
the
state
of
the
union
''
through
a
discussion
of
foreign
affair
.
but
it
is
important
that
those
who
hear
and
read
this
message
should
in
no
way
confuse
that
approach
with
any
thought
that
our
government
is
abandoning
,
or
even
overlooking
,
the
great
significance
of
it
domestic
policy
.
the
social
and
economic
force
which
have
been
mismanaged
abroad
until
they
have
resulted
in
revolution
,
dictatorship
and
war
are
the
same
a
those
which
we
here
are
struggling
to
adjust
peacefully
at
home
.
you
are
well
aware
that
dictatorships—and
the
philosophy
of
force
that
justifies
and
accompanies
dictatorships—have
originated
in
almost
every
case
in
the
necessity
for
drastic
action
to
improve
internal
condition
in
place
where
democratic
action
for
one
reason
or
another
ha
failed
to
respond
to
modern
need
and
modern
demand
.
it
wa
with
far-sighted
wisdom
that
the
framer
of
our
constitution
brought
together
in
one
magnificent
phrase
three
great
concepts—
''
common
defense
,
''
``
general
welfare
''
and
``
domestic
tranquility
.
''
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
later
we
,
who
are
here
today
,
still
believe
with
them
that
our
best
defense
is
the
promotion
of
our
general
welfare
and
domestic
tranquillity
.
in
previous
message
to
the
congress
i
have
repeatedly
warned
that
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
the
daily
life
of
american
citizen
will
,
of
necessity
,
feel
the
shock
of
event
on
other
continent
.
this
is
no
longer
mere
theory
;
because
it
ha
been
definitely
proved
to
u
by
the
fact
of
yesterday
and
today
.
to
say
that
the
domestic
well-being
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
million
american
is
deeply
affected
by
the
well-being
or
the
ill-being
of
the
population
of
other
nation
is
only
to
recognize
in
world
affair
the
truth
that
we
all
accept
in
home
affair
.
if
in
any
local
unit-a
city
,
county
,
state
or
region—low
standard
of
living
are
permitted
to
continue
,
the
level
of
the
civilization
of
the
entire
nation
will
be
pulled
downward
.
the
identical
principle
extends
to
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
.
but
there
are
those
who
wishfully
insist
,
in
innocence
or
ignorance
or
both
,
that
the
united
state
of
america
a
a
self-contained
unit
can
live
happily
and
prosperously
,
it
future
secure
,
inside
a
high
wall
of
isolation
while
,
outside
,
the
rest
of
civilization
and
the
commerce
and
culture
of
mankind
are
shattered
.
i
can
understand
the
feeling
of
those
who
warn
the
nation
that
they
will
never
again
consent
to
the
sending
of
american
youth
to
fight
on
the
soil
of
europe
.
but
,
a
i
remember
,
nobody
ha
asked
them
to
consent—for
nobody
expects
such
an
undertaking
.
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
fellow
citizen
do
not
abandon
in
the
slightest
their
hope
and
their
expectation
that
the
united
state
will
not
become
involved
in
military
participation
in
these
war
.
i
can
also
understand
the
wishfulness
of
those
who
oversimplify
the
whole
situation
by
repeating
that
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
mind
our
own
business
and
keep
the
nation
out
of
war
.
but
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
keeping
out
of
war
and
pretending
that
this
war
is
none
of
our
business
.
we
do
not
have
to
go
to
war
with
other
nation
,
but
at
least
we
can
strive
with
other
nation
to
encourage
the
kind
of
peace
that
will
lighten
the
trouble
of
the
world
,
and
by
so
doing
help
our
own
nation
a
well
.
i
ask
that
all
of
u
everywhere
think
thing
through
with
the
single
aim
of
how
best
to
serve
the
future
of
our
own
nation
.
i
do
not
mean
merely
it
future
relationship
with
the
outside
world
.
i
mean
it
domestic
future
a
well—the
work
,
the
security
,
the
prosperity
,
the
happiness
,
the
life
of
all
the
boy
and
girl
in
the
united
state
,
a
they
are
inevitably
affected
by
such
world
relationship
.
for
it
becomes
clearer
and
clearer
that
the
future
world
will
be
a
shabby
and
dangerous
place
to
live
in-yes
,
even
for
american
to
live
in—if
it
is
ruled
by
force
in
the
hand
of
a
few
.
already
the
crash
of
swiftly
moving
event
over
the
earth
ha
made
u
all
think
with
a
longer
view
.
fortunately
,
that
thinking
can
not
be
controlled
by
partisanship
.
the
time
is
long
past
when
any
political
party
or
any
particular
group
can
curry
or
capture
public
favor
by
labeling
itself
the
``
peace
party
''
or
the
``
peace
bloc
.
''
that
label
belongs
to
the
whole
united
state
and
to
every
right
thinking
man
,
woman
and
child
within
it
.
for
out
of
all
the
military
and
diplomatic
turmoil
,
out
of
all
the
propaganda
,
and
counter-propaganda
of
the
present
conflict
,
there
are
two
fact
which
stand
out
,
and
which
the
whole
world
acknowledges
.
the
first
is
that
never
before
ha
the
government
of
the
united
state
of
america
done
so
much
a
in
our
recent
past
to
establish
and
maintain
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor
with
it
sister
nation
.
the
second
is
that
in
almost
every
nation
in
the
world
today
there
is
a
true
public
belief
that
the
united
state
ha
been
,
and
will
continue
to
be
,
a
potent
and
active
factor
in
seeking
the
reestablishment
of
world
peace
.
in
these
recent
year
we
have
had
a
clean
record
of
peace
and
good-will
.
it
is
an
open
book
that
can
not
be
twisted
or
defamed
.
it
is
a
record
that
must
be
continued
and
enlarged
.
so
i
hope
that
american
everywhere
will
work
out
for
themselves
the
several
alternative
which
lie
before
world
civilization
,
which
necessarily
includes
our
own
.
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
possibility
for
our
child
if
the
rest
of
the
world
come
to
be
dominated
by
concentrated
force
alone—even
though
today
we
are
a
very
great
and
a
very
powerful
nation
.
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
effect
on
our
own
future
if
all
the
small
nation
of
the
world
have
their
independence
snatched
from
them
or
become
mere
appendage
to
relatively
vast
and
powerful
military
system
.
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
kind
of
life
our
child
would
have
to
lead
if
a
large
part
of
the
rest
of
the
world
were
compelled
to
worship
a
god
imposed
by
a
military
ruler
,
or
were
forbidden
to
worship
god
at
all
;
if
the
rest
of
the
world
were
forbidden
to
read
and
hear
the
facts—the
daily
news
of
their
own
and
other
nations—if
they
were
deprived
of
the
truth
that
make
men
free
.
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
effect
on
our
future
generation
if
world
trade
is
controlled
by
any
nation
or
group
of
nation
'which
set
up
that
control
through
military
force
.
it
is
,
of
course
,
true
that
the
record
of
past
century
includes
destruction
of
many
small
nation
,
the
enslavement
of
people
,
and
the
building
of
empire
on
the
foundation
of
force
.
but
wholly
apart
from
the
greater
international
morality
which
we
seek
today
,
we
recognize
the
practical
fact
that
with
modern
weapon
and
modern
condition
,
modern
man
can
no
longer
lead
a
civilized
life
if
we
are
to
go
back
to
the
practice
of
war
and
conquest
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
century
.
summing
up
this
need
of
looking
ahead
,
and
in
word
of
common
sense
and
good
american
citizenship
.
i
hope
that
we
shall
have
fewer
american
ostrich
in
our
midst
.
it
is
not
good
for
the
ultimate
health
of
ostrich
to
bury
their
head
in
the
sand
.
only
an
ostrich
would
look
upon
these
war
through
the
eye
of
cynicism
or
ridicule
.
of
course
,
the
people
of
other
nation
have
the
right
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
.
but
we
in
this
nation
still
believe
that
such
choice
should
be
predicated
on
certain
freedom
which
we
think
are
essential
everywhere
.
we
know
that
we
ourselves
shall
never
be
wholly
safe
at
home
unless
other
government
recognize
such
freedom
.
twenty-one
american
republic
,
expressing
the
will
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
people
to
preserve
peace
and
freedom
in
this
hemisphere
,
are
displaying
a
unanimity
of
ideal
and
practical
relationship
which
give
hope
that
what
is
being
done
here
can
be
done
on
other
continent
.
we
in
all
the
america
are
coming
to
the
realization
that
we
can
retain
our
respective
nationality
without
,
at
the
same
time
,
threatening
the
national
existence
of
our
neighbor
.
such
truly
friendly
relationship
,
for
example
,
permit
u
to
follow
our
own
domestic
policy
with
reference
to
our
agricultural
product
,
while
at
the
same
time
we
have
the
privilege
of
trying
to
work
out
mutual
assistance
arrangement
for
a
world
distribution
of
world
agricultural
surplus
.
and
we
have
been
able
to
apply
the
same
simple
principle
to
many
manufactured
products—surpluses
of
which
must
be
sold
in
the
world
export
market
if
we
intend
to
continue
a
high
level
of
production
and
employment
.
for
many
year
after
the
world
war
blind
economic
selfishness
in
most
country
,
including
our
own
,
resulted
in
a
destructive
mine-field
of
trade
restriction
which
blocked
the
channel
of
commerce
among
nation
.
indeed
,
this
policy
wa
one
of
the
contributing
cause
of
existing
war
.
it
dammed
up
vast
unsalable
surplus
,
helping
to
bring
about
unemployment
and
suffering
in
the
united
state
and
everywhere
else
.
to
point
the
way
to
break
up
that
log-jam
our
trade
agreement
act
wa
passed-based
upon
a
policy
of
equality
of
treatment
among
nation
and
of
mutually
profitable
arrangement
of
trade
.
it
is
not
correct
to
infer
that
legislative
power
have
been
transferred
from
the
congress
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
.
everyone
recognizes
that
general
tariff
legislation
is
a
congressional
function
;
but
we
know
that
,
because
of
the
stupendous
task
involved
in
the
fashioning
and
the
passing
of
a
general
tariff
law
,
it
is
advisable
to
provide
at
time
of
emergency
some
flexibility
to
make
the
general
law
adjustable
to
quickly
changing
condition
.
we
are
in
such
a
time
today
.
our
present
trade
agreement
method
provides
a
temporary
flexibility
and
is
,
therefore
,
practical
in
the
best
sense
.
it
should
be
kept
alive
to
serve
our
trade
interests—agricultural
and
industrial—in
many
valuable
way
during
the
existing
war
.
but
what
is
more
important
,
the
trade
agreement
act
should
be
extended
a
an
indispensable
part
of
the
foundation
of
any
stable
and
enduring
peace
.
the
old
condition
of
world
trade
made
for
no
enduring
peace
;
and
when
the
time
come
,
the
united
state
must
use
it
influence
to
open
up
the
trade
channel
of
the
world
,
in
all
nation
,
in
order
that
no
one
nation
need
feel
compelled
in
later
day
to
seek
by
force
of
arm
what
it
can
well
gain
by
peaceful
conference
.
for
that
purpose
,
too
,
we
need
the
trade
agreement
act
even
more
today
than
when
it
wa
passed
.
i
emphasize
the
leadership
which
this
nation
can
take
when
the
time
come
for
a
renewal
of
world
peace
.
such
an
influence
will
be
greatly
weakened
if
this
government
becomes
a
dog
in
the
manger
of
trade
selfishness
.
the
first
president
of
the
united
state
warned
u
against
entangling
foreign
alliance
.
the
present
president
of
the
united
state
subscribes
to
and
follows
that
precept
.
i
hope
that
most
of
you
will
agree
that
trade
cooperation
with
the
rest
of
the
world
doe
not
violate
that
precept
in
any
way
.
even
a
through
these
trade
agreement
we
prepare
to
cooperate
in
a
world
that
want
peace
,
we
must
likewise
be
prepared
to
take
care
of
ourselves
if
the
world
can
not
attain
peace
.
for
several
year
past
we
have
been
compelled
to
strengthen
our
own
national
defense
.
that
ha
created
a
very
large
portion
of
our
treasury
deficit
.
this
year
in
the
light
of
continuing
world
uncertainty
,
i
am
asking
the
congress
for
army
and
navy
increase
which
are
based
not
on
panic
but
on
common
sense
.
they
are
not
a
great
a
enthusiastic
alarmist
seek
.
they
are
not
a
small
a
unrealistic
person
claiming
superior
private
information
would
demand
.
a
will
appear
in
the
annual
budget
tomorrow
,
the
only
important
increase
in
any
part
of
the
budget
is
the
estimate
for
national
defense
.
practically
all
other
important
item
show
a
reduction
.
but
you
know
,
you
ca
n't
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
too
.
therefore
,
in
the
hope
that
we
can
continue
in
these
day
of
increasing
economic
prosperity
to
reduce
the
federal
deficit
,
i
am
asking
the
congress
to
levy
sufficient
additional
tax
to
meet
the
emergency
spending
for
national
defense
.
behind
the
army
and
navy
,
of
course
,
lie
our
ultimate
line
of
defense—
''
the
general
welfare
''
of
our
people
.
we
can
not
report
,
despite
all
the
progress
that
we
have
made
in
our
domestic
problems—despite
the
fact
that
production
is
back
to
1929
levels—that
all
our
problem
are
solved
.
the
fact
of
unemployment
of
million
of
men
and
woman
remains
a
symptom
of
a
number
of
difficulty
in
our
economic
system
not
yet
adjusted
.
while
the
number
of
the
unemployed
ha
decreased
very
greatly
,
while
their
immediate
need
for
food
and
clothing-as
far
a
the
federal
government
is
concerned—have
been
largely
met
,
while
their
morale
ha
been
kept
alive
by
giving
them
useful
public
work
,
we
have
not
yet
found
a
way
to
employ
the
surplus
of
our
labor
which
the
efficiency
of
our
industrial
process
ha
created
.
we
refuse
the
european
solution
of
using
the
unemployed
to
build
up
excessive
armament
which
eventually
result
in
dictatorship
and
war
.
we
encourage
an
american
way—through
an
increase
of
national
income
which
is
the
only
way
we
can
be
sure
will
take
up
the
slack
.
much
progress
ha
been
made
;
much
remains
to
be
done
.
we
recognize
that
we
must
find
an
answer
in
term
of
work
and
opportunity
.
the
unemployment
problem
today
ha
become
very
definitely
a
problem
of
youth
a
well
a
of
age
.
a
each
year
ha
gone
by
hundred
of
thousand
of
boy
and
girl
have
come
of
working
age
.
they
now
form
an
army
of
unused
youth
.
they
must
be
an
especial
concern
of
democratic
government
.
we
must
continue
,
above
all
thing
,
to
look
for
a
solution
of
their
special
problem
.
for
they
,
looking
ahead
to
life
,
are
entitled
to
action
on
our
part
and
not
merely
to
admonition
of
optimism
or
lecture
on
economic
law
.
some
in
our
midst
have
sought
to
instill
a
feeling
of
fear
and
defeatism
in
the
mind
of
the
american
people
about
this
problem
.
to
face
the
task
of
finding
job
faster
than
invention
can
take
them
away—is
not
defeatism
.
to
warble
easy
platitude
that
if
we
would
only
go
back
to
way
that
have
failed
,
everything
would
be
all
right—is
not
courage
.
in
1933
we
met
a
problem
of
real
fear
and
real
defeatism
.
we
faced
the
facts—with
action
and
not
with
word
alone
.
the
american
people
will
reject
the
doctrine
of
fear
,
confident
that
in
the
'thirties
we
have
been
building
soundly
a
new
order
of
thing
,
different
from
the
order
of
the
'twenties
.
in
this
dawn
of
the
decade
of
the
'forties
,
with
our
program
of
social
improvement
started
,
we
will
continue
to
carry
on
the
process
of
recovery
,
so
a
to
preserve
our
gain
and
provide
job
at
living
wage
.
there
are
,
of
course
,
many
other
item
of
great
public
interest
which
could
be
enumerated
in
this
message—the
continued
conservation
of
our
natural
resource
,
the
improvement
of
health
and
of
education
,
the
extension
of
social
security
to
larger
group
,
the
freeing
of
large
area
from
restricted
transportation
discrimination
,
the
extension
of
the
merit
system
and
many
others
.
our
continued
progress
in
the
social
and
economic
field
is
important
not
only
for
the
significance
of
each
part
of
it
but
for
the
total
effect
which
our
program
of
domestic
betterment
ha
upon
that
most
valuable
asset
of
a
nation
in
dangerous
times—its
national
unity
.
the
permanent
security
of
america
in
the
present
crisis
doe
not
lie
in
armed
force
alone
.
what
we
face
is
a
set
of
world-wide
force
of
disintegration—vicious
,
ruthless
,
destructive
of
all
the
moral
,
religious
and
political
standard
which
mankind
,
after
century
of
struggle
,
ha
come
to
cherish
most
.
in
these
moral
value
,
in
these
force
which
have
made
our
nation
great
,
we
must
actively
and
practically
reassert
our
faith
.
these
words-
''
national
unity
''
-must
not
be
allowed
to
be
come
merely
a
high-sounding
phrase
,
a
vague
generality
,
a
pious
hope
,
to
which
everyone
can
give
lip-service
.
they
must
be
made
to
have
real
meaning
in
term
of
the
daily
thought
and
act
of
every
man
,
woman
and
child
in
our
land
during
the
coming
year
and
during
the
year
that
lie
ahead
.
for
national
unity
is
,
in
a
very
real
and
a
very
deep
sense
,
the
fundamental
safeguard
of
all
democracy
.
doctrine
that
set
group
against
group
,
faith
against
faith
,
race
against
race
,
class
against
class
,
fanning
the
fire
of
hatred
in
men
too
despondent
,
too
desperate
to
think
for
themselves
,
were
used
a
rabble-rousing
slogan
on
which
dictator
could
ride
to
power
.
and
once
in
power
they
could
saddle
their
tyranny
on
whole
nation
and
on
their
weaker
neighbor
.
this
is
the
danger
to
which
we
in
america
must
begin
to
be
more
alert
.
for
the
apologist
for
foreign
aggressor
,
and
equally
those
selfish
and
partisan
group
at
home
who
wrap
themselves
in
a
false
mantle
of
americanism
to
promote
their
own
economic
,
financial
or
political
advantage
,
are
now
trying
european
trick
upon
u
,
seeking
to
muddy
the
stream
of
our
national
thinking
,
weakening
u
in
the
face
of
danger
,
by
trying
to
set
our
own
people
to
fighting
among
themselves
.
such
tactic
are
what
have
helped
to
plunge
europe
into
war
.
we
must
combat
them
,
a
we
would
the
plague
,
if
american
integrity
and
american
security
are
to
be
preserved
.
we
can
not
afford
to
face
the
future
a
a
disunited
people
.
we
must
a
a
united
people
keep
ablaze
on
this
continent
the
flame
of
human
liberty
,
of
reason
,
of
democracy
and
of
fair
play
a
living
thing
to
be
preserved
for
the
better
world
that
is
to
come
.
overstatement
,
bitterness
,
vituperation
,
and
the
beating
of
drum
have
contributed
mightily
to
ill-feeling
and
war
between
nation
.
if
these
unnecessary
and
unpleasant
action
are
harmful
in
the
international
field
,
if
they
have
hurt
in
other
part
of
the
world
,
they
are
also
harmful
in
the
domestic
scene
.
peace
among
ourselves
would
seem
to
have
some
of
the
advantage
of
peace
between
u
and
other
nation
.
in
the
long
run
history
amply
demonstrates
that
angry
controversy
surely
win
le
than
calm
discussion

in
the
spirit
,
therefore
,
of
a
greater
unselfishness
,
recognizing
that
the
world—including
the
united
state
of
america—passes
through
perilous
time
,
i
am
very
hopeful
that
the
closing
session
of
the
seventy-sixth
congress
will
consider
the
need
of
the
nation
and
of
humanity
with
calmness
,
with
tolerance
and
with
cooperative
wisdom
.
may
the
year
1940
be
pointed
to
by
our
child
a
another
period
when
democracy
justified
it
existence
a
the
best
instrument
of
government
yet
devised
by
mankind
.
