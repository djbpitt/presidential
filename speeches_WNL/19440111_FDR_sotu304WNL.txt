to
the
congress
:
this
nation
in
the
past
two
year
ha
become
an
active
partner
in
the
world
's
greatest
war
against
human
slavery
.
we
have
joined
with
like-minded
people
in
order
to
defend
ourselves
in
a
world
that
ha
been
gravely
threatened
with
gangster
rule
.
but
i
do
not
think
that
any
of
u
american
can
be
content
with
mere
survival
.
sacrifice
that
we
and
our
ally
are
making
impose
upon
u
all
a
sacred
obligation
to
see
to
it
that
out
of
this
war
we
and
our
child
will
gain
something
better
than
mere
survival
.
we
are
united
in
determination
that
this
war
shall
not
be
followed
by
another
interim
which
lead
to
new
disaster-
that
we
shall
not
repeat
the
tragic
error
of
ostrich
isolationism—that
we
shall
not
repeat
the
excess
of
the
wild
twenty
when
this
nation
went
for
a
joy
ride
on
a
roller
coaster
which
ended
in
a
tragic
crash
.
when
mr
.
hull
went
to
moscow
in
october
,
and
when
i
went
to
cairo
and
teheran
in
november
,
we
knew
that
we
were
in
agreement
with
our
ally
in
our
common
determination
to
fight
and
win
this
war
.
but
there
were
many
vital
question
concerning
the
future
peace
,
and
they
were
discussed
in
an
atmosphere
of
complete
candor
and
harmony
.
in
the
last
war
such
discussion
,
such
meeting
,
did
not
even
begin
until
the
shooting
had
stopped
and
the
delegate
began
to
assemble
at
the
peace
table
.
there
had
been
no
previous
opportunity
for
man-to-man
discussion
which
lead
to
meeting
of
mind
.
the
result
wa
a
peace
which
wa
not
a
peace
.
that
wa
a
mistake
which
we
are
not
repeating
in
this
war
.
and
right
here
i
want
to
address
a
word
or
two
to
some
suspicious
soul
who
are
fearful
that
mr
.
hull
or
i
have
made
``
commitment
''
for
the
future
which
might
pledge
this
nation
to
secret
treaty
,
or
to
enacting
the
role
of
santa
claus
.
to
such
suspicious
souls—using
a
polite
terminology—i
wish
to
say
that
mr.
churchill
,
and
marshal
stalin
,
and
generalissimo
chiang
kai-shek
are
all
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
provision
of
our
constitution
.
and
so
is
mr
.
hull
.
and
so
am
i
.
of
course
we
made
some
commitment
.
we
most
certainly
committed
ourselves
to
very
large
and
very
specific
military
plan
which
require
the
use
of
all
allied
force
to
bring
about
the
defeat
of
our
enemy
at
the
earliest
possible
time
.
but
there
were
no
secret
treaty
or
political
or
financial
commitment
.
the
one
supreme
objective
for
the
future
,
which
we
discussed
for
each
nation
individually
,
and
for
all
the
united
nation
,
can
be
summed
up
in
one
word
:
security
.
and
that
mean
not
only
physical
security
which
provides
safety
from
attack
by
aggressor
.
it
mean
also
economic
security
,
social
security
,
moral
security—in
a
family
of
nation
.
in
the
plain
down-to-earth
talk
that
i
had
with
the
generalissimo
and
marshal
stalin
and
prime
minister
churchill
,
it
wa
abundantly
clear
that
they
are
all
most
deeply
interested
in
the
resumption
of
peaceful
progress
by
their
own
peoples—progress
toward
a
better
life
.
all
our
ally
want
freedom
to
develop
their
land
and
resource
,
to
build
up
industry
,
to
increase
education
and
individual
opportunity
,
and
to
raise
standard
of
living
.
all
our
ally
have
learned
by
bitter
experience
that
real
development
will
not
be
possible
if
they
are
to
be
diverted
from
their
purpose
by
repeated
wars—or
even
threat
of
war
.
china
and
russia
are
truly
united
with
britain
and
america
in
recognition
of
this
essential
fact
:
the
best
interest
of
each
nation
,
large
and
small
,
demand
that
all
freedom-loving
nation
shall
join
together
in
a
just
and
durable
system
of
peace
.
in
the
present
world
situation
,
evidenced
by
the
action
of
germany
,
italy
,
and
japan
,
unquestioned
military
control
over
disturber
of
the
peace
is
a
necessary
among
nation
a
it
is
among
citizen
in
a
community
.
and
an
equally
basic
essential
to
peace
is
a
decent
standard
of
living
for
all
individual
men
and
woman
and
child
in
all
nation
.
freedom
from
fear
is
eternally
linked
with
freedom
from
want
.
there
are
people
who
burrow
through
our
nation
like
unseeing
mole
,
and
attempt
to
spread
the
suspicion
that
if
other
nation
are
encouraged
to
raise
their
standard
of
living
,
our
own
american
standard
of
living
must
of
necessity
be
depressed
.
the
fact
is
the
very
contrary
.
it
ha
been
shown
time
and
again
that
if
the
standard
of
living
of
any
country
go
up
,
so
doe
it
purchasing
power-
and
that
such
a
rise
encourages
a
better
standard
of
living
in
neighboring
country
with
whom
it
trade
.
that
is
just
plain
common
sense—and
it
is
the
kind
of
plain
common
sense
that
provided
the
basis
for
our
discussion
at
moscow
,
cairo
,
and
teheran
.
returning
from
my
journeying
,
i
must
confess
to
a
sense
of
``
let-down
''
when
i
found
many
evidence
of
faulty
perspective
here
in
washington
.
the
faulty
perspective
consists
in
overemphasizing
lesser
problem
and
thereby
underemphasizing
the
first
and
greatest
problem
.
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
people
have
met
the
demand
of
this
war
with
magnificent
courage
and
understanding
.
they
have
accepted
inconvenience
;
they
have
accepted
hardship
;
they
have
accepted
tragic
sacrifice
.
and
they
are
ready
and
eager
to
make
whatever
further
contribution
are
needed
to
win
the
war
a
quickly
a
possible-
if
only
they
are
given
the
chance
to
know
what
is
required
of
them
.
however
,
while
the
majority
go
on
about
it
great
work
without
complaint
,
a
noisy
minority
maintains
an
uproar
of
demand
for
special
favor
for
special
group
.
there
are
pest
who
swarm
through
the
lobby
of
the
congress
and
the
cocktail
bar
of
washington
,
representing
these
special
group
a
opposed
to
the
basic
interest
of
the
nation
a
a
whole
.
they
have
come
to
look
upon
the
war
primarily
a
a
chance
to
make
profit
for
themselves
at
the
expense
of
their
neighbors-
profit
in
money
or
in
term
of
political
or
social
preferment
.
such
selfish
agitation
can
be
highly
dangerous
in
wartime
.
it
creates
confusion
.
it
damage
morale
.
it
hamper
our
national
effort
.
it
muddies
the
water
and
therefore
prolongs
the
war
.
if
we
analyze
american
history
impartially
,
we
can
not
escape
the
fact
that
in
our
past
we
have
not
always
forgotten
individual
and
selfish
and
partisan
interest
in
time
of
war—we
have
not
always
been
united
in
purpose
and
direction
.
we
can
not
overlook
the
serious
dissension
and
the
lack
of
unity
in
our
war
of
the
revolution
,
in
our
war
of
1812
,
or
in
our
war
between
the
state
,
when
the
survival
of
the
union
itself
wa
at
stake
.
in
the
first
world
war
we
came
closer
to
national
unity
than
in
any
previous
war
.
but
that
war
lasted
only
a
year
and
a
half
,
and
increasing
sign
of
disunity
began
to
appear
during
the
final
month
of
the
conflict
.
in
this
war
,
we
have
been
compelled
to
learn
how
interdependent
upon
each
other
are
all
group
and
section
of
the
population
of
america
.
increased
food
cost
,
for
example
,
will
bring
new
demand
for
wage
increase
from
all
war
worker
,
which
will
in
turn
raise
all
price
of
all
thing
including
those
thing
which
the
farmer
themselves
have
to
buy
.
increased
wage
or
price
will
each
in
turn
produce
the
same
result
.
they
all
have
a
particularly
disastrous
result
on
all
fixed
income
group
.
and
i
hope
you
will
remember
that
all
of
u
in
this
government
represent
the
fixed
income
group
just
a
much
a
we
represent
business
owner
,
worker
,
and
farmer
.
this
group
of
fixed
income
people
includes
:
teacher
,
clergy
,
policeman
,
fireman
,
widow
and
minor
on
fixed
income
,
wife
and
dependent
of
our
soldier
and
sailor
,
and
old-age
pensioner
.
they
and
their
family
add
up
to
one-quarter
of
our
one
hundred
and
thirty
million
people
.
they
have
few
or
no
high
pressure
representative
at
the
capitol
.
in
a
period
of
gross
inflation
they
would
be
the
worst
sufferer
.
if
ever
there
wa
a
time
to
subordinate
individual
or
group
selfishness
to
the
national
good
,
that
time
is
now
.
disunity
at
home—bickerings
,
self-seeking
partisanship
,
stoppage
of
work
,
inflation
,
business
a
usual
,
politics
a
usual
,
luxury
a
usual
these
are
the
influence
which
can
undermine
the
morale
of
the
brave
men
ready
to
die
at
the
front
for
u
here
.
those
who
are
doing
most
of
the
complaining
are
not
deliberately
striving
to
sabotage
the
national
war
effort
.
they
are
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
time
is
past
when
we
must
make
prodigious
sacrifices-
that
the
war
is
already
won
and
we
can
begin
to
slacken
off
.
but
the
dangerous
folly
of
that
point
of
view
can
be
measured
by
the
distance
that
separate
our
troop
from
their
ultimate
objective
in
berlin
and
tokyo—and
by
the
sum
of
all
the
peril
that
lie
along
the
way
.
overconfidence
and
complacency
are
among
our
deadliest
enemy
.
last
spring—after
notable
victory
at
stalingrad
and
in
tunisia
and
against
the
u-boat
on
the
high
seas—overconfidence
became
so
pronounced
that
war
production
fell
off
.
in
two
month
,
june
and
july
,
1943
,
more
than
a
thousand
airplane
that
could
have
been
made
and
should
have
been
made
were
not
made
.
those
who
failed
to
make
them
were
not
on
strike
.
they
were
merely
saying
,
``
the
war
's
in
the
bag-
so
let
's
relax
.
''
that
attitude
on
the
part
of
anyone—government
or
management
or
labor—can
lengthen
this
war
.
it
can
kill
american
boy
.
let
u
remember
the
lesson
of
1918
.
in
the
summer
of
that
year
the
tide
turned
in
favor
of
the
ally
.
but
this
government
did
not
relax
.
in
fact
,
our
national
effort
wa
stepped
up
.
in
august
,
1918
,
the
draft
age
limit
were
broadened
from
21-31
to
18-45
.
the
president
called
for
``
force
to
the
utmost
,
''
and
his
call
wa
heeded
.
and
in
november
,
only
three
month
later
,
germany
surrendered
.
that
is
the
way
to
fight
and
win
a
war—all
out—and
not
with
half-an-eye
on
the
battlefront
abroad
and
the
other
eye-and-a-half
on
personal
,
selfish
,
or
political
interest
here
at
home
.
therefore
,
in
order
to
concentrate
all
our
energy
and
resource
on
winning
the
war
,
and
to
maintain
a
fair
and
stable
economy
at
home
,
i
recommend
that
the
congress
adopt
:
(
1
)
a
realistic
tax
law—which
will
tax
all
unreasonable
profit
,
both
individual
and
corporate
,
and
reduce
the
ultimate
cost
of
the
war
to
our
son
and
daughter
.
the
tax
bill
now
under
consideration
by
the
congress
doe
not
begin
to
meet
this
test
.
(
2
)
a
continuation
of
the
law
for
the
renegotiation
of
war
contracts—which
will
prevent
exorbitant
profit
and
assure
fair
price
to
the
government
.
for
two
long
year
i
have
pleaded
with
the
congress
to
take
undue
profit
out
of
war
.
(
3
)
a
cost
of
food
law—which
will
enable
the
government
(
a
)
to
place
a
reasonable
floor
under
the
price
the
farmer
may
expect
for
his
production
;
and
(
b
)
to
place
a
ceiling
on
the
price
a
consumer
will
have
to
pay
for
the
food
he
buy
.
this
should
apply
to
necessity
only
;
and
will
require
public
fund
to
carry
out
.
it
will
cost
in
appropriation
about
one
percent
of
the
present
annual
cost
of
the
war
.
(
4
)
early
reenactment
of
.
the
stabilization
statute
of
october
,
1942
.
this
expires
june
30
,
1944
,
and
if
it
is
not
extended
well
in
advance
,
the
country
might
just
a
well
expect
price
chaos
by
summer
.
we
can
not
have
stabilization
by
wishful
thinking
.
we
must
take
positive
action
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
american
dollar
.
(
5
)
a
national
service
law-
which
,
for
the
duration
of
the
war
,
will
prevent
strike
,
and
,
with
certain
appropriate
exception
,
will
make
available
for
war
production
or
for
any
other
essential
service
every
able-bodied
adult
in
this
nation
.
these
five
measure
together
form
a
just
and
equitable
whole
.
i
would
not
recommend
a
national
service
law
unless
the
other
law
were
passed
to
keep
down
the
cost
of
living
,
to
share
equitably
the
burden
of
taxation
,
to
hold
the
stabilization
line
,
and
to
prevent
undue
profit
.
the
federal
government
already
ha
the
basic
power
to
draft
capital
and
property
of
all
kind
for
war
purpose
on
a
basis
of
just
compensation
.
a
you
know
,
i
have
for
three
year
hesitated
to
recommend
a
national
service
act
.
today
,
however
,
i
am
convinced
of
it
necessity
.
although
i
believe
that
we
and
our
ally
can
win
the
war
without
such
a
measure
,
i
am
certain
that
nothing
le
than
total
mobilization
of
all
our
resource
of
manpower
and
capital
will
guarantee
an
earlier
victory
,
and
reduce
the
toll
of
suffering
and
sorrow
and
blood
.
i
have
received
a
joint
recommendation
for
this
law
from
the
head
of
the
war
department
,
the
navy
department
,
and
the
maritime
commission
.
these
are
the
men
who
bear
responsibility
for
the
procurement
of
the
necessary
arm
and
equipment
,
and
for
the
successful
prosecution
of
the
war
in
the
field
.
they
say
:
``
when
the
very
life
of
the
nation
is
in
peril
the
responsibility
for
service
is
common
to
all
men
and
woman
.
in
such
a
time
there
can
be
no
discrimination
between
the
men
and
woman
who
are
assigned
by
the
government
to
it
defense
at
the
battlefront
and
the
men
and
woman
assigned
to
producing
the
vital
material
essential
to
successful
military
operation
.
a
prompt
enactment
of
a
national
service
law
would
be
merely
an
expression
of
the
universality
of
this
responsibility
.
''
i
believe
the
country
will
agree
that
those
statement
are
the
solemn
truth
.
national
service
is
the
most
democratic
way
to
wage
a
war
.
like
selective
service
for
the
armed
force
,
it
rest
on
the
obligation
of
each
citizen
to
serve
his
nation
to
his
utmost
where
he
is
best
qualified
.
it
doe
not
mean
reduction
in
wage
.
it
doe
not
mean
loss
of
retirement
and
seniority
right
and
benefit
.
it
doe
not
mean
that
any
substantial
number
of
war
worker
will
be
disturbed
in
their
present
job
.
let
these
fact
be
wholly
clear
.
experience
in
other
democratic
nation
at
war—britain
,
canada
,
australia
,
and
new
zealand-
ha
shown
that
the
very
existence
of
national
service
make
unnecessary
the
widespread
use
of
compulsory
power
.
national
service
ha
proven
to
be
a
unifying
moral
force
based
on
an
equal
and
comprehensive
legal
obligation
of
all
people
in
a
nation
at
war
.
there
are
million
of
american
men
and
woman
who
are
not
in
this
war
at
all
.
it
is
not
because
they
do
not
want
to
be
in
it
.
but
they
want
to
know
where
they
can
best
do
their
share
.
national
service
provides
that
direction
.
it
will
be
a
mean
by
which
every
man
and
woman
can
find
that
inner
satisfaction
which
come
from
making
the
fullest
possible
contribution
to
victory
.
i
know
that
all
civilian
war
worker
will
be
glad
to
be
able
to
say
many
year
hence
to
their
grandchild
:
``
yes
,
i
,
too
,
wa
in
service
in
the
great
war
.
i
wa
on
duty
in
an
airplane
factory
,
and
i
helped
make
hundred
of
fighting
plane
.
the
government
told
me
that
in
doing
that
i
wa
performing
my
most
useful
work
in
the
service
of
my
country
.
''
it
is
argued
that
we
have
passed
the
stage
in
the
war
where
national
service
is
necessary
.
but
our
soldier
and
sailor
know
that
this
is
not
true
.
we
are
going
forward
on
a
long
,
rough
road-
and
,
in
all
journey
,
the
last
mile
are
the
hardest
.
and
it
is
for
that
final
effort—for
the
total
defeat
of
our
enemies-that
we
must
mobilize
our
total
resource
.
the
national
war
program
call
for
the
employment
of
more
people
in
1944
than
in
1943
.
it
is
my
conviction
that
the
american
people
will
welcome
this
win-the-war
measure
which
is
based
on
the
eternally
just
principle
of
``
fair
for
one
,
fair
for
all
.
''
it
will
give
our
people
at
home
the
assurance
that
they
are
standing
four-square
behind
our
soldier
and
sailor
.
and
it
will
give
our
enemy
demoralizing
assurance
that
we
mean
business
-that
we
,
130,000,000
american
,
are
on
the
march
to
rome
,
berlin
,
and
tokyo
.
i
hope
that
the
congress
will
recognize
that
,
although
this
is
a
political
year
,
national
service
is
an
issue
which
transcends
politics
.
great
power
must
be
used
for
great
purpose
.
a
to
the
machinery
for
this
measure
,
the
congress
itself
should
determine
it
nature—but
it
should
be
wholly
nonpartisan
in
it
make-up
.
our
armed
force
are
valiantly
fulfilling
their
responsibility
to
our
country
and
our
people
.
now
the
congress
face
the
responsibility
for
taking
those
measure
which
are
essential
to
national
security
in
this
the
most
decisive
phase
of
the
nation
's
greatest
war
.
several
alleged
reason
have
prevented
the
enactment
of
legislation
which
would
preserve
for
our
soldier
and
sailor
and
marine
the
fundamental
prerogative
of
citizenship—the
right
to
vote
.
no
amount
of
legalistic
argument
can
becloud
this
issue
in
the
eye
of
these
ten
million
american
citizen
.
surely
the
signer
of
the
constitution
did
not
intend
a
document
which
,
even
in
wartime
,
would
be
construed
to
take
away
the
franchise
of
any
of
those
who
are
fighting
to
preserve
the
constitution
itself
.
our
soldier
and
sailor
and
marine
know
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
will
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
vote
,
if
the
voting
machinery
is
left
exclusively
to
the
state
under
existing
state
laws—and
that
there
is
no
likelihood
of
these
law
being
changed
in
time
to
enable
them
to
vote
at
the
next
election
.
the
army
and
navy
have
reported
that
it
will
be
impossible
effectively
to
administer
forty-eight
different
soldier
voting
law
.
it
is
the
duty
of
the
congress
to
remove
this
unjustifiable
discrimination
against
the
men
and
woman
in
our
armed
forces-
and
to
do
it
a
quickly
a
possible
.
it
is
our
duty
now
to
begin
to
lay
the
plan
and
determine
the
strategy
for
the
winning
of
a
lasting
peace
and
the
establishment
of
an
american
standard
of
living
higher
than
ever
before
known
.
we
can
not
be
content
,
no
matter
how
high
that
general
standard
of
living
may
be
,
if
some
fraction
of
our
people—whether
it
be
one-third
or
one-fifth
or
one-tenth-
is
ill-fed
,
ill-clothed
,
ill
housed
,
and
insecure
.
this
republic
had
it
beginning
,
and
grew
to
it
present
strength
,
under
the
protection
of
certain
inalienable
political
rights—among
them
the
right
of
free
speech
,
free
press
,
free
worship
,
trial
by
jury
,
freedom
from
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
.
they
were
our
right
to
life
and
liberty
.
a
our
nation
ha
grown
in
size
and
stature
,
however—as
our
industrial
economy
expanded—these
political
right
proved
inadequate
to
assure
u
equality
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
.
we
have
come
to
a
clear
realization
of
the
fact
that
true
individual
freedom
can
not
exist
without
economic
security
and
independence
.
``
necessitous
men
are
not
free
men
.
''
people
who
are
hungry
and
out
of
a
job
are
the
stuff
of
which
dictatorship
are
made
.
in
our
day
these
economic
truth
have
become
accepted
a
self-evident
.
we
have
accepted
,
so
to
speak
,
a
second
bill
of
right
under
which
a
new
basis
of
security
and
prosperity
can
be
established
for
all
regardless
of
station
,
race
,
or
creed
.
among
these
are
:
the
right
to
a
useful
and
remunerative
job
in
the
industry
or
shop
or
farm
or
mine
of
the
nation
;
the
right
to
earn
enough
to
provide
adequate
food
and
clothing
and
recreation
;
the
right
of
every
farmer
to
raise
and
sell
his
product
at
a
return
which
will
give
him
and
his
family
a
decent
living
;
the
right
of
every
businessman
,
large
and
small
,
to
trade
in
an
atmosphere
of
freedom
from
unfair
competition
and
domination
by
monopoly
at
home
or
abroad
;
the
right
of
every
family
to
a
decent
home
;
the
right
to
adequate
medical
care
and
the
opportunity
to
achieve
and
enjoy
good
health
;
the
right
to
adequate
protection
from
the
economic
fear
of
old
age
,
sickness
,
accident
,
and
unemployment
;
the
right
to
a
good
education
.
all
of
these
right
spell
security
.
and
after
this
war
is
won
we
must
be
prepared
to
move
forward
,
in
the
implementation
of
these
right
,
to
new
goal
of
human
happiness
and
well-being
.
america
's
own
rightful
place
in
the
world
depends
in
large
part
upon
how
fully
these
and
similar
right
have
been
carried
into
practice
for
our
citizen
.
for
unless
there
is
security
here
at
home
there
can
not
be
lasting
peace
in
the
world
.
one
of
the
great
american
industrialist
of
our
day—a
man
who
ha
rendered
yeoman
service
to
his
country
in
this
crisis-recently
emphasized
the
grave
danger
of
``
rightist
reaction
''
in
this
nation
.
all
clear-thinking
businessmen
share
his
concern
.
indeed
,
if
such
reaction
should
develop—if
history
were
to
repeat
itself
and
we
were
to
return
to
the
so-called
``
normalcy
''
of
the
1920's—then
it
is
certain
that
even
though
we
shall
have
conquered
our
enemy
on
the
battlefield
abroad
,
we
shall
have
yielded
to
the
spirit
of
fascism
here
at
home
.
i
ask
the
congress
to
explore
the
mean
for
implementing
this
economic
bill
of
rights-
for
it
is
definitely
the
responsibility
of
the
congress
so
to
do
.
many
of
these
problem
are
already
before
committee
of
the
congress
in
the
form
of
proposed
legislation
.
i
shall
from
time
to
time
communicate
with
the
congress
with
respect
to
these
and
further
proposal
.
in
the
event
that
no
adequate
program
of
progress
is
evolved
,
i
am
certain
that
the
nation
will
be
conscious
of
the
fact
.
our
fighting
men
abroad-
and
their
family
at
home-
expect
such
a
program
and
have
the
right
to
insist
upon
it
.
it
is
to
their
demand
that
this
government
should
pay
heed
rather
than
to
the
whining
demand
of
selfish
pressure
group
who
seek
to
feather
their
nest
while
young
american
are
dying
.
the
foreign
policy
that
we
have
been
following—the
policy
that
guided
u
at
moscow
,
cairo
,
and
teheran—is
based
on
the
common
sense
principle
which
wa
best
expressed
by
benjamin
franklin
on
july
4
,
1776
:
``
we
must
all
hang
together
,
or
assuredly
we
shall
all
hang
separately
.
''
i
have
often
said
that
there
are
no
two
front
for
america
in
this
war
.
there
is
only
one
front
.
there
is
one
line
of
unity
which
extends
from
the
heart
of
the
people
at
home
to
the
men
of
our
attacking
force
in
our
farthest
outpost
.
when
we
speak
of
our
total
effort
,
we
speak
of
the
factory
and
the
field
,
and
the
mine
a
well
a
of
the
battleground
--
we
speak
of
the
soldier
and
the
civilian
,
the
citizen
and
his
government
.
each
and
every
one
of
u
ha
a
solemn
obligation
under
god
to
serve
this
nation
in
it
most
critical
hour—to
keep
this
nation
great
--
to
make
this
nation
greater
in
a
better
world
.
