fellow-citizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representative
:
at
the
period
of
our
last
meeting
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
communicating
an
adjustment
with
one
of
the
principal
belligerent
nation
,
highly
important
in
itself
,
and
still
more
so
a
presaging
a
more
extended
accommodation
.
it
is
with
deep
concern
i
am
now
to
inform
you
that
the
favorable
prospect
ha
been
over-clouded
by
a
refusal
of
the
british
government
to
abide
by
the
act
of
it
minister
plenipotentiary
,
and
by
it
ensuing
policy
toward
the
united
state
a
seen
through
the
communication
of
the
minister
sent
to
replace
him
.
whatever
plea
may
be
urged
for
a
disavowal
of
engagement
formed
by
diplomatic
functionary
in
case
where
by
the
term
of
the
engagement
a
mutual
ratification
is
reserved
,
or
where
notice
at
the
time
may
have
been
given
of
a
departure
from
instruction
,
or
in
extraordinary
case
essentially
violating
the
principle
of
equity
,
a
disavowal
could
not
have
been
apprehended
in
a
case
where
no
such
notice
or
violation
existed
,
where
no
such
ratification
wa
reserved
,
and
more
especially
where
,
a
is
now
in
proof
,
an
engagement
to
be
executed
without
any
such
ratification
wa
contemplated
by
the
instruction
given
,
and
where
it
had
with
good
faith
been
carried
into
immediate
execution
on
the
part
of
the
united
state
.
these
consideration
not
having
restrained
the
british
government
from
disavowing
the
arrangement
by
virtue
of
which
it
order
in
council
were
to
be
revoked
,
and
the
event
authorizing
the
renewal
of
commercial
intercourse
having
thus
not
taken
place
,
it
necessarily
became
a
question
of
equal
urgency
and
importance
whether
the
act
prohibiting
that
intercourse
wa
not
to
be
considered
a
remaining
in
legal
force
.
this
question
being
,
after
due
deliberation
,
determined
in
the
affirmative
,
a
proclamation
to
that
effect
wa
issued
.
it
could
not
but
happen
,
however
,
that
a
return
to
this
state
of
thing
from
that
which
had
followed
an
execution
of
the
arrangement
by
the
united
state
would
involve
difficulty
.
with
a
view
to
diminish
these
a
much
a
possible
,
the
instruction
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
now
laid
before
you
were
transmitted
to
the
collector
of
the
several
port
.
if
in
permitting
british
vessel
to
depart
without
giving
bond
not
to
proceed
to
their
own
port
it
should
appear
that
the
tenor
of
legal
authority
ha
not
been
strictly
pursued
,
it
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
anxious
desire
which
wa
felt
that
no
individual
should
be
injured
by
so
unforeseen
an
occurrence
;
and
i
rely
on
the
regard
of
congress
for
the
equitable
interest
of
our
own
citizen
to
adopt
whatever
further
provision
may
be
found
requisite
for
a
general
remission
of
penalty
involuntarily
incurred
.
the
recall
of
the
disavowed
minister
having
been
followed
by
the
appointment
of
a
successor
,
hope
were
indulged
that
the
new
mission
would
contribute
to
alleviate
the
disappointment
which
had
been
produced
,
and
to
remove
the
cause
which
had
so
long
embarrassed
the
good
understanding
of
the
two
nation
.
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
it
would
at
least
be
charged
with
conciliatory
explanation
of
the
step
which
had
been
taken
and
with
proposal
to
be
substituted
for
the
rejected
arrangement
.
reasonable
and
universal
a
this
expectation
wa
,
it
also
ha
not
been
fulfilled
.
from
the
first
official
disclosure
of
the
new
minister
it
wa
found
that
he
had
received
no
authority
to
enter
into
explanation
relative
to
either
branch
of
the
arrangement
disavowed
nor
any
authority
to
substitute
proposal
a
to
that
branch
which
concerned
the
british
order
in
council
,
and
,
finally
,
that
his
proposal
wrt
the
other
branch
,
the
attack
on
the
frigate
chesapeake
,
were
founded
on
a
presumption
repeatedly
declared
to
be
inadmissible
by
the
united
state
,
that
the
first
step
toward
adjustment
wa
due
from
them
,
the
proposal
at
the
same
time
omitting
even
a
reference
to
the
officer
answerable
for
the
murderous
aggression
,
and
asserting
a
claim
not
le
contrary
to
the
british
law
and
british
practice
than
to
the
principle
and
obligation
of
the
united
state
.
the
correspondence
between
the
department
of
state
and
this
minister
will
show
how
unessentially
the
feature
presented
in
it
commencement
have
been
varied
in
it
progress
.
it
will
sow
also
that
,
forgetting
the
respect
due
to
all
government
,
he
did
not
refrain
from
imputation
on
this
,
which
required
that
no
further
communication
should
be
received
from
him
.
the
necessity
of
this
step
will
be
made
known
to
his
britannic
majesty
through
the
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
state
in
london
;
and
it
would
indicate
a
want
of
the
confidence
due
to
a
government
which
so
well
understands
and
exacts
what
becomes
foreign
minister
near
it
not
to
infer
that
the
misconduct
of
it
own
representative
will
be
viewed
in
the
same
light
in
which
it
ha
been
regarded
here
.
the
british
government
will
learn
at
the
same
time
that
a
ready
attention
will
be
given
to
communication
through
any
channel
which
may
be
substituted
.
it
will
be
happy
if
the
change
in
this
respect
should
be
accompanied
by
a
favorable
revision
of
the
unfriendly
policy
which
ha
been
so
long
pursued
toward
the
united
state
.
with
france
,
the
other
belligerent
,
whose
trespass
on
our
commercial
right
have
long
been
the
subject
of
our
just
remonstrance
,
the
posture
of
our
relation
doe
not
correspond
with
the
measure
taken
on
the
part
of
the
united
state
to
effect
a
favorable
change
.
the
result
of
the
several
communication
made
to
her
government
,
in
pursuance
of
the
authority
vested
by
congress
in
the
executive
,
is
contained
in
the
correspondence
of
our
minister
at
paris
now
laid
before
you
.
by
some
of
the
other
belligerent
,
although
professing
just
and
amicable
disposition
,
injury
materially
affecting
our
commerce
have
not
been
duly
controlled
or
repressed
.
in
these
case
the
interposition
deemed
proper
on
our
part
have
not
been
omitted
.
but
it
well
deserves
the
consideration
of
the
legislature
how
far
both
the
safety
and
the
honor
of
the
american
flag
may
be
consulted
,
by
adequate
provision
against
that
collusive
prostitution
of
it
by
individual
unworthy
of
the
american
name
which
ha
so
much
flavored
the
real
or
pretended
suspicion
under
which
the
honest
commerce
of
their
fellow
citizen
ha
suffered
.
in
relation
to
the
power
on
the
coast
of
barbary
,
nothing
ha
occurred
which
is
not
of
a
nature
rather
to
inspire
confidence
than
distrust
a
to
the
continuance
of
the
existing
amity
.
with
our
indian
neighbor
,
the
just
and
benevolent
system
continued
toward
them
ha
also
preserved
peace
,
and
is
more
and
more
advancing
habit
favorable
to
their
civilization
and
happiness
.
from
a
statement
which
will
be
made
by
the
secretary
of
war
it
will
be
seen
that
the
fortification
on
our
maritime
frontier
are
in
many
of
the
port
completed
,
affording
the
defense
which
wa
contemplated
,
and
that
a
further
time
will
be
required
to
render
complete
the
work
in
the
harbor
of
new
york
and
in
some
other
place
.
by
the
enlargement
of
the
work
and
the
employment
of
a
greater
number
of
hand
at
the
public
armory
the
supply
of
small
arm
of
an
improving
quality
appears
to
be
annually
increasing
at
a
rate
that
,
with
those
made
on
private
contract
,
may
be
expected
to
go
far
toward
providing
for
the
public
exigency
.
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
equipment
of
our
vessel
of
war
having
been
fully
carried
into
execution
,
i
refer
to
the
statement
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
the
information
which
may
be
proper
on
that
subject
.
to
that
statement
is
added
a
view
of
the
transfer
of
appropriation
authorized
by
the
act
of
the
session
preceding
the
last
and
of
the
ground
on
which
the
transfer
were
made
.
whatever
may
be
the
course
of
your
deliberation
on
the
subject
of
our
military
establishment
,
i
should
fail
in
my
duty
in
not
recommending
to
your
serious
attention
the
importance
of
giving
to
our
militia
,
the
great
bulwark
of
our
security
and
resource
of
our
power
,
an
organization
best
adapted
to
eventual
situation
for
which
the
united
state
ought
to
be
prepared
.
the
sum
which
had
been
previously
accumulated
in
the
treasury
,
together
with
the
receipt
during
the
year
ending
on
the
30th
of
september
last
(
and
amounting
to
more
than
$
9m
)
,
have
enabled
u
to
fulfill
all
our
engagement
and
to
defray
the
current
expense
of
government
without
recurring
to
any
loan
.
but
the
insecurity
of
our
commerce
and
the
consequent
diminution
of
the
public
revenue
will
probably
produce
a
deficiency
in
the
receipt
of
the
ensuing
year
,
for
which
and
for
other
detail
i
refer
to
the
statement
which
will
be
transmitted
from
the
treasury
.
in
the
state
which
ha
been
presented
of
our
affair
with
the
great
party
to
a
disastrous
and
protracted
war
,
carried
on
in
a
mode
equally
injurious
and
unjust
to
the
united
state
a
a
neutral
nation
,
the
wisdom
of
the
national
legislature
will
be
again
summoned
to
the
important
decision
on
the
alternative
before
them
.
that
these
will
be
met
in
a
spirit
worthy
the
council
of
a
nation
conscious
both
of
it
rectitude
and
of
it
right
,
and
careful
a
well
of
it
honor
a
of
it
peace
,
i
have
an
entire
confidence
;
and
that
the
result
will
be
stamped
by
a
unanimity
becoming
the
occasion
,
and
be
supported
by
every
portion
of
our
citizen
with
a
patriotism
enlightened
and
invigorated
by
experience
,
ought
a
little
to
be
doubted
.
in
the
midst
of
the
wrong
and
vexation
experienced
from
external
cause
there
is
much
room
for
congratulation
on
the
prosperity
and
happiness
flowing
from
our
situation
at
home
.
the
blessing
of
health
ha
never
been
more
universal
.
the
fruit
of
the
season
,
though
in
particular
article
and
district
short
of
their
usual
redundancy
,
are
more
than
sufficient
for
our
want
and
our
comfort
.
the
face
of
our
country
every
present
evidence
of
laudable
enterprise
,
of
extensive
capital
,
and
of
durable
improvement
.
in
a
cultivation
of
the
material
and
the
extension
of
useful
manufacture
,
more
especially
in
the
general
application
to
household
fabric
,
we
behold
a
rapid
diminution
of
our
dependence
on
foreign
supply
.
nor
is
it
unworthy
of
reflection
that
this
revolution
in
our
pursuit
and
habit
is
in
no
slight
degree
a
consequence
of
those
impolitic
and
arbitrary
edict
by
which
the
contending
nation
,
in
endeavoring
each
of
them
to
obstruct
our
trade
with
the
other
,
have
so
far
abridged
our
mean
of
procuring
the
production
and
manufacture
of
which
our
own
are
now
taking
the
place
.
recollecting
always
that
for
every
advantage
which
may
contribute
to
distinguish
our
lot
from
that
to
which
others
are
doomed
by
the
unhappy
spirit
of
the
time
we
are
indebted
to
that
divine
providence
whose
goodness
ha
been
so
remarkably
extended
to
this
rising
nation
,
it
becomes
u
to
cherish
a
devout
gratitude
,
and
to
implore
from
the
same
omnipotent
source
a
blessing
on
the
consultation
and
measure
about
to
be
undertaken
for
the
welfare
of
our
beloved
country
.
