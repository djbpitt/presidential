.
the
recent
accession
of
the

state
of

carolina
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
(
of
which
official
information
ha
been
received
)
,
the
rising
credit
and
respectability
of
our
country
,
the
general
and
increasing
good
will
toward
the
government
of
the

,
and
the
concord
,
peace
,
and

with

in

degree
to
our

prosperity
.
in
resuming
your
consultation
for
the
general
good
you
can
not
but
derive
encouragement
from
the
reflection
that
the
measure
of
the
last
session
have
been
a
satisfactory
to
your
constituent
a
the
novelty
and
difficulty
of
the
work
allowed
you
to
hope
.
still
further
to
realize
their
expectation
and
to
secure
the
blessing
which
a
gracious
providence
ha
placed
within
our
reach
will
in
the
course
of
the
present
important
session
call
for
the
cool
and
deliberate
exertion
of
your
patriotism
,
firmness
,
and
wisdom
.
among
the
many
interesting
object
which
will
engage
your
attention
that
of
providing
for
the
common
defense
will
merit
particular
regard
.
to
be
prepared
for
war
is
one
of
the
most
effectual
mean
of
preserving
peace
.
a
free
people
ought
not
only
to
be
armed
,
but
disciplined
;
to
which
end
a
uniform
and
well-digested
plan
is
requisite
;
and
their
safety
and
interest
require
that
they
should
promote
such
manufactory
a
tend
to
render
them
independent
of
others
for
essential
,
particularly
military
,
supply
.
the
proper
establishment
of
the
troop
which
may
be
deemed
indispensable
will
be
entitled
to
mature
consideration
.
in
the
arrangement
which
may
be
made
respecting
it
it
will
be
of
importance
to
conciliate
the
comfortable
support
of
the
officer
and
soldier
with
a
due
regard
to
economy
.
there
wa
reason
to
hope
that
the
pacific
measure
adopted
with
regard
to
certain
hostile
tribe
of
indian
would
have
relieved
the
inhabitant
of
our
southern
and
western
frontier
from
their
depredation
,
but
you
will
perceive
from
the
information
contained
in
the
paper
which
i
shall
direct
to
be
laid
before
you
(
comprehending
a
communication
from
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
)
that
we
ought
to
be
prepared
to
afford
protection
to
those
part
of
the
union
,
and
,
if
necessary
,
to
punish
aggressor
.
the
interest
of
the
united
state
require
that
our
intercourse
with
other
nation
should
be
facilitated
by
such
provision
a
will
enable
me
to
fulfill
my
duty
in
that
respect
in
the
manner
which
circumstance
may
render
most
conducive
to
the
public
good
,
and
to
this
end
that
the
compensation
to
be
made
to
the
person
who
may
be
employed
should
,
according
to
the
nature
of
their
appointment
,
be
defined
by
law
,
and
a
competent
fund
designated
for
defraying
the
expense
incident
to
the
conduct
of
foreign
affair
.
various
consideration
also
render
it
expedient
that
the
term
on
which
foreigner
may
be
admitted
to
the
right
of
citizen
should
be
speedily
ascertained
by
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization
.
uniformity
in
the
currency
,
weight
,
and
measure
of
the
united
state
is
an
object
of
great
importance
,
and
will
,
i
am
persuaded
,
be
duly
attended
to
.
the
advancement
of
agriculture
,
commerce
,
and
manufacture
by
all
proper
mean
will
not
,
i
trust
,
need
recommendation
;
but
i
can
not
forbear
intimating
to
you
the
expediency
of
giving
effectual
encouragement
a
well
to
the
introduction
of
new
and
useful
invention
from
abroad
a
to
the
exertion
of
skill
and
genius
in
producing
them
at
home
,
and
of
facilitating
the
intercourse
between
the
distant
part
of
our
country
by
a
due
attention
to
the
post-office
and
post-roads
.
nor
am
i
le
persuaded
that
you
will
agree
with
me
in
opinion
that
there
is
nothing
which
can
better
deserve
your
patronage
than
the
promotion
of
science
and
literature
.
knowledge
is
in
every
country
the
surest
basis
of
public
happiness
.
in
one
in
which
the
measure
of
government
receive
their
impression
so
immediately
from
the
sense
of
the
community
a
in
ours
it
is
proportionably
essential
.
to
the
security
of
a
free
constitution
it
contributes
in
various
way
-
by
convincing
those
who
are
intrusted
with
the
public
administration
that
every
valuable
end
of
government
is
best
answered
by
the
enlightened
confidence
of
the
people
,
and
by
teaching
the
people
themselves
to
know
and
to
value
their
own
right
;
to
discern
and
provide
against
invasion
of
them
;
to
distinguish
between
oppression
and
the
necessary
exercise
of
lawful
authority
;
between
burthen
proceeding
from
a
disregard
to
their
convenience
and
those
resulting
from
the
inevitable
exigency
of
society
;
to
discriminate
the
spirit
of
liberty
from
that
of
licentiousness
-
cherishing
the
first
,
avoiding
the
last
-
and
uniting
a
speedy
but
temperate
vigilance
against
encroachment
,
with
an
inviolable
respect
to
the
law
.
whether
this
desirable
object
will
be
best
promoted
by
affording
aid
to
seminary
of
learning
already
established
,
by
the
institution
of
a
national
university
,
or
by
any
other
expedient
will
be
well
worthy
of
a
place
in
the
deliberation
of
the
legislature
.
gentleman
of
the
house
of
representative
:
i
saw
with
peculiar
pleasure
at
the
close
of
the
last
session
the
resolution
entered
into
by
you
expressive
of
your
opinion
that
an
adequate
provision
for
the
support
of
the
public
credit
is
a
matter
of
high
importance
to
the
national
honor
and
prosperity
.
in
this
sentiment
i
entirely
concur
;
and
to
a
perfect
confidence
in
your
best
endeavor
to
devise
such
a
provision
a
will
be
truly
with
the
end
i
add
an
equal
reliance
on
the
cheerful
cooperation
of
the
other
branch
of
the
legislature
.
it
would
be
superfluous
to
specify
inducement
to
a
measure
in
which
the
character
and
interest
of
the
united
state
are
so
obviously
so
deeply
concerned
,
and
which
ha
received
so
explicit
a
sanction
from
your
declaration
.
gentleman
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representative
:
i
have
directed
the
proper
officer
to
lay
before
you
,
respectively
,
such
paper
and
estimate
a
regard
the
affair
particularly
recommended
to
your
consideration
,
and
necessary
to
convey
to
you
that
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
which
it
is
my
duty
to
afford
.
the
welfare
of
our
country
is
the
great
object
to
which
our
care
and
effort
ought
to
be
directed
,
and
i
shall
derive
great
satisfaction
from
a
cooperation
with
you
in
the
pleasing
though
arduous
task
of
insuring
to
our
fellow
citizen
the
blessing
which
they
have
a
right
to
expect
from
a
free
,
efficient
,
and
equal
government
.
