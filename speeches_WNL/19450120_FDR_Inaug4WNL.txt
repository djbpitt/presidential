mr.
chief
justice
,
mr.
vice
president
,
my
friend
:
you
will
understand
and
,
i
believe
,
agree
with
my
wish
that
the
form
of
this
inauguration
be
simple
and
it
word
brief
.
we
american
of
today
,
together
with
our
ally
,
are
passing
through
a
period
of
supreme
test
.
it
is
a
test
of
our
courage—of
our
resolve—of
our
wisdom—of
our
essential
democracy
.
if
we
meet
that
test—successfully
and
honorably—we
shall
perform
a
service
of
historic
importance
which
men
and
woman
and
child
will
honor
throughout
all
time
.
a
i
stand
here
today
,
having
taken
the
solemn
oath
of
office
in
the
presence
of
my
fellow
countrymen—in
the
presence
of
our
god—i
know
that
it
is
america
's
purpose
that
we
shall
not
fail
.
in
the
day
and
the
year
that
are
to
come
,
we
shall
work
for
ajust
and
honorable
peace
,
a
durable
peace
,
a
today
we
work
and
fight
for
total
victory
in
war
.
we
can
and
we
will
achieve
such
a
peace
.
we
shall
strive
for
perfection
.
we
shall
not
achieve
it
immediately—but
we
still
shall
strive
.
we
may
make
mistakes—but
they
must
never
be
mistake
which
result
from
faintness
of
heart
or
abandonment
of
moral
principle
.
i
remember
that
my
old
schoolmaster
,
dr.
peabody
,
said
in
day
that
seemed
to
u
then
to
be
secure
and
untroubled
,
``
thing
in
life
will
not
always
run
smoothly
.
sometimes
we
will
be
rising
toward
the
heights—then
all
will
seem
to
reverse
itself
and
start
downward
.
the
great
fact
to
remember
is
that
the
trend
of
civilization
itself
is
forever
upward
;
that
a
line
drawn
through
the
middle
of
the
peak
and
the
valley
of
the
century
always
ha
an
upward
trend
.
''
our
constitution
of
1787
wa
not
a
perfect
instrument
;
it
is
not
perfect
yet
.
but
it
provided
a
firm
base
upon
which
all
manner
of
men
,
of
all
race
and
color
and
creed
,
could
build
our
solid
structure
of
democracy
.
today
,
in
this
year
of
war
,
1945
,
we
have
learned
lessons—at
a
fearful
cost—and
we
shall
profit
by
them
.
we
have
learned
that
we
can
not
live
alone
,
at
peace
;
that
our
own
well-being
is
dependent
on
the
well-being
of
other
nation
,
far
away
.
we
have
learned
that
we
must
live
a
men
and
not
a
ostrich
,
nor
a
dog
in
the
manger
.
we
have
learned
to
be
citizen
of
the
world
,
member
of
the
human
community
.
we
have
learned
the
simple
truth
,
a
emerson
said
,
that
,
``
the
only
way
to
have
a
friend
is
to
be
one
.
''
we
can
gain
no
lasting
peace
if
we
approach
it
with
suspicion
and
mistrust
or
with
fear
.
we
can
gain
it
only
if
we
proceed
with
the
understanding
and
the
confidence
and
the
courage
which
flow
from
conviction
.
the
almighty
god
ha
blessed
our
land
in
many
way
.
he
ha
given
our
people
stout
heart
and
strong
arm
with
which
to
strike
mighty
blow
for
freedom
and
truth
.
he
ha
given
to
our
country
a
faith
which
ha
become
the
hope
of
all
people
in
an
anguished
world
.
so
we
pray
to
him
now
for
the
vision
to
see
our
way
clearly
to
see
the
way
that
lead
to
a
better
life
for
ourselves
and
for
all
our
fellow
men—and
to
the
achievement
of
his
will
to
peace
on
earth
.
