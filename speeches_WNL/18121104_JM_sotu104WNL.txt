fellow-citizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representative
:
on
our
present
meeting
it
is
my
first
duty
to
invite
your
attention
to
the
providential
favor
which
our
country
ha
experienced
in
the
unusual
degree
of
health
dispensed
to
it
inhabitant
,
and
in
the
rich
abundance
with
which
the
earth
ha
rewarded
the
labor
bestowed
on
it
.
in
the
successful
cultivation
of
other
branch
of
industry
,
and
in
the
progress
of
general
improvement
favorable
to
the
national
prosperity
,
there
is
just
occasion
also
for
our
mutual
congratulation
and
thankfulness
.
with
these
blessing
are
necessarily
mingled
the
pressure
and
vicissitude
incident
to
the
state
of
war
into
which
the
united
state
have
been
forced
by
the
perseverance
of
a
foreign
power
in
it
system
of
injustice
and
aggression
.
previous
to
it
declaration
it
wa
deemed
proper
,
a
a
measure
of
precaution
and
forecast
,
that
a
considerable
force
should
be
placed
in
the
michigan
territory
with
a
general
view
to
it
security
,
and
,
in
the
event
of
war
,
to
such
operation
in
the
uppermost
canada
a
would
intercept
the
hostile
influence
of
great
britain
over
the
savage
,
obtain
the
command
of
the
lake
on
which
that
part
of
canada
border
,
and
maintain
cooperating
relation
with
such
force
a
might
be
most
conveniently
employed
against
other
part
.
brigadier-general
hull
wa
charged
with
this
provisional
service
,
having
under
his
command
a
body
of
troop
composed
of
regular
and
of
volunteer
from
the
state
of
ohio
.
having
reached
his
destination
after
his
knowledge
of
the
war
,
and
possessing
discretionary
authority
to
act
offensively
,
he
passed
into
the
neighboring
territory
of
the
enemy
with
a
prospect
of
easy
and
victorious
progress
.
the
expedition
,
nevertheless
,
terminated
unfortunately
,
not
only
in
a
retreat
to
the
town
and
fort
of
detroit
,
but
in
the
surrender
of
both
and
of
the
gallant
corp
commanded
by
that
officer
.
the
cause
of
this
painful
reverse
will
be
investigated
by
a
military
tribunal
.
a
distinguishing
feature
in
the
operation
which
preceded
and
followed
this
adverse
event
is
the
use
made
by
the
enemy
of
the
merciless
savage
under
their
influence
.
whilst
the
benevolent
policy
of
the
united
state
invariably
recommended
peace
and
promoted
civilization
among
that
wretched
portion
of
the
human
race
,
and
wa
making
exertion
to
dissuade
them
from
taking
either
side
in
the
war
,
the
enemy
ha
not
scrupled
to
call
to
his
aid
their
ruthless
ferocity
,
armed
with
the
horror
of
those
instrument
of
carnage
and
torture
which
are
known
to
spare
neither
age
nor
sex
.
in
this
outrage
against
the
law
of
honorable
war
and
against
the
feeling
sacred
to
humanity
the
british
commander
can
not
resort
to
a
plea
of
retaliation
,
for
it
is
committed
in
the
face
of
our
example
.
they
can
not
mitigate
it
by
calling
it
a
self-defense
against
men
in
arm
,
for
it
embrace
the
most
shocking
butchery
of
defenseless
family
.
nor
can
it
be
pretended
that
they
are
not
answerable
for
the
atrocity
perpetrated
,
since
the
savage
are
employed
with
a
knowledge
,
and
even
with
menace
,
that
their
fury
could
not
be
controlled
.
such
is
the
spectacle
which
the
deputed
authority
of
a
nation
boasting
it
religion
and
morality
have
not
been
restrained
from
presenting
to
an
enlightened
age
.
the
misfortune
at
detroit
wa
not
,
however
,
without
a
consoling
effect
.
it
wa
followed
by
signal
proof
that
the
national
spirit
rise
according
to
the
pressure
on
it
.
the
loss
of
an
important
post
and
of
the
brave
men
surrendered
with
it
inspired
everywhere
new
ardor
and
determination
.
in
the
state
and
district
least
remote
it
wa
no
sooner
known
than
every
citizen
wa
ready
to
fly
with
his
arm
at
once
to
protect
his
brother
against
the
blood-thirsty
savage
let
loose
by
the
enemy
on
an
extensive
frontier
,
and
to
convert
a
partial
calamity
into
a
source
of
invigorated
effort
.
this
patriotic
zeal
,
which
it
wa
necessary
rather
to
limit
than
excite
,
ha
embodied
an
ample
force
from
the
state
of
kentucky
and
ohio
and
from
part
of
pennsylvania
and
virginia
.
it
is
placed
,
with
the
addition
of
a
few
regular
,
under
the
command
of
brigadier-general
harrison
,
who
posse
the
entire
confidence
of
his
fellow
soldier
,
among
whom
are
citizen
,
some
of
them
volunteer
in
the
rank
,
not
le
distinguished
by
their
political
station
than
by
their
personal
merit
.
the
greater
portion
of
this
force
is
proceeding
in
relieving
an
important
frontier
post
,
and
in
several
incidental
operation
against
hostile
tribe
of
savage
,
rendered
indispensable
by
the
subserviency
into
which
they
had
been
seduced
by
the
enemy
-
a
seduction
the
more
cruel
a
it
could
not
fail
to
impose
a
necessity
of
precautionary
severity
against
those
who
yielded
to
it
.
at
a
recent
date
an
attack
wa
made
on
a
post
of
the
enemy
near
niagara
by
a
detachment
of
the
regular
and
other
force
under
the
command
of
major-general
van
rensselaer
,
of
the
militia
of
the
state
of
new
york
.
the
attack
,
it
appears
,
wa
ordered
in
compliance
with
the
ardor
of
the
troop
,
who
executed
it
with
distinguished
gallantry
,
and
were
for
a
time
victorious
;
but
not
receiving
the
expected
support
,
they
were
compelled
to
yield
to
reenforcement
of
british
regular
and
savage
.
our
loss
ha
been
considerable
,
and
is
deeply
to
be
lamented
.
that
of
the
enemy
,
le
ascertained
,
will
be
the
more
felt
,
a
it
includes
among
the
killed
the
commanding
general
,
who
wa
also
the
governor
of
the
province
,
and
wa
sustained
by
veteran
troop
from
unexperienced
soldier
,
who
must
daily
improve
in
the
duty
of
the
field
.
our
expectation
of
gaining
the
command
of
the
lake
by
the
invasion
of
canada
from
detroit
having
been
disappointed
,
measure
were
instantly
taken
to
provide
on
them
a
naval
force
superior
to
that
of
the
enemy
.
from
the
talent
and
activity
of
the
officer
charged
with
this
object
everything
that
can
be
done
may
be
expected
.
should
the
present
season
not
admit
of
complete
success
,
the
progress
made
will
insure
for
the
next
a
naval
ascendancy
where
it
is
essential
to
our
permanent
peace
with
and
control
over
the
savage
.
among
the
incident
to
the
measure
of
the
war
i
am
constrained
to
advert
to
the
refusal
of
the
governor
of
maine
and
connecticut
to
furnish
the
required
detachment
of
militia
toward
the
defense
of
the
maritime
frontier
.
the
refusal
wa
founded
on
a
novel
and
unfortunate
exposition
of
the
provision
of
the
constitution
relating
to
the
militia
.
the
correspondence
which
will
be
laid
before
you
contain
the
requisite
information
on
the
subject
.
it
is
obvious
that
if
the
authority
of
the
united
state
to
call
into
service
and
command
the
militia
for
the
public
defense
can
be
thus
frustrated
,
even
in
a
state
of
declared
war
and
of
course
under
apprehension
of
invasion
preceding
war
,
they
are
not
one
nation
for
the
purpose
most
of
all
requiring
it
,
and
that
the
public
safety
may
have
no
other
resource
than
in
those
large
and
permanent
military
establishment
which
are
forbidden
by
the
principle
of
our
free
government
,
and
against
the
necessity
of
which
the
militia
were
meant
to
be
a
constitutional
bulwark
.
on
the
coast
and
on
the
ocean
the
war
ha
been
a
successful
a
circumstance
inseparable
from
it
early
stage
could
promise
.
our
public
ship
and
private
cruiser
,
by
their
activity
,
and
,
where
there
wa
occasion
,
by
their
intrepidity
,
have
made
the
enemy
sensible
of
the
difference
between
a
reciprocity
of
capture
and
the
long
confinement
of
them
to
their
side
.
our
trade
,
with
little
exception
,
ha
safely
reached
our
port
,
having
been
much
favored
in
it
by
the
course
pursued
by
a
squadron
of
our
frigate
under
the
command
of
commodore
rodgers
,
and
in
the
instance
in
which
skill
and
bravery
were
more
particularly
tried
with
those
of
the
enemy
the
american
flag
had
an
auspicious
triumph
.
the
frigate

,
commanded
by
captain
hull
,
after
a
close
and
short
engagement
completely
disabled
and
captured
a
british
frigate
,
gaining
for
that
officer
and
all
on
board
a
praise
which
can
not
be
too
liberally
bestowed
,
not
merely
for
the
victory
actually
achieved
,
but
for
that
prompt
and
cool
exertion
of
commanding
talent
which
,
giving
to
courage
it
highest
character
,
and
to
the
force

effect
,

that

in
a
contest

to
abridge
the
evil
from
which
a
state
of
war
can
not
be
exempt
,
i
lost
no
time
after
it
wa
declared
in
conveying
to
the
british
government
the
term
on
which
it
progress
might
be
arrested
,
without
awaiting
the
delay
of
a
formal
and
final
pacification
,
and
our
charge
'
d'affaires
at
london
wa
at
the
same
time
authorized
to
agree
to
an
armistice

upon
them

affected
the
united
state
,
without
a
revival
of
blockade
violating
acknowledged
rule
,
and
that
there
should
be
an
immediate
discharge
of
american
sea
men
from
british
ship
,
and
a
stop
to
impressment
from
american
ship
,
with
an
understanding
that
an
exclusion
of
the
sea
men
of
each
nation
from
the
ship
of
the

should
be
stipulated
,
and
that
the
armistice
should
be
improved
into
a
definitive
and
comprehensive
adjustment
of
depending
controversy
.
although
a
repeal
of
the
order
susceptible
of
explanation
meeting
the
view
of
this
government
had
taken
place
before
this
pacific
advance
wa
communicated
to
that
of
great
britain
,
the
advance
wa
declined
from
an
avowed
repugnance
to
a
suspension
of
the
practice
of
impressment
during
the
armistice
,
and
without
any
intimation
that
the
arrangement
proposed
wrt
sea
men
would
be
accepted
.
whether
the
subsequent
communication
from
this
government
,
affording
an
occasion
for
reconsidering
the
subject
on
the
part
of
great
britain
,
will
be
viewed
in
a
more
favorable
light
or
received
in
a
more
accommodating
spirit
remains
to
be
known
.
it
would
be
unwise
to
relax
our
measure
in
any
respect
on
a
presumption
of
such
a
result
.
the
document
from
the
department
of
state
which
relate
to
this
subject
will
give
a
view
also
of
the
proposition
for
an
armistice
which
have
been
received
here
,
one
of
them
from
the
authority
at
halifax
and
in
canada
,
the
other
from
the
british
government
itself
through
admiral
warren
,
and
of
the
ground
on
which
neither
of
them
could
be
accepted
.
our
affair
with
france
retain
the
posture
which
they
held
at
my
last
communication
to
you
.
notwithstanding
the
authorized
expectation
of
an
early
a
well
a
favorable
issue
to
the
discussion
on
foot
,
these
have
been
procrastinated
to
the
latest
date
.
the
only
intervening
occurrence
meriting
attention
is
the
promulgation
of
a
french
decree
purporting
to
be
a
definitive
repeal
of
the
berlin
and
milan
decree
.
this
proceeding
,
although
made
the
ground
of
the
repeal
of
the
british
order
in
council
,
is
rendered
by
the
time
and
manner
of
it
liable
to
many
objection
.
the
final
communication
from
our
special
minister
to
denmark
afford
further
proof
of
the
good
effect
of
his
mission
,
and
of
the
amicable
disposition
of
the
danish
government
.
from
russia
we
have
the
satisfaction
to
receive
assurance
of
continued
friendship
,
and
that
it
will
not
be
affected
by
the
rupture
between
the
united
state
and
great
britain

sentiment

to
the

on
the

footing

with

regency

suddenly
and
without
cause

banished

with
all

there

the
transitory
effect
of

despotism

the

act
of

precaution
were
taken
by
the
consul
on
the
latter
supposition
.
the
indian
tribe
not
under
foreign
instigation
remain
at
peace
,
and
receive
the
civilizing
attention
which
have
proved
so
beneficial
to
them
.
with
a
view
to
that
vigorous
prosecution
of
the
war
to
which
our
national
faculty
are
adequate
,
the
attention
of
congress
will
be
particularly
drawn
to
the
insufficiency
of
existing
provision
for
filling
up
the
military
establishment
.
such
is
the
happy
condition
of
our
country
,
arising
from
the
facility
of
subsistence
and
the
high
wage
for
every
specie
of
occupation
,
that
notwithstanding
the
augmented
inducement
provided
at
the
last
session
,
a
partial
success
only
ha
attended
the
recruiting
service
.
the
deficiency
ha
been
necessarily
supplied
during
the
campaign
by
other
than
regular
troop
,
with
all
the
inconvenience
and
expense
incident
to
them
.
the
remedy
lie
in
establishing
more
favorably
for
the
private
soldier
the
proportion
between
his
recompense
and
the
term
of
his
enlistment
,
and
it
is
a
subject
which
can
not
too
soon
or
too
seriously
be
taken
into
consideration
.
the
same
insufficiency
ha
been
experienced
in
the
provision
for
volunteer
made
by
an
act
of
the
last
session
.
the
recompense
for
the
service
required
in
this
case
is
still
le
attractive
than
in
the
other
,
and
although
patriotism
alone
ha
sent
into
the
field
some
valuable
corp
of
that
description
,
those
alone
who
can
afford
the
sacrifice
can
be
reasonably
expected
to
yield
to
that
impulse
.
it
will
merit
consideration
also
whether
a
auxiliary
to
the
security
of
our
frontier
corp
may
not
be
advantageously
organized
with
a
restriction
of
their
service
to
particular
district
convenient
to
them
,
and
whether
the
local
and
occasional
service
of
mariner
and
others
in
the
sea
port
town
under
a
similar
organization
would
not
be
a
provident
addition
to
the
mean
of
their
defense
.
i
recommend
a
provision
for
an
increase
of
the
general
officer
of
the
army
,
the
deficiency
of
which
ha
been
illustrated
by
the
#
and
distance
of
separate
command
which
the
course
of
the
war
and
the
advantage
of
the
service
have
required
.
and
i
can
not
press
too
strongly
on
the
earliest
attention
of
the
legislature
the
importance
of
the
reorganization
of
the
staff
establishment
with
a
view
to
render
more
distinct
and
definite
the
relation
and
responsibility
of

equally
inculcated
by
the
example
of

by
the
experience
of

own
.

revision
of

the

is
it
le
so
that
penal
enactment
should
be
provided

case
of
corrupt
and

intercourse
with

not
amounting

a

in

with
british

under
an
erroneous
impression
that
the
non-importation
act
would
immediately
cease
to
operate
,
and
have
arrived

it
did
not
appear

to
exercise
on

case
of

magnitude
the
power
vested

the

mitigate

on

such
provision

year

exceeded

16.5m

have
been
sufficient
to
defray

reimbursement
of

3m

the
situation
of
our
country
,
fellow
citizen
,
is
not
without
it
difficulty
,
though
it
abounds
in
animating
consideration
,
of
which
the
view
here
presented
of
our
pecuniary
resource
is
an
example
.
with
more
than
one
nation
we
have
serious
and
unsettled
controversy
,
and
with
one
,
powerful
in
the
mean
and
habit
of
war
,
we
are
at
war
.
the
spirit
and
strength
of
the
nation
are
nevertheless
equal
to
the
support
of
all
it
right
,
and
to
carry
it
through
all
it
trial
.
they
can
be
met
in
that
confidence
.
above
all
,
we
have
the
inestimable
consolation
of
knowing
that
the
war
in
which
we
are
actually
engaged
is
a
war
neither
of
ambition
nor
of
vain
glory
;
that
it
is
waged
not
in
violation
of
the
right
of
others
,
but
in
the
maintenance
of
our
own
;
that
it
wa
preceded
by
a
patience
without
example
under
wrong
accumulating
without
end
,
and
that
it
wa
finally
not
declared
until
every
hope
of
averting
it
wa
extinguished
by
the
transfer
of
the
british
scepter
into
new
hand
clinging
to
former
council
,
and
until
declaration
were
reiterated
to
the
last
hour
,
through
the
british
envoy
here
,
that
the
hostile
edict
against
our
commercial
right
and
our
maritime
independence
would
not
be
revoked
;
nay
,
that
they
could
not
be
revoked
without
violating
the
obligation
of
great
britain
to
other
power
,
a
well
a
to
her
own
interest
.
to
have
shrunk
under
such
circumstance
from
manly
resistance
would
have
been
a
degradation
blasting
our
best
and
proudest
hope
;
it
would
have
struck
u
from
the
high
rank
where
the
virtuous
struggle
of
our
father
had
placed
u
,
and
have
betrayed
the
magnificent
legacy
which
we
hold
in
trust
for
future
generation
.
it
would
have
acknowledged
that
on
the
element
which
form
three-fourth
of
the
globe
we
inhabit
,
and
where
all
independent
nation
have
equal
and
common
right
,
the
american
people
were
not
an
independent
people
,
but
colonist
and
vassal
.
it
wa
at
this
moment
and
with
such
an
alternative
that
war
wa
chosen
.
the
nation
felt
the
necessity
of
it
,
and
called
for
it
.
the
appeal
wa
accordingly
made
,
in
a
just
cause
,
to
the
just
and
all-powerful
being
who
hold
in
his
hand
the
chain
of
event
and
the
destiny
of
nation
.
it
remains
only
that
,
faithful
to
ourselves
,
entangled
in
no
connection
with
the
view
of
other
power
,
and
ever
ready
to
accept
peace
from
the
hand
of
justice
,
we
prosecute
the
war
with
united
counsel
and
with
the
ample
faculty
of
the
nation
,
until
peace
be
so
obtained
and
a
the
only
mean
under
the
divine
blessing
of
speedily
obtaining
it
.
