to
the
congress
:
in
considering
the
state
of
the
union
,
the
war
and
the
peace
that
is
to
follow
are
naturally
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
all
of
u
.
this
war
must
be
waged—it
is
being
waged—with
the
greatest
and
most
persistent
intensity
.
everything
we
are
and
have
is
at
stake
.
everything
we
are
and
have
will
be
given
.
american
men
,
fighting
far
from
home
,
have
already
won
victory
which
the
world
will
never
forget
.
we
have
no
question
of
the
ultimate
victory
.
we
have
no
question
of
the
cost
.
our
loss
will
be
heavy
.
we
and
our
ally
will
go
on
fighting
together
to
ultimate
total
victory
.
we
have
seen
a
year
marked
,
on
the
whole
,
by
substantial
progress
toward
victory
,
even
though
the
year
ended
with
a
setback
for
our
arm
,
when
the
german
launched
a
ferocious
counter-attack
into
luxembourg
and
belgium
with
the
obvious
objective
of
cutting
our
line
in
the
center
.
our
men
have
fought
with
indescribable
and
unforgettable
gallantry
under
most
difficult
condition
,
and
our
german
enemy
have
sustained
considerable
loss
while
failing
to
obtain
their
objective
.
the
high
tide
of
this
german
effort
wa
reached
two
day
after
christmas
.
since
then
we
have
reassumed
the
offensive
,
rescued
the
isolated
garrison
at
bastogne
,
and
forced
a
german
withdrawal
along
the
whole
line
of
the
salient
.
the
speed
with
which
we
recovered
from
this
savage
attack
wa
largely
possible
because
we
have
one
supreme
commander
in
complete
control
of
all
the
allied
army
in
france
.
general
eisenhower
ha
faced
this
period
of
trial
with
admirable
calm
and
resolution
and
with
steadily
increasing
success
.
he
ha
my
complete
confidence
.
further
desperate
attempt
may
well
be
made
to
break
our
line
,
to
slow
our
progress
.
we
must
never
make
the
mistake
of
assuming
that
the
german
are
beaten
until
the
last
nazi
ha
surrendered
.
and
i
would
express
another
most
serious
warning
against
the
poisonous
effect
of
enemy
propaganda
.
the
wedge
that
the
german
attempted
to
drive
in
western
europe
wa
le
dangerous
in
actual
term
of
winning
the
war
than
the
wedge
which
they
are
continually
attempting
to
drive
between
ourselves
and
our
ally
.
every
little
rumor
which
is
intended
to
weaken
our
faith
in
our
ally
is
like
an
actual
enemy
agent
in
our
midst-
seeking
to
sabotage
our
war
effort
.
there
are
,
here
and
there
,
evil
and
baseless
rumor
against
the
russians-
rumor
against
the
british—rumors
against
our
own
american
commander
in
the
field
.
when
you
examine
these
rumor
closely
,
you
will
observe
that
every
one
of
them
bear
the
same
trade-mark—
''
made
in
germany
.
''
we
must
resist
this
divisive
propaganda—we
must
destroy
it
-with
the
same
strength
and
the
same
determination
that
our
fighting
men
are
displaying
a
they
resist
and
destroy
the
panzer
division
.
in
europe
,
we
shall
resume
the
attack
and—despite
temporary
setback
here
or
there-
we
shall
continue
the
attack
relentlessly
until
germany
is
completely
defeated
.
it
is
appropriate
at
this
time
to
review
the
basic
strategy
which
ha
guided
u
through
three
year
of
war
,
and
which
will
lead
,
eventually
,
to
total
victory
.
the
tremendous
effort
of
the
first
year
of
this
war
wa
directed
toward
the
concentration
of
men
and
supply
in
the
various
theater
of
action
at
the
point
where
they
could
hurt
our
enemy
most
.
it
wa
an
effort—in
the
language
of
the
military
men—of
deployment
of
our
force
.
many
battles—essential
battles—were
fought
;
many
victories—vital
victories—were
won
.
but
these
battle
and
these
victory
were
fought
and
won
to
hold
back
the
attacking
enemy
,
and
to
put
u
in
position
from
which
we
and
our
ally
could
deliver
the
final
,
decisive
blow
.
in
the
beginning
our
most
important
military
task
wa
to
prevent
our
enemies—the
strongest
and
most
violently
aggressive
power
that
ever
have
threatened
civilization—from
winning
decisive
victory
.
but
even
while
we
were
conducting
defensive
,
delaying
action
,
we
were
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
we
could
wrest
the
initiative
from
our
enemy
and
place
our
superior
resource
of
men
and
material
into
direct
competition
with
them
.
it
wa
plain
then
that
the
defeat
of
either
enemy
would
require
the
massing
of
overwhelming
forces-
ground
,
sea
,
and
air-
in
position
from
which
we
and
our
ally
could
strike
directly
against
the
enemy
homeland
and
destroy
the
nazi
and
japanese
war
machine
.
in
the
case
of
japan
,
we
had
to
await
the
completion
of
extensive
preliminary
operations—operations
designed
to
establish
secure
supply
line
through
the
japanese
outer-zone
defense
.
this
called
for
overwhelming
sea
power
and
air
power—supported
by
ground
force
strategically
employed
against
isolated
outpost
garrison
.
always—from
the
very
day
we
were
attacked-
it
wa
right
militarily
a
well
a
morally
to
reject
the
argument
of
those
shortsighted
people
who
would
have
had
u
throw
britain
and
russia
to
the
nazi
wolf
and
concentrate
against
the
japanese
.
such
people
urged
that
we
fight
a
purely
defensive
war
against
japan
while
allowing
the
domination
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
by
nazism
and
fascism
.
in
the
european
theater
the
necessary
base
for
the
massing
of
ground
and
air
power
against
germany
were
already
available
in
great
britain
.
in
the
mediterranean
area
we
could
begin
ground
operation
against
major
element
of
the
german
army
a
rapidly
a
we
could
put
troop
in
the
field
,
first
in
north
africa
and
then
in
italy
.
therefore
,
our
decision
wa
made
to
concentrate
the
bulk
of
our
ground
and
air
force
against
germany
until
her
utter
defeat
.
that
decision
wa
based
on
all
these
factor
;
and
it
wa
also
based
on
the
realization
that
,
of
our
two
enemy
,
germany
would
be
more
able
to
digest
quickly
her
conquest
,
the
more
able
quickly
to
convert
the
manpower
and
resource
of
her
conquered
territory
into
a
war
potential
.
we
had
in
europe
two
active
and
indomitable
allies-
britain
and
the
soviet
union-
and
there
were
also
the
heroic
resistance
movement
in
the
occupied
country
,
constantly
engaging
and
harassing
the
german
.
we
can
not
forget
how
britain
held
the
line
,
alone
,
in
1940
and
1941
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
despite
ferocious
bombardment
from
the
air
,
built
up
a
tremendous
armament
industry
which
enabled
her
to
take
the
offensive
at
el
alamein
in
1942
.
we
can
not
forget
the
heroic
defense
of
moscow
and
leningrad
and
stalingrad
,
or
the
tremendous
russian
offensive
of
1943
and
1944
which
destroyed
formidable
german
army
.
nor
can
we
forget
how
,
for
more
than
seven
long
year
,
the
chinese
people
have
been
sustaining
the
barbarous
attack
of
the
japanese
and
containing
large
enemy
force
on
the
vast
area
of
the
asiatic
mainland
.
in
the
future
we
must
never
forget
the
lesson
that
we
have
learned-
that
we
must
have
friend
who
will
work
with
u
in
peace
a
they
have
fought
at
our
side
in
war
.
a
a
result
of
the
combined
effort
of
the
allied
force
,
great
military
victory
were
achieved
in
1944
:
the
liberation
of
france
,
belgium
,
greece
,
and
part
of
the
netherlands
,
norway
,
poland
,
yugoslavia
,
and
czechoslovakia
;
the
surrender
of
rumania
and
bulgaria
;
the
invasion
of
germany
itself
and
hungary
;
the
steady
march
through
the
pacific
island
to
the
philippine
,
guam
,
and
saipan
;
and
the
beginning
of
a
mighty
air
offensive
against
the
japanese
island
.
now
,
a
this
seventy-ninth
congress
meet
,
we
have
reached
the
most
critical
phase
of
the
war
.
the
greatest
victory
of
the
last
year
wa
,
of
course
,
the
successful
breach
on
june
6
,
1944
,
of
the
german
``
impregnable
''
seawall
of
europe
and
the
victorious
sweep
of
the
allied
force
through
france
and
belgium
and
luxembourg—almost
to
the
rhine
itself
.
the
cross-channel
invasion
of
the
allied
army
wa
the
greatest
amphibious
operation
in
the
history
of
the
world
.
it
overshadowed
all
other
operation
in
this
or
any
other
war
in
it
immensity
.
it
success
is
a
tribute
to
the
fighting
courage
of
the
soldier
who
stormed
the
beaches-
to
the
sailor
and
merchant
seaman
who
put
the
soldier
ashore
and
kept
them
supplied-and
to
the
military
and
naval
leader
who
achieved
a
real
miracle
of
planning
and
execution
.
and
it
is
also
a
tribute
to
the
ability
of
two
nation
,
britain
and
america
,
to
plan
together
,
and
work
together
,
and
fight
together
in
perfect
cooperation
and
perfect
harmony
.
this
cross-channel
invasion
wa
followed
in
august
by
a
second
great
amphibious
operation
,
landing
troop
in
southern
france
.
in
this
,
the
same
cooperation
and
the
same
harmony
existed
between
the
american
,
french
,
and
other
allied
force
based
in
north
africa
and
italy
.
the
success
of
the
two
invasion
is
a
tribute
also
to
the
ability
of
many
men
and
woman
to
maintain
silence
,
when
a
few
careless
word
would
have
imperiled
the
life
of
hundred
of
thousand
,
and
would
have
jeopardized
the
whole
vast
undertaking
.
these
two
great
operation
were
made
possible
by
success
in
the
battle
of
the
atlantic
.
without
this
success
over
german
submarine
,
we
could
not
have
built
up
our
invasion
force
or
air
force
in
great
britain
,
nor
could
we
have
kept
a
steady
stream
of
supply
flowing
to
them
after
they
had
landed
in
france
.
the
nazi
,
however
,
may
succeed
in
improving
their
submarine
and
their
crew
.
they
have
recently
increased
their
u-boat
activity
.
the
battle
of
the
atlantic—like
all
campaign
in
this
war—demands
eternal
vigilance
.
but
the
british
,
canadian
,
and
other
allied
navy
,
together
with
our
own
,
are
constantly
on
the
alert
.
the
tremendous
operation
in
western
europe
have
overshadowed
in
the
public
mind
the
le
spectacular
but
vitally
important
italian
front
.
it
place
in
the
strategic
conduct
of
the
war
in
europe
ha
been
obscured
,
and—by
some
people
unfortunately—underrated
.
it
is
important
that
any
misconception
on
that
score
be
corrected—now
.
what
the
allied
force
in
italy
are
doing
is
a
well-considered
part
in
our
strategy
in
europe
,
now
aimed
at
only
one
objective
—the
total
defeat
of
the
german
.
these
valiant
force
in
italy
are
continuing
to
keep
a
substantial
portion
of
the
german
army
under
constant
pressure—including
some
20
first-line
german
division
and
the
necessary
supply
and
transport
and
replacement
troops—all
of
which
our
enemy
need
so
badly
elsewhere
.
over
very
difficult
terrain
and
through
adverse
weather
condition
,
our
fifth
army
and
the
british
eighth
army—reinforced
by
unit
from
other
united
nation
,
including
a
brave
and
well
equipped
unit
of
the
brazilian
army—have
,
in
the
past
year
,
pushed
north
through
bloody
cassino
and
the
anzio
beachhead
,
and
through
rome
until
now
they
occupy
height
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
po
.
the
greatest
tribute
which
can
be
paid
to
the
courage
and
fighting
ability
of
these
splendid
soldier
in
italy
is
to
point
out
that
although
their
strength
is
about
equal
to
that
of
the
german
they
oppose
,
the
ally
have
been
continuously
on
the
offensive
.
that
pressure
,
that
offensive
,
by
our
troop
in
italy
will
continue
.
the
american
people-
and
every
soldier
now
fighting
in
the
apennines—should
remember
that
the
italian
front
ha
not
lost
any
of
the
importance
which
it
had
in
the
day
when
it
wa
the
only
allied
front
in
europe
.
in
the
pacific
during
the
past
year
,
we
have
conducted
the
fastest-moving
offensive
in
the
history
of
modern
warfare
.
we
have
driven
the
enemy
back
more
than
3,000
mile
across
the
central
pacific
.
a
year
ago
,
our
conquest
of
tarawa
wa
a
little
more
than
a
month
old
.
a
year
ago
,
we
were
preparing
for
our
invasion
of
kwajalein
,
the
second
of
our
great
stride
across
the
central
pacific
to
the
philippine
.
a
year
ago
,
general
macarthur
wa
still
fighting
in
new
guinea
almost
1,500
mile
from
his
present
position
in
the
philippine
island
.
we
now
have
firmly
established
base
in
the
mariana
island
,
from
which
our
super
fortress
bomb
tokyo
itself—and
will
continue
to
blast
japan
in
ever-increasing
number
.
japanese
force
in
the
philippine
have
been
cut
in
two
.
there
is
still
hard
fighting
ahead—costly
fighting
.
but
the
liberation
of
the
philippine
will
mean
that
japan
ha
been
largely
cut
off
from
her
conquest
in
the
east
indie
.
the
landing
of
our
troop
on
leyte
wa
the
largest
amphibious
operation
thus
far
conducted
in
the
pacific
.
moreover
,
these
landing
drew
the
japanese
fleet
into
the
first
great
sea
battle
which
japan
ha
risked
in
almost
two
year
.
not
since
the
night
engagement
around
guadalcanal
in
november-december
,
1942
,
had
our
navy
been
able
to
come
to
grip
with
major
unit
of
the
japanese
fleet
.
we
had
brushed
against
their
fleet
in
the
first
battle
of
the
philippine
sea
in
june
,
1944
,
but
not
until
last
october
were
we
able
really
to
engage
a
major
portion
of
the
japanese
navy
in
actual
combat
.
the
naval
engagement
which
raged
for
three
day
wa
the
heaviest
blow
ever
struck
against
japanese
sea
power
.
a
a
result
of
that
battle
,
much
of
what
is
left
of
the
japanese
fleet
ha
been
driven
behind
the
screen
of
island
that
separate
the
yellow
sea
,
the
china
sea
,
and
the
sea
of
japan
from
the
pacific
.
our
navy
look
forward
to
any
opportunity
which
the
lord
of
the
japanese
navy
will
give
u
to
fight
them
again
.
the
people
of
this
nation
have
a
right
to
be
proud
of
the
courage
and
fighting
ability
of
the
men
in
the
armed
forces—on
all
front
.
they
also
have
a
right
to
be
proud
of
american
leadership
which
ha
guided
their
son
into
battle
.
the
history
of
the
generalship
of
this
war
ha
been
a
history
of
teamwork
and
cooperation
,
of
skill
and
daring
.
let
me
give
you
one
example
out
of
last
year's
operation
in
the
pacific
.
last
september
admiral
halsey
led
american
naval
task
force
into
philippine
water
and
north
to
the
east
china
sea
,
and
struck
heavy
blow
at
japanese
air
and
sea
power
.
at
that
time
it
wa
our
plan
to
approach
the
philippine
by
further
stage
,
taking
island
which
we
may
call
a
,
c
,
and
e.
however
,
admiral
halsey
reported
that
a
direct
attack
on
leyte
appeared
feasible
.
when
general
macarthur
received
the
report
from
admiral
halsey
's
task
force
,
he
also
concluded
that
it
might
be
possible
to
attack
the
japanese
in
the
philippine
directly-
bypassing
island
a
,
c
,
and
e.
admiral
nimitz
thereupon
offered
to
make
available
to
general
macarthur
several
division
which
had
been
scheduled
to
take
the
intermediate
objective
.
these
discussion
,
conducted
at
great
distance
,
all
took
place
in
one
day
.
general
macarthur
immediately
informed
the
joint
chief
of
staff
here
in
washington
that
he
wa
prepared
to
initiate
plan
for
an
attack
on
leyte
in
october
.
approval
of
the
change
in
plan
wa
given
on
the
same
day
.
thus
,
within
the
space
of
24
hour
,
a
major
change
of
plan
wa
accomplished
which
involved
army
and
navy
force
from
two
different
theater
of
operations-
a
change
which
hastened
the
liberation
of
the
philippine
and
the
final
day
of
victory-
a
change
which
saved
life
which
would
have
been
expended
in
the
capture
of
island
which
are
now
neutralized
far
behind
our
line
.
our
over-all
strategy
ha
not
neglected
the
important
task
of
rendering
all
possible
aid
to
china
.
despite
almost
insuperable
difficulty
,
we
increased
this
aid
during
1944
.
at
present
our
aid
to
china
must
be
accomplished
by
air
transport-
there
is
no
other
way
.
by
the
end
of
1944
,
the
air
transport
command
wa
carrying
into
china
a
tonnage
of
supply
three
time
a
great
a
that
delivered
a
year
ago
,
and
much
more
,
each
month
,
than
the
burma
road
ever
delivered
at
it
peak
.
despite
the
loss
of
important
base
in
china
,
the
tonnage
delivered
by
air
transport
ha
enabled
general
chennault
's
fourteenth
air
force
,
which
includes
many
chinese
flyer
,
to
wage
an
effective
and
aggressive
campaign
against
the
japanese
.
in
1944
aircraft
of
the
fourteenth
air
force
flew
more
than
35,000
sortie
against
the
japanese
and
sank
enormous
tonnage
of
enemy
shipping
,
greatly
diminishing
the
usefulness
of
the
china
sea
lane
.
british
,
dominion
,
and
chinese
force
together
with
our
own
have
not
only
held
the
line
in
burma
against
determined
japanese
attack
but
have
gained
base
of
considerable
importance
to
the
supply
line
into
china
.
the
burma
campaign
have
involved
incredible
hardship
,
and
have
demanded
exceptional
fortitude
and
determination
.
the
officer
and
men
who
have
served
with
so
much
devotion
in
these
far
distant
jungle
and
mountain
deserve
high
honor
from
their
countryman
.
in
all
of
the
far-flung
operation
of
our
own
armed
forces—on
land
,
and
sea
and
in
the
air—
the
final
job
,
the
toughest
job
,
ha
been
performed
by
the
average
,
easy-going
,
hard-fighting
young
american
,
who
carry
the
weight
of
battle
on
his
own
shoulder
.
it
is
to
him
that
we
and
all
future
generation
of
american
must
pay
grateful
tribute
.
but—it
is
of
small
satisfaction
to
him
to
know
that
monument
will
be
raised
to
him
in
the
future
.
he
want
,
he
need
,
and
he
is
entitled
to
insist
upon
,
our
full
and
active
support—now
.
although
unprecedented
production
figure
have
made
possible
our
victory
,
we
shall
have
to
increase
our
goal
even
more
in
certain
item
.
peak
delivery
of
supply

made
to
the
war
department
in
december
,
1943
.
due
in
part
to
cutback
,
we
have
not
produced
a
much
since
then
.
delivery
of
army
supply
were
down
by
15
percent
by
july
,
1944
,
before
the
upward
trend
wa
once
more
resumed
.
because
of
increased
demand
from
overseas
,
the
army
service
force
in
the
month
of
october
,
1944
,
had
to
increase
it
estimate
of
required
production
by
10
percent
.
but
in
november
,
one
month
later
,
the
requirement
for
1945
had
to
be
increased
another
10
percent
,
sending
the
production
goal
well
above
anything
we
have
yet
attained
.
our
armed
force
in
combat
have
steadily
increased
their
expenditure
of
medium
and
heavy
artillery
ammunition
.
a
we
continue
the
decisive
phase
of
this
war
,
the
munition
that
we
expend
will
mount
day
by
day
.
in
october
,
1944
,
while
some
were
saying
the
war
in
europe
wa
over
,
the
army
wa
shipping
more
men
to
europe
than
in
any
previous
month
of
the
war
.
one
of
the
most
urgent
immediate
requirement
of
the
armed
force
is
more
nurse
.
last
april
the
army
requirement
for
nurse
wa
set
at
50,000
.
actual
strength
in
nurse
wa
then
40,000
.
since
that
time
the
army
ha
tried
to
raise
the
additional
10,000
.
active
recruiting
ha
been
carried
on
,
but
the
net
gain
in
eight
month
ha
been
only
2,000
.
there
are
now
42,000
nurse
in
the
army
.
recent
estimate
have
increased
the
total
number
needed
to
60,000
.
that
mean
that
18,000
more
nurse
must
be
obtained
for
the
army
alone
and
the
navy
now
requires
2,000
additional
nurse
.
the
present
shortage
of
army
nurse
is
reflected
in
undue
strain
on
the
existing
force
.
more
than
a
thousand
nurse
are
now
hospitalized
,
and
part
of
this
is
due
to
overwork
.
the
shortage
is
also
indicated
by
the
fact
that
11
army
hospital
unit
have
been
sent
overseas
without
their
complement
of
nurse
.
at
army
hospital
in
the
united
state
there
is
only
1
nurse
to
26
bed
,
instead
of
the
recommended
1
to
15
bed
.
it
is
tragic
that
the
gallant
woman
who
have
volunteered
for
service
a
nurse
should
be
so
overworked
.
it
is
tragic
that
our
wounded
men
should
ever
want
for
the
best
possible
nursing
care
.
the
inability
to
get
the
needed
nurse
for
the
army
is
not
due
to
any
shortage
of
nurse
;
280,000
registered
nurse
are
now
practicing
in
this
country
.
it
ha
been
estimated
by
the
war
manpower
commission
that
27,000
additional
nurse
could
be
made
available
to
the
armed
force
without
interfering
too
seriously
with
the
need
of
the
civilian
population
for
nurse
.
since
volunteering
ha
not
produced
the
number
of
nurse
required
,
i
urge
that
the
selective
service
act
be
amended
to
provide
for
the
induction
of
nurse
into
the
armed
force
.
the
need
is
too
pressing
to
await
the
outcome
of
further
effort
at
recruiting
.
the
care
and
treatment
given
to
our
wounded
and
sick
soldier
have
been
the
best
known
to
medical
science
.
those
standard
must
be
maintained
at
all
cost
.
we
can
not
tolerate
a
lowering
of
them
by
failure
to
provide
adequate
nursing
for
the
brave
men
who
stand
desperately
in
need
of
it
.
in
the
continuing
progress
of
this
war
we
have
constant
need
for
new
type
of
weapon
,
for
we
can
not
afford
to
fight
the
war
of
today
or
tomorrow
with
the
weapon
of
yesterday
.
for
example
,
the
american
army
now
ha
developed
a
new
tank
with
a
gun
more
powerful
than
any
yet
mounted
on
a
fast-moving
vehicle
.
the
army
will
need
many
thousand
of
these
new
tank
in
1945
.
almost
every
month
find
some
new
development
in
electronics
which
must
be
put
into
production
in
order
to
maintain
our
technical
superiority—and
in
order
to
save
life
.
we
have
to
work
every
day
to
keep
ahead
of
the
enemy
in
radar
.
on
d-day
,
in
france
,
with
our
superior
new
equipment
,
we
located
and
then
put
out
of
operation
every
warning
set
which
the
german
had
along
the
french
coast
.
if
we
do
not
keep
constantly
ahead
of
our
enemy
in
the
development
of
new
weapon
,
we
pay
for
our
backwardness
with
the
life
's
blood
of
our
son
.
the
only
way
to
meet
these
increased
need
for
new
weapon
and
more
of
them
is
for
every
american
engaged
in
war
work
to
stay
on
his
war
job—for
additional
american
civilian
,
men
and
woman
,
not
engaged
in
essential
work
,
to
go
out
and
get
a
war
job
.
worker
who
are
released
because
their
production
is
cut
back
should
get
another
job
where
production
is
being
increased
.
this
is
no
time
to
quit
or
change
to
le
essential
job
.
there
is
an
old
and
true
saying
that
the
lord
hate
a
quitter
.
and
this
nation
must
pay
for
all
those
who
leave
their
essential
jobs-
or
all
those
who
lay
down
on
their
essential
job
for
nonessential
reason
.
and-again—that
payment
must
be
made
'with
the
life
's
blood
of
our
son
.
many
critical
production
program
with
sharply
rising
need
are
now
seriously
hampered
by
manpower
shortage
.
the
most
important
army
need
are
artillery
ammunition
,
cotton
duck
,
bomb
,
tire
,
tank
,
heavy
truck
,
and
even
b-29
's
.
in
each
of
these
vital
program
,
present
production
is
behind
requirement
.
navy
production
of
bombardment
ammunition
is
hampered
by
manpower
shortage
;
so
is
production
for
it
huge
rocket
program
.
labor
shortage
have
also
delayed
it
cruiser
and
carrier
program
,
and
production
of
certain
type
of
aircraft
.
there
is
critical
need
for
more
repair
worker
and
repair
part
;
this
jack
delay
the
return
of
damaged
fighting
ship
to
their
place
in
the
fleet
,
and
prevents
ship
now
in
the
fighting
line
from
getting
needed
overhauling
.
the
pool
of
young
men
under
26
classified
a
i-a
is
almost
depleted
.
increased
replacement
for
the
armed
force
will
take
men
now
deferred
who
are
at
work
in
war
industry
.
the
armed
force
must
have
an
assurance
of
a
steady
flow
of
young
men
for
replacement
.
meeting
this
paramount
need
will
be
difficult
,
and
will
also
make
it
progressively
more
difficult
to
attain
the
1945
production
goal
.
last
year
,
after
much
consideration
,
i
recommended
that
the
congress
adopt
a
national
service
act
a
the
most
efficient
and
democratic
way
of
insuring
full
production
for
our
war
requirement
.
this
recommendation
wa
not
adopted
.
i
now
again
call
upon
the
congress
to
enact
this
measure
for
the
total
mobilization
of
all
our
human
resource
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
.
i
urge
that
this
be
done
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
.
it
is
not
too
late
in
the
war
.
in
fact
,
bitter
experience
ha
shown
that
in
this
kind
of
mechanized
warfare
where
new
weapon
are
constantly
being
created
by
our
enemy
and
by
ourselves
,
the
closer
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
war
,
the
more
pressing
becomes
the
need
for
sustained
war
production
with
which
to
deliver
the
final
blow
to
the
enemy
.
there
are
three
basic
argument
for
a
national
service
law
:
first
,
it
would
assure
that
we
have
the
right
number
of
worker
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
.
second
,
it
would
provide
supreme
proof
to
all
our
fighting
men
that
we
are
giving
them
what
they
are
entitled
to
,
which
is
nothing
le
than
our
total
effort
.
and
,
third
,
it
would
be
the
final
,
unequivocal
answer
to
the
hope
of
the
nazi
and
the
japanese
that
we
may
become
halfhearted
about
this
war
and
that
they
can
get
from
u
a
negotiated
peace
.
national
service
legislation
would
make
it
possible
to
put
ourselves
in
a
position
to
assure
certain
and
speedy
action
in
meeting
our
manpower
need
.
it
would
be
used
only
to
the
extent
absolutely
required
by
military
necessity
.
in
fact
,
experience
in
great
britain
and
in
other
nation
at
war
indicates
that
use
of
the
compulsory
power
of
national
service
is
necessary
only
in
rare
instance
.
this
proposed
legislation
would
provide
against
loss
of
retirement
and
seniority
right
and
benefit
.
it
would
not
mean
reduction
in
wage
.
in
adopting
such
legislation
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
discard
the
voluntary
and
cooperative
process
which
have
prevailed
up
to
this
time
.
this
cooperation
ha
already
produced
great
result
.
the
contribution
of
our
worker
to
the
war
effort
ha
been
beyond
measure
.
we
must
build
on
the
foundation
that
have
already
been
laid
and
supplement
the
measure
now
in
operation
,
in
order
to
guarantee
the
production
that
may
be
necessary
in
the
critical
period
that
lie
ahead
.
at
the
present
time
we
are
using
the
inadequate
tool
at
hand
to
do
the
best
we
can
by
such
expedient
a
manpower
ceiling
,
and
the
use
of
priority
and
other
power
,
to
induce
men
and
woman
to
shift
from
non-essential
to
essential
war
job
.
i
am
in
receipt
of
a
joint
letter
from
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
,
dated
january
3
,
1945
,
which
say
:
``
with
the
experience
of
three
year
of
war
and
after
the
most
thorough
consideration
,
we
are
convinced
that
it
is
now
necessary
to
carry
out
the
statement
made
by
the
congress
in
the
joint
resolution
declaring
that
a
state
of
war
existed
with
japan
and
germany
:
that
'to
bring
the
conflict
to
a
successful
conclusion
,
all
of
the
resource
of
the
country
are
hereby
pledged
by
the
congress
of
the
united
state
.
'
``
in
our
considered
judgment
,
which
is
supported
by
general
marshall
and
admiral
king
,
this
requires
total
mobilization
of
our
manpower
by
the
passage
of
a
national
war
service
law
.
the
armed
force
need
this
legislation
to
hasten
the
day
of
final
victory
,
and
to
keep
to
a
minimum
the
cost
in
life
.
``
national
war

,
the
recognition
by
law
of
the
duty
of
every
citizen
to
do
his
or
her
part
in
winning
the
war
,
will
give
complete
assurance
that
the
need
for
war
equipment
will
be
filled
.
in
the
coming
year
we
must
increase
the
output
of
many
weapon
and
supply
on
short
notice
.
otherwise
we
shall
not
keep
our
production
abreast
of
the
swiftly
changing
need
of
war
.
at
the
same
time
it
will
be
necessary
to
draw
progressively
many
men
now
engaged
in
war
production
to
serve
with
the
armed
force
,
and
their
place
in
war
production
must
be
filled
promptly
.
these
development
will
require
the
addition
of
hundred
of
thousand
to
those
already
working
in
war
industry
.
we
do
not
believe
that
these
need
can
be
met
effectively
under
present
method
.
``
the
record
made
by
management
and
labor
in
war
industry
ha
been
a
notable
testimony
to
the
resourcefulness
and
power
of
america
.
the
need
are
so
great
,
nevertheless
,
that
in
many
instance
we
have
been
forced
to
recall
soldier
and
sailor
from
military
duty
to
do
work
of
a
civilian
character
in
war
production
,
because
of
the
urgency
of
the
need
for
equipment
and
because
of
inability
to
recruit
civilian
labor
.
''
pending
action
by
the
congress
on
the
broader
aspect
of
national
service
,
i
recommend
that
the
congress
immediately
enact
legislation
which
will
be
effective
in
using
the
service
of
the
4,000,000
men
now
classified
a
iv-f
in
whatever
capacity
is
best
for
the
war

in

field

we
propose
to
stand
together
with

not
for

alone
but
for
the
victory
for
which
the

is

is
not

which
unites
u

the

can
be
built-
and
it
will
be
built
.
but
the
continuance
and
assurance
of
a
living
peace
must
,
in
the
long
run
,
be
the
work
of
the
people
themselves
.
we
ourselves
,
like
all
people
who
have
gone
through
the
difficult
process
of
liberation
and
adjustment
,
know
of
our
own
experience
how
great
the
difficulty
can
be
.
we
know
that
they
are
not
difficulty
peculiar
to
any
continent
or
any
nation
.
our
own
revolutionary
war
left
behind
it
,
in
the
word
of
one
american
historian
,
``
an
eddy
of
lawlessness
and
disregard
of
human
life
.
''
there

of
one
kind
or
another
in
vermont

,
and
maine
.
there
were

,

or
threatened

in

and
new

.
these
difficulty
we
worked
out
for
ourselves
a
the
people
of
the
liberated
area
of
europe
,
faced
with
complex
problem
of
adjustment
,
will
work
out
their
difficulty
for
themselves
.
peace
can
be
made
and
kept
only
by
the
united
determination
of
free
and
peace-loving
people
who
are
willing
to
work
together-
willing
to
help
one
another—willing
to
respect
and
tolerate
and
try
to
understand
one
another
's
opinion
and
feeling
.
the
nearer
we
come
to
vanquishing
our
enemy
the
more
we
inevitably
become
conscious
of
difference
among
the
victor
.
we
must
not
let
those
difference
divide
u
and
blind
u
to
our
more
important
common
and
continuing
interest
in
winning
the
war
and
building
the
peace
.
international
cooperation
on
which
enduring
peace
must
be
based
is
not
a
one-way
street
.
nation
like
individual
do
not
always
see
alike
or
think
alike
,
and
international
cooperation
and
progress
are
not
helped
by
any
nation
assuming
that
it
ha
a
monopoly
of
wisdom
or
of
virtue
.
in
the
future
world
the
misuse
of
power
,
a
implied
in
the
term
``
power
politics
,
''
must
not
be
a
controlling
factor
in
international
relation
.
that
is
the
heart
of
the
principle
to
which
we
have
subscribed
.
we
can
not
deny
that
power
is
a
factor
in
world
politics
any
more
than
we
can
deny
it
existence
a
a
factor
in
national
politics
.
but
in
a
democratic
world
,
a
in
a
democratic
nation
,
power
must
be
linked
with
responsibility
,
and
obliged
to
defend
and
justify
itself
within
the
framework
of
the
general
good
.
perfectionism
,
no
le
than
isolationism
or
imperialism
or
power
politics
,
may
obstruct
the
path
to
international
peace
.
let
u
not
forget
that
the
retreat
to
isolationism
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
wa
started
not
by
a
direct
attack
against
international
cooperation
but
against
the
alleged
imperfection
of
the
peace
.
in
our
disillusionment
after
the
last
war
we
preferred
international
anarchy
to
international
cooperation
with
nation
which
did
not
see
and
think
exactly
a
we
did
.
we
gave
up
the
hope
of
gradually
achieving
a
better
peace
because
we
had
not
the
courage
to
fulfill
our
responsibility
in
an
admittedly
imperfect
world
.
we
must
not
let
that
happen
again
,
or
we
shall
follow
the
same
tragic
road
again—the
road
to
a
third
world
war
.
we
can
fulfill
our
responsibility
for
maintaining
the
security
of
our
own
country
only
by
exercising
our
power
and
our
influence
to
achieve
the
principle
in
which
we
believe
and
for
which
we
have
fought
.
in
august
,
1941
,
prime
minister
churchill
and
i
agreed
to
the
principle
of
the
atlantic
charter
,
these
being
later
incorporated
into
the
declaration
by
united
nation
of
january
1
,
1942
.
at
that
time
certain
isolationist
protested
vigorously
against
our
right
to
proclaim
the
principles—and
against
the
very
principle
themselves
.
today
,
many
of
the
same
people
are
protesting
against
the
possibility
of
violation
of
the
same
principle
.
it
is
true
that
the
statement
of
principle
in
the
atlantic
charter
doe
not
provide
rule
of
easy
application
to
each
and
every
one
of
this
war-torn
world
's
tangled
situation
.
but
it
is
a
good
and
a
useful
thing-
it
is
an
essential
thing-
to
have
principle
toward
which
we
can
aim
.
and
we
shall
not
hesitate
to
use
our
influence-
and
to
use
it
now—to
secure
so
far
a
is
humanly
possible
the
fulfillment
of
the
principle
of
the
atlantic
charter
.
we
have
not
shrunk
from
the
military
responsibility
brought
on
by
this
war
.
we
can
not
and
will
not
shrink
from
the
political
responsibility
which
follow
in
the
wake
of
battle
.
i
do
not
wish
to
give
the
impression
that
all
mistake
can
be
avoided
and
that
many
disappointment
are
not
inevitable
in
the
making
of
peace
.
but
we
must
not
this
time
lose
the
hope
of
establishing
an
international
order
which
will
be
capable
of
maintaining
peace
and
realizing
through
the
year
more
perfect
justice
between
nation
.
to
do
this
we
must
be
on
our
guard
not
to
exploit
and
exaggerate
the
difference
between
u
and
our
ally
,
particularly
with
reference
to
the
people
who
have
been
liberated
from
fascist
tyranny
.
that
is
not
the
way
to
secure
a
better
settlement
of
those
difference
or
to
secure
international
machinery
which
can
rectify
mistake
which
may
be
made
.
i
should
not
be
frank
if
i
did
not
admit
concern
about
many
situations—the
greek
and
polish
for
example
.
but
those
situation
are
not
a
easy
or
a
simple
to
deal
with
a
some
spokesman
,
whose
sincerity
i
do
not
question
,
would
have
u
believe
.
we
have
obligation
,
not
necessarily
legal
,
to
the
exiled
government
,
to
the
underground
leader
,
and
to
our
major
ally
who
came
much
nearer
the
shadow
than
we
did
.
we
and
our
ally
have
declared
that
it
is
our
purpose
to
respect
the
right
of
all
people
to
choose
the
form
of
government
under
which
they
will
live
and
to
see
sovereign
right
and
self-government
restored
to
those
who
have
been
forcibly
deprived
of
them
.
but
with
internal
dissension
,
with
many
citizen
of
liberated
country
still
prisoner
of
war
or
forced
to
labor
in
germany
,
it
is
difficult
to
guess
the
kind
of
self-government
the
people
really
want
.
during
the
interim
period
,
until
condition
permit
a
genuine
expression
of
the
people's
will
,
we
and
our
ally
have
a
duty
,
which
we
can
not
ignore
,
to
use
our
influence
to
the
end
that
no
temporary
or
provisional
authority
in
the
liberated
country
block
the
eventual
exercise
of
the
people
'
right
freely
to
choose
the
government
and
institution
under
which
,
a
freeman
,
they
are
to
live
.
it
is
only
too
easy
for
all
of
u
to
rationalize
what
we
want
to
believe
,
and
to
consider
those
leader
we
like
responsible
and
those
we
dislike
irresponsible
.
and
our
task
is
not
helped
by
stubborn
partisanship
,
however
understandable
on
the
part
of
opposed
internal
faction
.
it
is
our
purpose
to
help
the
peace-loving
people
of
europe
to
live
together
a
good
neighbor
,
to
recognize
their
common
interest
and
not
to
nurse
their
traditional
grievance
against
one
another
.
but
we
must
not
permit
the
many
specific
and
immediate
problem
of
adjustment
connected
with
the
liberation
of
europe
to
delay
the
establishment
of
permanent
machinery
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
.
under
the
threat
of
a
common
danger
,
the
united
nation
joined
together
in
war
to
preserve
their
independence
and
their
freedom
.
they
must
now
join
together
to
make
secure
the
independence
and
freedom
of
all
peace-loving
state
,
so
that
never
again
shall
tyranny
be
able
to
divide
and
conquer
.
international
peace
and
well-being
,
like
national
peace
and
well-being
,
require
constant
alertness
,
continuing
cooperation
,
and
organized
effort
.
international
peace
and
well-being
,
like
national
peace
and
well-being
,
can
be
secured
only
through
institution
capable
of
life
and
growth
.
many
of
the
problem
of
the
peace
are
upon
u
even
now
while
the
conclusion
of
the
war
is
still
before
u
.
the
atmosphere
of
friendship
and
mutual
understanding
and
determination
to
find
a
common
ground
of
common
understanding
,
which
surrounded
the
conversation
at
dumbarton
oak
,
give
u
reason
to
hope
that
future
discussion
will
succeed
in
developing
the
democratic
and
fully
integrated
world
security
system
toward
which
these
preparatory
conversation
were
directed
.
we
and
the
other
united
nation
are
going
forward
,
with
vigor
and
resolution
,
in
our
effort
to
create
such
a
system
by
providing
for
it
strong
and
flexible
institution
of
joint
and
cooperative
action
.
the
aroused
conscience
of
humanity
will
not
permit
failure
in
this
supreme
endeavor
.
we
believe
that
the
extraordinary
advance
in
the
mean
of
intercommunication
between
people
over
the
past
generation
offer
a
practical
method
of
advancing
the
mutual
understanding
upon
which
peace
and
the
institution
of
peace
must
rest
,
and
it
is
our
policy
and
purpose
to
use
these
great
technological
achievement
for
the
common
advantage
of
the
world
.
we
support
the
greatest
possible
freedom
of
trade
and
commerce
.
we
american
have
always
believed
in
freedom
of
opportunity
,
and
equality
of
opportunity
remains
one
of
the
principal
objective
of
our
national
life
.
what
we
believe
in
for
individual
,
we
believe
in
also
for
nation
.
we
are
opposed
to
restriction
,
whether
by
public
act
or
private
arrangement
,
which
distort
and
impair
commerce
,
transit
,
and
trade
.
we
have
house-cleaning
of
our
own
to
do
in
this
regard
.
but
it
is
our
hope
,
not
only
in
the
interest
of
our
own
prosperity
but
in
the
interest
of
the
prosperity
of
the
world
,
that
trade
and
commerce
and
access
to
material
and
market
may
be
freer
after
this
war
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
.
one
of
the
most
heartening
event
of
the
year
in
the
international
field
ha
been
the
renaissance
of
the
french
people
and
the
return
of
the
french
nation
to
the
rank
of
the
united
nation
.
far
from
having
been
crushed
by
the
terror
of
nazi
domination
,
the
french
people
have
emerged
with
stronger
faith
than
ever
in
the
destiny
of
their
country
and
in
the
soundness
of
the
democratic
ideal
to
which
the
french
nation
ha
traditionally
contributed
so
greatly
.
during
her
liberation
,
france
ha
given
proof
of
her
unceasing
determination
to
fight
the
german
,
continuing
the
heroic
effort
of
the
resistance
group
under
the
occupation
and
of
all
those
frenchman
throughout
the
world
who
refused
to
surrender
after
the
disaster
of
1940
.
today
,
french
army
are
again
on
the
german
frontier
,
and
are
again
fighting
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
our
son
.
since
our
landing
in
africa
,
we
have
placed
in
french
hand
all
the
arm
and
material
of
war
which
our
resource
and
the
military
situation
permitted
.
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
we
are
now
about
to
equip
large
new
french
force
with
the
most
modern
weapon
for
combat
duty
.
in
addition
to
the
contribution
which
france
can
make
to
our
common
victory
,
her
liberation
likewise
mean
that
her
great
influence
will
again
be
available
in
meeting
the
problem
of
peace
.
we
fully
recognize
france
's
vital
interest
in
a
lasting
solution
of
the
german
problem
and
the
contribution
which
she
can
make
in
achieving
international
security
.
her
formal
adherence
to
the
declaration
by
united
nation
a
few
day
ago
and
the
proposal
at
the
dumbarton
oak
discussion
,
whereby
france
would
receive
one
of
the
five
permanent
seat
in
the
proposed
security
council
,
demonstrate
the
extent
to
which
france
ha
resumed
her
proper
position
of
strength
and
leadership
.
i
am
clear
in
my
own
mind
that
,
a
an
essential
factor
in
the
maintenance
of
peace
in
the
future
,
we
must
have
universal
military
training
after
this
war
,
and
i
shall
send
a
special
message
to
the
congress
on
this
subject
.
an
enduring
peace
can
not
be
achieved
without
a
strong
america-
strong
in
the
social
and
economic
sense
a
well
a
in
the
military
sense
.
in
the
state
of
the
union
message
last
year
i
set
forth
what
i
considered
to
be
an
american
economic
bill
of
right
.
i
said
then
,
and
i
say
now
,
that
these
economic
truth
represent
a
second
bill
of
right
under
which
a
new
basis
of
security
and
prosperity
can
be
established
for
all-
regardless
of
station
,
race
,
or
creed
.
of
these
right
the
most
fundamental
,
and
one
on
which
the
fulfillment
of
the
others
in
large
degree
depends
,
is
the
``
right
to
a
useful
and
remunerative
job
in
the
industry
or
shop
or
farm
or
mine
of
the
nation
.
''
in
turn
,
others
of
the
economic
right
of
american
citizenship
,
such
a
the
right
to
a
decent
home
,
to
a
good
education
,
to
good
medical
care
,
to
social
security
,
to
reasonable
farm
income
,
will
,
if
fulfilled
,
make
major
contribution
to
achieving
adequate
level
of
employment
.
the
federal
government
must
see
to
it
that
these
right
become
realities—with
the
help
of
state
,
municipality
,
business
,
labor
,
and
agriculture
.
we
have
had
full
employment
during
the
war
.
we
have
had
it
because
the
government
ha
been
ready
to
buy
all
the
material
of
war
which
the
country
could
produce—and
this
ha
amounted
to
approximately
half
our
present
productive
capacity
.
after
the
war
we
must
maintain
full
employment
with
government
performing
it
peacetime
function
.
this
mean
that
we
must
achieve
a
level
of
demand
and
purchasing
power
by
private
consumers-
farmer
,
businessmen
,
worker
,
professional
men
,
housewives-
which
is
sufficiently
high
to
replace
wartime
government
demand
;
and
it
mean
also
that
we
must
greatly
increase
our
export
trade
above
the
prewar
level
.
our
policy
is
,
of
course
,
to
rely
a
much
a
possible
on
private
enterprise
to
provide
job
.
but
the
american
people
will
not
accept
mass
unemployment
or
mere
makeshift
work
.
there
will
be
need
for
the
work
of
everyone
willing
and
able
to
work—and
that
mean
close
to
60,000,000
job
.
full
employment
mean
not
only
jobs-
but
productive
job
.
american
do
not
regard
job
that
pay
substandard
wage
a
productive
job
.
we
must
make
sure
that
private
enterprise
work
a
it
is
supposed
to
work-
on
the
basis
of
initiative
and
vigorous
competition
,
without
the
stifling
presence
of
monopoly
and
cartel
.
during
the
war
we
have
guaranteed
investment
in
enterprise
essential
to
the
war
effort
.
we
should
also
take
appropriate
measure
in
peacetime
to
secure
opportunity
for
new
small
enterprise
and
for
productive
business
expansion
for
which
finance
would
otherwise
be
unavailable
.
this
necessary
expansion
of
our
peacetime
productive
capacity
will
require
new
facility
,
new
plant
,
and
new
equipment
.
it
will
require
large
outlay
of
money
which
should
be
raised
through
normal
investment
channel
.
but
while
private
capital
should
finance
this
expansion
program
,
the
government
should
recognize
it
responsibility
for
sharing
part
of
any
special
or
abnormal
risk
of
loss
attached
to
such
financing
.
our
full-employment
program
requires
the
extensive
development
of
our
natural
resource
and
other
useful
public
work
.
the
undeveloped
resource
of
this
continent
are
still
vast
.
our
river-watershed
project
will
add
new
and
fertile
territory
to
the
united
state
.
the
tennessee
valley
authority
,
which
wa
constructed
at
a
cost
of
$
750,000,000—the
cost
of
waging
this
war
for
le
than
4
days—was
a
bargain
.
we
have
similar
opportunity
in
our
other
great
river
basin
.
by
harnessing
the
resource
of
these
river
basin
,
a
we
have
in
the
tennessee
valley
,
we
shall
provide
the
same
kind
of
stimulus
to
enterprise
a
wa
provided
by
the
louisiana
purchase
and
the
new
discovery
in
the
west
during
the
nineteenth
century
.
if
we
are
to
avail
ourselves
fully
of
the
benefit
of
civil
aviation
,
and
if
we
are
to
use
the
automobile
we
can
produce
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
construct
thousand
of
airport
and
to
overhaul
our
entire
national
highway
system
.
the
provision
of
a
decent
home
for
every
family
is
a
national
necessity
,
if
this
country
is
to
be
worthy
of
it
greatness—and
that
task
will
itself
create
great
employment
opportunity
.
most
of
our
city
need
extensive
rebuilding
.
much
of
our
farm
plant
is
in
a
state
of
disrepair
.
to
make
a
frontal
attack
on
the
problem
of
housing
and
urban
reconstruction
will
require
thoroughgoing
cooperation
between
industry
and
labor
,
and
the
federal
,
state
,
and
local
government
.
an
expanded
social
security
program
,
and
adequate
health
and
education
program
,
must
play
essential
role
in
a
program
designed
to
support
individual
productivity
and
mass
purchasing
power
.
i
shall
communicate
further
with
the
congress
on
these
subject
at
a
later
date
.
the
million
of
productive
job
that
a
program
of
this
nature
could
bring
are
job
in
private
enterprise
.
they
are
job
based
on
the
expanded
demand
for
the
output
of
our
economy
for
consumption
and
investment
.
through
a
program
of
this
character
we
can
maintain
a
national
income
high
enough
to
provide
for
an
orderly
retirement
of
the
public
debt
along
with
reasonable
tax
reduction
.
our
present
tax
system
geared
primarily
to
war
requirement
must
be
revised
for
peacetime
so
a
to
encourage
private
demand
.
while
no
general
revision
of
the
tax
structure
can
be
made
until
the
war
end
on
all
front
,
the
congress
should
be
prepared
to
provide
tax
modification
at
the
end
of
the
war
in
europe
,
designed
to
encourage
capital
to
invest
in
new
enterprise
and
to
provide
job
.
a
an
integral
part
of
this
program
to
maintain
high
employment
,
we
must
,
after
the
war
is
over
,
reduce
or
eliminate
tax
which
bear
too
heavily
on
consumption
.
the
war
will
leave
deep
disturbance
in
the
world
economy
,
in
our
national
economy
,
in
many
community
,
in
many
family
,
and
in
many
individual
.
it
will
require
determined
effort
and
responsible
action
of
all
of
u
to
find
our
way
back
to
peacetime
,
and
to
help
others
to
find
their
way
back
to
peacetime-
a
peacetime
that
hold
the
value
of
the
past
and
the
promise
of
the
future
.
if
we
attack
our
problem
with
determination
we
shall
succeed
.
and
we
must
succeed
.
for
freedom
and
peace
can
not
exist
without
security
.
during
the
past
year
the
american
people
,
in
a
national
election
,
reasserted
their
democratic
faith
.
in
the
course
of
that
campaign
various
reference
were
made
to
``
strife
''
between
this
administration
and
the
congress
,
with
the
implication
,
if
not
the
direct
assertion
,
that
this
administration
and
the
congress
could
never
work
together
harmoniously
in
the
service
of
the
nation
.
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
have
been
disagreement
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branches—as
there
have
been
disagreement
during
the
past
century
and
a
half
.
i
think
we
all
realize
too
that
there
are
some
people
in
this
capital
city
whose
task
is
in
large
part
to
stir
up
dissension
,
and
to
magnify
normal
healthy
disagreement
so
that
they
appear
to
be
irreconcilable
conflict
.
but-
i
think
that
the
over-all
record
in
this
respect
is
eloquent
:
the
government
of
the
united
state
of
america—all
branch
of
it-
ha
a
good
record
of
achievement
in
this
war
.
the
congress
,
the
executive
,
and
the
judiciary
have
worked
together
for
the
common
good
.
i
myself
want
to
tell
you
,
the
member
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representative
,
how
happy
i
am
in
our
relationship
and
friendship
.
i
have
not
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
some
of
the
new
member
in
each
house
,
but
i
hope
that
opportunity
will
offer
itself
in
the
near
future
.
we
have
a
great
many
problem
ahead
of
u
and
we
must
approach
them
with
realism
and
courage
.
this
new
year
of
1945
can
be
the
greatest
year
of
achievement
in
human
history
.
nineteen
forty-five
can
see
the
final
ending
of
the
nazi-fascist
reign
of
terror
in
europe
.
nineteen
forty-five
can
see
the
closing
in
of
the
force
of
retribution
about
the
center
of
the
malignant
power
of
imperialistic
japan
.
most
important
of
all—1945
can
and
must
see
the
substantial
beginning
of
the
organization
of
world
peace
.
this
organization
must
be
the
fulfillment
of
the
promise
for
which
men
have
fought
and
died
in
this
war
.
it
must
be
the
justification
of
all
the
sacrifice
that
have
been
made-
of
all
the
dreadful
misery
that
this
world
ha
endured
.
we
american
of
today
,
together
with
our
ally
,
are
making
history-
and
i
hope
it
will
be
better
history
than
ever
ha
been
made
before
.
we
pray
that
we
may
be
worthy
of
the
unlimited
opportunity
that
god
ha
given
u
.
