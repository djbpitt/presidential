to
the
congress
of
the
united
state
:
a
you
assemble
for
the
discharge
of
the
duty
you
have
assumed
a
the
representative
of
a
free
and
generous
people
,
your
meeting
is
marked
by
an
interesting
and
impressive
incident
.
with
the
expiration
of
the
present
session
of
the
congress
the
first
century
of
our
constitutional
existence
a
a
nation
will
be
completed
.
our
survival
for
one
hundred
year
is
not
sufficient
to
assure
u
that
we
no
longer
have
danger
to
fear
in
the
maintenance
,
with
all
it
promised
blessing
,
of
a
government
rounded
upon
the
freedom
of
the
people
.
the
time
rather
admonishes
u
to
soberly
inquire
whether
in
the
past
we
have
always
closely
kept
in
the
course
of
safety
,
and
whether
we
have
before
u
a
way
plain
and
clear
which
lead
to
happiness
and
perpetuity
.
when
the
experiment
of
our
government
wa
undertaken
,
the
chart
adopted
for
our
guidance
wa
the
constitution
.
departure
from
the
line
there
laid
down
is
failure
.
it
is
only
by
a
strict
adherence
to
the
direction
they
indicate
and
by
restraint
within
the
limitation
they
fix
that
we
can
furnish
proof
to
the
world
of
the
fitness
of
the
american
people
for
self-government
.
the
equal
and
exact
justice
of
which
we
boast
a
the
underlying
principle
of
our
institution
should
not
be
confined
to
the
relation
of
our
citizen
to
each
other
.
the
government
itself
is
under
bond
to
the
american
people
that
in
the
exercise
of
it
function
and
power
it
will
deal
with
the
body
of
our
citizen
in
a
manner
scrupulously
honest
and
fair
and
absolutely
just
.
it
ha
agreed
that
american
citizenship
shall
be
the
only
credential
necessary
to
justify
the
claim
of
equality
before
the
law
,
and
that
no
condition
in
life
shall
give
rise
to
discrimination
in
the
treatment
of
the
people
by
their
government
.
the
citizen
of
our
republic
in
it
early
day
rigidly
insisted
upon
full
compliance
with
the
letter
of
this
bond
,
and
saw
stretching
out
before
him
a
clear
field
for
individual
endeavor
.
his
tribute
to
the
support
of
his
government
wa
measured
by
the
cost
of
it
economical
maintenance
,
and
he
wa
secure
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
remaining
recompense
of
his
steady
and
contented
toil
.
in
those
day
the
frugality
of
the
people
wa
stamped
upon
their
government
,
and
wa
enforced
by
the
free
,
thoughtful
,
and
intelligent
suffrage
of
the
citizen
.
combination
,
monopoly
,
and
aggregation
of
capital
were
either
avoided
or
sternly
regulated
and
restrained
.
the
pomp
and
glitter
of
government
le
free
offered
no
temptation
and
presented
no
delusion
to
the
plain
people
who
,
side
by
side
,
in
friendly
competition
,
wrought
for
the
ennoblement
and
dignity
of
man
,
for
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
free
government
,
and
for
the
achievement
of
the
grand
destiny
awaiting
the
land
which
god
had
given
them
.
a
century
ha
passed
.
our
city
are
the
abiding
place
of
wealth
and
luxury
;
our
manufactory
yield
fortune
never
dreamed
of
by
the
father
of
the
republic
;
our
business
men
are
madly
striving
in
the
race
for
rich
,
and
immense
aggregation
of
capital
outrun
the
imagination
in
the
magnitude
of
their
undertaking
.
we
view
with
pride
and
satisfaction
this
bright
picture
of
our
country
's
growth
and
prosperity
,
while
only
a
closer
scrutiny
develops
a
somber
shading
.
upon
more
careful
inspection
we
find
the
wealth
and
luxury
of
our
city
mingled
with
poverty
and
wretchedness
and
unremunerative
toil
.
a
crowded
and
constantly
increasing
urban
population
suggests
the
impoverishment
of
rural
section
and
discontent
with
agricultural
pursuit
.
the
farmer
's
son
,
not
satisfied
with
his
father
's
simple
and
laborious
life
,
join
the
eager
chase
for
easily
acquired
wealth
.
we
discover
that
the
fortune
realized
by
our
manufacturer
are
no
longer
solely
the
reward
of
sturdy
industry
and
enlightened
foresight
,
but
that
they
result
from
the
discriminating
favor
of
the
government
and
are
largely
built
upon
undue
exaction
from
the
mass
of
our
people
.
the
gulf
between
employer
and
the
employed
is
constantly
widening
,
and
class
are
rapidly
forming
,
one
comprising
the
very
rich
and
powerful
,
while
in
another
are
found
the
toiling
poor
.
a
we
view
the
achievement
of
aggregated
capital
,
we
discover
the
existence
of
trust
,
combination
,
and
monopoly
,
while
the
citizen
is
struggling
far
in
the
rear
or
is
trampled
to
death
beneath
an
iron
heel
.
corporation
,
which
should
be
the
carefully
restrained
creature
of
the
law
and
the
servant
of
the
people
,
are
fast
becoming
the
people
's
master
.
still
congratulating
ourselves
upon
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
our
country
and
complacently
contemplating
every
incident
of
change
inseparable
from
these
condition
,
it
is
our
duty
a
patriotic
citizen
to
inquire
at
the
present
stage
of
our
progress
how
the
bond
of
the
government
made
with
the
people
ha
been
kept
and
performed
.
instead
of
limiting
the
tribute
drawn
from
our
citizen
to
the
necessity
of
it
economical
administration
,
the
government
persists
in
exacting
from
the
substance
of
the
people
million
which
,
unapplied
and
useless
,
lie
dormant
in
it
treasury
.
this
flagrant
injustice
and
this
breach
of
faith
and
obligation
add
to
extortion
the
danger
attending
the
diversion
of
the
currency
of
the
country
from
the
legitimate
channel
of
business
.
under
the
same
law
by
which
these
result
are
produced
the
government
permit
many
million
more
to
be
added
to
the
cost
of
the
living
of
our
people
and
to
be
taken
from
our
consumer
,
which
unreasonably
swell
the
profit
of
a
small
but
powerful
minority
.
the
people
must
still
be
taxed
for
the
support
of
the
government
under
the
operation
of
tariff
law
.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
mass
of
our
citizen
are
inordinately
burdened
beyond
any
useful
public
purpose
and
for
the
benefit
of
a
favored
few
,
the
government
,
under
pretext
of
an
exercise
of
it
taxing
power
,
enters
gratuitously
into
partnership
with
these
favorite
,
to
their
advantage
and
to
the
injury
of
a
vast
majority
of
our
people
.
this
is
not
equality
before
the
law
.
the
existing
situation
is
injurious
to
the
health
of
our
entire
body
politic
.
it
stifle
in
those
for
whose
benefit
it
is
permitted
all
patriotic
love
of
country
,
and
substitute
in
it
place
selfish
greed
and
grasping
avarice
.
devotion
to
american
citizenship
for
it
own
sake
and
for
what
it
should
accomplish
a
a
motive
to
our
nation
's
advancement
and
the
happiness
of
all
our
people
is
displaced
by
the
assumption
that
the
government
,
instead
of
being
the
embodiment
of
equality
,
is
but
an
instrumentality
through
which
especial
and
individual
advantage
are
to
be
gained
.
the
arrogance
of
this
assumption
is
unconcealed
.
it
appears
in
the
sordid
disregard
of
all
but
personal
interest
,
in
the
refusal
to
abate
for
the
benefit
of
others
one
iota
of
selfish
advantage
,
and
in
combination
to
perpetuate
such
advantage
through
effort
to
control
legislation
and
improperly
influence
the
suffrage
of
the
people
.
the
grievance
of
those
not
included
within
the
circle
of
these
beneficiary
,
when
fully
realized
,
will
surely
arouse
irritation
and
discontent
.
our
farmer
,
long
suffering
and
patient
,
struggling
in
the
race
of
life
with
the
hardest
and
most
unremitting
toil
,
will
not
fail
to
see
,
in
spite
of
misrepresentation
and
misleading
fallacy
,
that
they
are
obliged
to
accept
such
price
for
their
product

fixed
in
foreign
market
where
they
compete
with
the
farmer
of
the
world
;
that
their
land
are
declining
in
value
while
their
debt
increase
,
and
that
without
compensating
favor
they
are
forced
by
the
action
of
the
government
to
pay
for
the
benefit
of
others
such
enhanced
price
for
the
thing
they
need
that
the
scanty
return
of
their
labor
fail
to
furnish
their
support
or
leave
no
margin
for
accumulation
.
our
workingman
,
enfranchised
from
all
delusion
and
no
longer
frightened
by
the
cry
that
their
wage
are
endangered
by
a
just
revision
of
our
tariff
law
,
will
reasonably
demand
through
such
revision
steadier
employment
,
cheaper
mean
of
living
in
their
home
,
freedom
for
themselves
and
their
child
from
the
doom
of
perpetual
servitude
,
and
an
open
door
to
their
advancement
beyond
the
limit
of
a
laboring
class
.
others
of
our
citizen
,
whose
comfort
and
expenditure
are
measured
by
moderate
salary
and
fixed
income
,
will
insist
upon
the
fairness
and
justice
of
cheapening
the
cost
of
necessary
for
themselves
and
their
family
.
when
to
the
selfishness
of
the
beneficiary
of
unjust
discrimination
under
our
law
there
shall
be
added
the
discontent
of
those
who
suffer
from
such
discrimination
,
we
will
realize
the
fact
that
the
beneficent
purpose
of
our
government
,
dependent
upon
the
patriotism
and
contentment
of
our
people
,
are
endangered
.
communism
is
a
hateful
thing
and
a
menace
to
peace
and
organized
government
;
but
the
communism
of
combined
wealth
and

,
the
outgrowth
of
overweening
cupidity
and
selfishness
,
which
insidiously
undermines
the
justice
and
integrity
of

,
is
not
le
dangerous
than
the
communism
of
oppressed
poverty
and
toil
,

exasperated
by
injustice
and

attack
with
wild
disorder
the
citadel
of

people
who
proposes
that
the
government
shall
protect

that

in

will
care
for

between

the
least
delegation
of
the
care
and
protection
the
government
owes
to

make
the
boast
of
free
institution
a
glittering
delusion
and
the
pretended
boon
of
american
citizenship
a
shameless
imposition
.
a
just
and
sensible
revision
of
our
tariff
law
should
be
made
for
the
relief
of
those
of
our
countryman
who
suffer
under
present
condition
.
such
a
revision
should
receive
the
support
of
all
who
love
that
justice
and
equality
due
to
american
citizenship
;
of
all
who
realize
that
in
this
justice
and
equality
our
government
find
it
strength
and
it
power
to
protect
the
citizen
and
his
property
;
of
all
who
believe
that
the
contented
competence
and
comfort
of
many
accord
better
with
the
spirit
of
our
institution
than
colossal
fortune
unfairly
gathered
in
the
hand
of
a
few
;
of
all
who
appreciate
that
the
forbearance
and
fraternity
among
our
people
,
which
recognize
the
value
of
every
american
interest
,
are
the
surest
guaranty
of
our
national
progress
,
and
of
all
who
desire
to
see
the
product
of
american
skill
and
ingenuity
in
every
market
of
the
world
,
with
a
resulting
restoration
of
american
commerce
.
the
necessity
of
the
reduction
of
our
revenue
is
so
apparent
a
to
be
generally
conceded
,
but
the
mean
by
which
this
end
shall
be
accomplished
and
the
sum
of
direct
benefit
which
shall
result
to
our
citizen
present
a
controversy
of
the
utmost
importance
.
there
should
be
no
scheme

by
which
the
burden
of
the
people
are
only
apparently
removed

extravagant
appropriation
of
public
money
,
with
all
their
demoralizing
consequence
,
should
not
be
tolerated
,
either
a
a
mean
of
relieving

surplus
or
a

pretext
for
resisting
a
proper
reduction
in

rate
.
existing
evil
and
injustice
should
be
honestly
recognized
,
boldly
met
,
and
effectively
remedied
.
there
should
be
no
cessation
of
the
struggle
until
a
plan
is
perfected
,
fair
and
conservative
toward
existing
industry
,
but
which
will
reduce
the
cost
to
consumer
of
the
necessary
of

,
while
it
provides
for
our
manufacturer
the
advantage
of
freer
raw
material
and
permit
no
injury
to
the
interest
of
american
labor
.
the
cause
for
which
the
battle
is
waged
is
comprised
within
line
clearly
and
distinctly
defined
.
it
should
never
be
compromised
.
it
is
the
people
's
cause
.
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
selfish
and
private
interest
which
are
so
persistently
heard
when
effort
are
made
to
deal
in
a
just
and
comprehensive
manner
with
our
tariff
law
are
related
to
,
if
they
are
not
responsible
for
,
the
sentiment
largely
prevailing
among
the
people
that
the
general
government
is
the
fountain
of
individual
and
private
aid
;
that
it
may
be
expected
to
relieve
with
paternal
care
the
distress
of
citizen
and
community
,
and
that
from
the
fullness
of
it
treasury
it
should
,
upon
the
slightest
possible
pretext
of
promoting
the
general
good
,
apply
public
fund
to
the
benefit
of
locality
and
individual
.
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
there
is
a
growing
assumption
that
,
a
against
the
government
and
in
favor
of
private
claim
and
interest
,
the
usual
rule
and
limitation
of
business
principle
and
just
dealing
should
be
waived
.
these
idea
have
been
unhappily
much
encouraged
by
legislative
acquiescence
.
relief
from
contract
made
with
the
government
is
too
easily
accorded
in
favor
of
the
citizen
;
the
failure
to
support
claim
against
the
government
by
proof
is
often
supplied
by
no
better
consideration
than
the
wealth
of
the
government
and
the
poverty
of
the
claimant
;
gratuity
in
the
form
of
pension
are
granted
upon
no
other
real
ground
than
the
needy
condition
of
the
applicant
,
or
for
reason
le
valid
;
and
large
sum
are
expended
for
public
building
and
other
improvement
upon
representation
scarcely
claimed
to
be
related
to
public
need
and
necessity
.
the
extent
to
which
the
consideration
of
such
matter
subordinate
and
postpone
action
upon
subject
of
great
public
importance
,
but
involving
no
special
private
or
partisan
interest
,
should
arrest
attention
and
lead
to
reformation
.
a
few
of
the
numerous
illustration
of
this
condition
may
be
stated
.
the
crowded
condition
of
the
calendar
of
the
supreme
court
,
and
the
delay
to
suitor
and
denial
of
justice
resulting
therefrom
,
ha
been
strongly
urged
upon
the
attention
of
the
congress
,
with
a
plan
for
the
relief
of
the
situation
approved
by
those
well
able
to
judge
of
it
merit
.
while
this
subject
remains
without
effective
consideration
,
many
law
have
been
passed
providing
for
the
holding
of
term
of
inferior
court
at
place
to
suit
the
convenience
of
locality
,
or
to
lay
the
foundation
of
an
application
for
the
erection
of
a
new
public
building
.
repeated
recommendation
have
been
submitted
for
the
amendment
and
change
of
the
law
relating
to
our
public
land
so
that
their
spoliation
and
diversion
to
other
us
than
a
home
for
honest
settler
might
be
prevented
.
while
a
measure
to
meet
this
conceded
necessity
of
reform
remains
awaiting
the
action
of
the
congress
,
many
claim
to
the
public
land
and
application
for
their
donation
,
in
favor
of
state
and
individual
,
have
been
allowed
.
a
plan
in
aid
of
indian
management
,
recommended
by
those
well
informed
a
containing
valuable
feature
in
furtherance
of
the
solution
of
the
indian
problem
,
ha
thus
far
failed
of
legislative
sanction
,
while
grant
of
doubtful
expediency
to
railroad
corporation
,
permitting
them
to
pas
through
indian
reservation
,
have
greatly
multiplied
.
the
propriety
and
necessity
of
the
erection
of
one
or
more
prison
for
the
confinement
of
united
state
convict
,
and
a
post-office
building
in
the
national
capital
,
are
not
disputed
.
but
these
need
yet
remain
answered
,
while
score
of
public
building
have
been
erected
where
their
necessity
for
public
purpose
is
not
apparent
.
a
revision
of
our
pension
law
could
easily
be
made
which
would
rest
upon
just
principle
and
provide
for
every
worthy
applicant
.
but
while
our
general
pension
law
remain
confused
and
imperfect
,
hundred
of
private
pension
law
are

appropriation
bill
for
the
support
of
the
government
are
defaced
by
item
and
provision
to
meet
private
end
,
and
it
is
freely
asserted
by
responsible
and
experienced
party
that
a
bill
appropriating
money
for
public
internal
improvement
would
fail
to
meet
with
favor
unless
it
contained
item
more
for
local
and
private
advantage
than
for
public
benefit
.
these
statement
can
be
much
emphasized
by
an
ascertainment
of
the
proportion
of
federal
legislation
which
either
bear
upon
it
face
it
private
character
or
which
upon
examination
develops
such
a
motive

yet
the
people
wait
and
expect
from
their
chosen
representative
such
patriotic
action
a
will
advance
the
welfare
of
the
entire
country
;
and
this
expectation
can
only
be
answered
by
the
performance
of
public
duty
with
unselfish
purpose

our
mission
among
the
nation
of
the
earth
and
our
success
in
accomplishing
the
work
god
ha
given
the
american
people
to
do
require
of
those
intrusted
with
the
making
and
execution
of
our
law
perfect
devotion
,
above
all
other
thing
,
to
the
public
good
.
this
devotion
will
lead
u
to
strongly
resist
all
impatience
of
constitutional
limitation
of
federal
power
and
to
persistently
check
the
increasing
tendency
to
extend
the
scope
of
federal
legislation
into
the
domain
of
state
and
local
jurisdiction
upon
the
plea
of
subserving
the
public
welfare
.
the
preservation
of
the
partition
between
proper
subject
of
federal
and
local
care
and
regulation
is
of
such
importance
under
the
constitution
,
which
is
the
law
of
our
very
existence
,
that
no
consideration
of
expediency
or
sentiment
should
tempt
u
to
enter
upon
doubtful
ground
.
we
have
undertaken
to
discover
and
proclaim
the
richest
blessing
of
a
free
government
,
with
the
constitution
a
our
guide
.
let
u
follow
the
way
it
point
out
;
it
will
not
mislead
u
.
and
surely
no
one
who
ha
taken
upon
himself
the
solemn
obligation
to
support
and
preserve
the
constitution
can
find
justification
or
solace
for
disloyalty
in
the
excuse
that
he
wandered
and
disobeyed
in
search
of
a
better
way
to
reach
the
public
welfare
than
the
constitution
offer
.
what
ha
been
said
is
deemed
not
inappropriate
at
a
time
when
,
from
a
century
's
height
,
we
view
the
way
already
trod
by
the
american
people
and
attempt
to
discover
their
future
path

the
seventh
president
of
the
united
state
--
the
soldier
and
statesman
and
at
all
time
the
firm
and
brave
friend
of
the
people
--
in
vindication
of
his
course
a
the
protector
of
popular
right
and
the
champion
of
true
american
citizenship
,
declared
:
the
ambition
which
lead
me
on
is
an
anxious
desire
and
a
fixed
determination
to
restore
to
the
people
unimpaired
the
sacred
trust
they
have
confided
to
my
charge
;
to
,
heal
the
wound
of
the
constitution
and
to
preserve
it
from
further
violation
;
to
persuade
my
countryman
,
so
far
a
i
may
,
that
it
is
not
in
a
splendid
government
supported
by
powerful
monopoly
and
aristocratical
establishment
that
they
will
find
happiness
or
their
liberty
protection
,
but
in
a
plain
system
,
void
of
pomp
,
protecting
all
and
granting
favor
to
none
,
dispensing
it
blessing
like
the
dew
of
heaven
,
unseen
and
unfelt
save
in
the
freshness
and
beauty
they
contribute
to
produce
.
it
is
such
a
government
that
the
genius
of
our
people
requires
--
such
an
one
only
under
which
our
state
may
remain
for
age
to
come
united
,
prosperous
,
and
free
.
in
pursuance
of
a
constitutional
provision
requiring
the
president
from
time
to
time
to
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
,
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
announce
that
the
close
of
the
year
find
the
united
state
in
the
enjoyment
of
domestic
tranquillity
and
at
peace
with
all
the
nation
.
since
my
last
annual
message
our
foreign
relation
have
been
strengthened
and
improved
by
performance
of
international
good
office
and
by
new
and
renewed
treaty
of
amity
,
commerce
,
and
reciprocal
extradition
of
criminal
.
those
international
question
which
still
await
settlement
are
all
reasonably
within
the
domain
of
amicable
negotiation
,
and
there
is
no
existing
subject
of
dispute
between
the
united
state
and
any
foreign
power
that
is
not
susceptible
of
satisfactory
adjustment
by
frank
diplomatic
treatment
.
the
question
between
great
britain
and
the
united
state
relating
to
the
right
of
american
fisherman
,
under
treaty
and
international
comity
,
in
the
territorial
water
of
canada
and
newfoundland
,
i
regret
to
say
,
are
not
yet
satisfactorily
adjusted
.
these
matter
were
fully
treated
in
my
message
to
the
senate
of
february
20
1888
,
together
with
which
a
convention
,
concluded
under
my
authority
with
her
majesty's
government
on
the
15th
of
february
last
,
for
the
removal
of
all
cause
of
misunderstanding
,
wa
submitted
by
me
for
the
approval
of
the
senate
.
this
treaty
having
been
rejected
by
the
senate
,
i
transmitted
a
message
to
the
congress
on
the
23d
of
august
last
reviewing
the
transaction
and
submitting
for
consideration
certain
recommendation
for
legislation
concerning
the
important
question
involved
.
afterwards
,
on
the
12th
of
september
,
in
response
to
a
resolution
of
the
senate
,
i
again
communicated
fully
all
the
information
in
my
possession
a
to
the
action
of
the
government
of
canada
affecting
the
commercial
relation
between
the
dominion
and
the
united
state
,
including
the
treatment
of
american
fishing
vessel
in
the
port
and
water
of
british
north
america
.
these
communication
have
all
been
published
,
and
therefore
opened
to
the
knowledge
of
both
house
of
congress
,
although
two
were
addressed
to
the
senate
alone
.
comment
upon
or
repetition
of
their
content
would
be
superfluous
,
and
i
am
not
aware
that
anything
ha
since
occurred
which
should
be
added
to
the
fact
therein
stated
.
therefore
i
merely
repeat
,
a
applicable
to
the
present
time
,
the
statement
which
will
be
found
in
my
message
to
the
senate
of
september
12
last
,
that
--
since
march
3
,
1887
,
no
case
ha
been
reported
to
the
department
of
state
wherein
complaint
wa
made
of
unfriendly
or
unlawful
treatment
of
american
fishing
vessel
on
the
part
of
the
canadian
authority
in
which
reparation
wa
not
promptly
and
satisfactorily
obtained
by
the
united
state
consul-general
at
halifax
.
having
essayed
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
to
procure
by
negotiation
the
settlement
of
a
long-standing
cause
of
dispute
and
to
remove
a
constant
menace
to
the
good
relation
of
the
two
country
,
and
continuing
to
be
of
opinion
that
the
treaty
of
february
last
,
which
failed
to
receive
the
approval
of
the
senate
,
did
supply
``
a
satisfactory
,
practical
,
and
final
adjustment
,
upon
a
basis
honorable
and
just
to
both
party
,
of
the
difficult
and
vexed
question
to
which
it
related
,
''
and
having
subsequently
and
unavailingly
recommended
other
legislation
to
congress
which
i
hoped
would
suffice
to
meet
the
exigency
created
by
the
rejection
of
the
treaty
,
i
now
again
invoke
the
earnest
and
immediate
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
condition
of
this
important
question
a
it
now
stand
before
them
and
the
country
,
and
for
the
settlement
of
which
i
am
deeply
solicitous
.
near
the
close
of
the
month
of
october
last
occurrence
of
a
deeply
regrettable
nature
were
brought
to
my
knowledge
,
which
made
it
my
painful
but
imperative
duty
to
obtain
with
a
little
delay
a
possible
a
new
personal
channel
of
diplomatic
intercourse
in
this
country
with
the
government
of
great
britain
.
the
correspondence
in
relation
to
this
incident
will
in
due
course
be
laid
before
you
,
and
will
disclose
the
unpardonable
conduct
of
the
official
referred
to
in
his
interference
by
advice
and
counsel
with
the
suffrage
of
american
citizen
in
the
very
crisis
of
the
presidential
election
then
near
at
hand
,
and
also
in
his
subsequent
public
declaration
to
justify
his
action
,
superadding
impugnment
of
the
executive
and
senate
of
the
united
state
in
connection
with
important
question
now
pending
in
controversy
between
the
two
government
.
the
offense
thus
committed
wa
most
grave
,
involving
disastrous
possibility
to
the
good
relation
of
the
united
state
and
great
britain
,
constituting
a
gross
breach
of
diplomatic
privilege
and
an
invasion
of
the
purely
domestic
affair
and
essential
sovereignty
of
the
government
to
which
the
envoy
wa
accredited
.
having
first
fulfilled
the
just
demand
of
international
comity
by
affording
full
opportunity
for
her
majesty
's
government
to
act
in
relief
of
the
situation
,
i
considered
prolongation
of
discussion
to
be
unwarranted
,
and
thereupon
declined
to
further
recognize
the
diplomatic
character
of
the
person
whose
continuance
in
such
function
would
destroy
that
mutual
confidence
which
is
essential
to
the
good
understanding
of
the
two
government
and
wa
inconsistent
with
the
welfare
and
self-respect
of
the
government
of
the
united
state
.
the
usual
interchange
of
communication
ha
since
continued
through
her
majesty
's
legation
in
this
city

my
endeavor

international
cooperation

for
the
prevention

not
been

being

to
submit

effective
and
satisfactory
conventional
projet
with

for
the
approval
of

the
coastal
boundary
between

alaskan
possession
and

columbia
,
i
regret
to
say
,
ha
not
received
the
attention
demanded
by
it

,
and
which
on
several
occasion
heretofore
i
have
had
the
honor
to

it
absolutely

appropriation

survey

an
essential
prerequisite
for

it
is
much
to
be
desired

agreement

reached
with

by
which
the
damage
to
life

approval

1st
day

exclusion
of
chinese
laborer

full
information

the
negotiation

treaty

,
having
been
confirmed
by
the
senate
with

amendment

rejected
by
the
chinese
government

this
message

a
recommendation
that

sum

money
be
appropriated

compensation
to
chinese
subject

had
suffered
injury
at

hand

men

such
appropriation
having
been
duly
made
,
the
fund
awaits
reception
by

chinese
government

it
is
sincerely
hoped
that
by
the
cessation

this
class
of

subject

in

wish

notification

given
by

japanese
minister
at
this
capital
of
the
adjournment
of
the
conference
for
the
revision
of
the
treaty
of
japan
with
foreign
power
,
owing
to
the
objection
of
his
government
to
the
provision
in
the
draft
jurisdictional
convention
which
required
the
submission
of
the
criminal
code
of

this
notification

,

,
accompanied
with
an
assurance
of
japan
's
intention
to
continue
the
work
of
revision

notwithstanding

been
adopted

proclamation
wa
duly
made
on
the
9th
day
of
november
,
1887
,
of
the
conventional
extension
of
the
treaty
of
june
3
,
1875
,
with
hawaii
,
under
which
relation
of
such
special
and
beneficent
intercourse
have
been
created
.
in
the
vast
field
of
oriental
commerce
now
unfolded
from
our
pacific
border
no
feature
present
stronger
recommendation
for
congressional
action
than
the
establishment
of
communication
by
submarine
telegraph
with
honolulu
.
the
geographical
position
of
the
hawaiian
group
in
relation
to
our
pacific
state
creates
a
natural
interdependency
and
mutuality
of
interest
which
our
present
treaty
were
intended
to
foster
,
and
which
make
close
communication
a
logical
and
commercial
necessity
.
the
wisdom
of
concluding
a
treaty
of
commercial
reciprocity
with
mexico
ha
been
heretofore
stated
in
my
message
to
congress
,
and
the
lapse
of
time
and
growth
of
commerce
with
that
close
neighbor
and
sister
republic
confirm
the
judgment
so
expressed
.
the
precise
relocation
of
our
boundary
line
is
needful
,
and
adequate
appropriation
is
now
recommended
.
it
is
with
sincere
satisfaction
that
i
am
enabled
to
advert
to
the
spirit
of
good
neighborhood
and
friendly
cooperation
and
conciliation
that
ha
marked
the
correspondence
and
action
of
the
mexican
authority
in
their
share
of
the
task
of
maintaining
law
and
order
about
the
line
of
our
common
boundary
.
the
long-pending
boundary
dispute
between
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
wa
referred
to
my
arbitration
,
and
by
an
award
made
on
the
22d
of
march
last
the
question
ha
been
finally
settled
to
the
expressed
satisfaction
of
both
of
the
party
in
interest
.
the
empire
of
brazil
,
in
abolishing
the
last
vestige
of
slavery
among
christian
nation
,
called
forth
the
earnest
congratulation
of
this
government
in
expression
of
the
cordial
sympathy
of
our
people
.
the
claim
of
nearly
all
other
country
against
chile
growing
out
of
her
late
war
with
bolivia
and
peru
have
been
disposed
of
,
either
by
arbitration
or
by
a
lump
settlement
.
similar
claim
of
our
citizen
will
continue
to
be
urged
upon
the
chilean
government
,
and
it
is
hoped
will
not
be
subject
to
further
delay
.
a
comprehensive
treaty
of
amity
and
commerce
with
peru
wa
proclaimed
on
november
7
last
,
and
it
is
expected
that
under
it
operation
mutual
prosperity
and
good
understanding
will
be
promoted
.
in
pursuance
of
the
policy
of
arbitration
,
a
treaty
to
settle
the
claim
of
santos
,
an
american
citizen
,
against
ecuador
ha
been
concluded
under
my
authority
,
and
will
be
duly
submitted
for
the
approval
of
the
senate
.
like
disposition
of
the
claim
of
carlos
butterfield
against
denmark
and
of
van
bokkelen
against
hayti
will
probably
be
made
,
and
i
trust
the
principle
of
such
settlement
may
be
extended
in
practice
under
the
approval
of
the
senate
.
through
unforeseen
cause
,
foreign
to
the
will
of
both
government
,
the
ratification
of
the
convention
of
december
5
,
1885
,
with
venezuela
,
for
the
rehearing
of
claim
of
citizen
of
the
united
state
under
the
treaty
of
1866
,
failed
of
exchange
within
the
term
provided
,
and
a
supplementary
convention
,
further
extending
the
time
for
exchange
of
ratification
and
explanatory
of
an
ambiguous
provision
of
the
prior
convention
,
now
awaits
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
.
although
this
matter
,
in
the
stage
referred
to
,
concern
only
the
concurrent
treaty-making
power
of
one
branch
of
congress
,
i
advert
to
it
in
view
of
the
interest
repeatedly
and
conspicuously
shown
by
you
in
your
legislative
capacity
in
favor
of
a
speedy
and
equitable
adjustment
of
the
question
growing
out
of
the
discredited
judgment
of
the
previous
mixed
commission
of
caracas
.
with
every
desire
to
do
justice
to
the
representation
of
venezuela
in
this
regard
,
the
time
seems
to
have
come
to
end
this
matter
,
and
i
trust
the
prompt
confirmation
by
both
party
of
the
supplementary
action
referred
to
will
avert
the
need
of
legislative
or
other
action
to
prevent
the
longer
withholding
of
such
right
of
actual
claimant
a
may
be
shown
to
exist
.
a
authorized
by
the
congress
,
preliminary
step
have
been
taken
for
the
assemblage
at
this
capital
during
the
coming
year
of
the
representative
of
south
and
central
american
state
,
together
with
those
of
mexico
,
hayti
,
and
san
domingo
,
to
discus
sundry
important
monetary
and
commercial
topic
.
excepting
in
those
case
where
,
from
reason
of
contiguity
of
territory
and
the
existence
of
a
common
border
line
incapable
of
being
guarded
,
reciprocal
commercial
treaty
may
be
found
expedient
,
it
is
believed
that
commercial
policy
inducing
freer
mutual
exchange
of
product
can
be
most
advantageously
arranged
by
independent
but
cooperative
legislation
.
in
the
mode
last
mentioned
the
control
of
our
taxation
for
revenue
will
be
always
retained
in
our
own
hand
unrestricted
by
conventional
agreement
with
other
government
.
in
conformity
also
with
congressional
authority
,
the
maritime
power
have
been
invited
to
confer
in
washington
in
april
next
upon
the
practicability
of
devising
uniform
rule
and
measure
for
the
greater
security
of
life
and
property
at
sea
.
a
disposition
to
accept
on
the
part
of
a
number
of
the
power
ha
already
been
manifested
,
and
if
the
cooperation
of
the
nation
chiefly
interested
shall
be
secured
important
result
may
be
confidently
anticipated
.
the
act
of
june
26
,
1884
,
and
the
act
amendatory
thereof
,
in
relation
to
tonnage
duty
,
have
given
rise
to
extended
correspondence
with
foreign
nation
with
whom
we
have
existing
treaty
of
navigation
and
commerce
,
and
have
caused
wide
and
regrettable
divergence
of
opinion
in
relation
to
the
imposition
of
the
duty
referred
to
.
these
question
are
important
,
and
i
shall
make
them
the
subject
of
a
special
and
more
detailed
communication
at
the
present
session
.
with
the
rapid
increase
of
immigration
to
our
shore
and
the
facility
of
modern
travel
,
abuse
of
the
generous
privilege
afforded
by
our
naturalization
law
call
for
their
careful
revision
.
the
easy
and
unguarded
manner
in
which
certificate
of
american
citizenship
can
now
be
obtained
ha
induced
a
class
,
unfortunately
large
,
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
become
absolved
from
allegiance
to
their
native
land
,
and
yet
by
a
foreign
residence
to
escape
any
just
duty
and
contribution
of
service
to
the
country
of
their
proposed
adoption
.
thus
,
while
evading
the
duty
of
citizenship
to
the
united
state
,
they
may
make
prompt
claim
for
it
national
protection
and
demand
it
intervention
in
their
behalf
.
international
complication
of
a
serious
nature
arise
,
and
the
correspondence
of
the
state
department
discloses
the
great
number
and
complexity
of
the
question
which
have
been
raised
.
our
law
regulating
the
issue
of
passport
should
be
carefully
revised
,
and
the
institution
of
a
central
bureau
of
registration
at
the
capital
is
again
strongly
recommended
.
by
this
mean
full
particular
of
each
case
of
naturalization
in
the
united
state
would
be
secured
and
properly
indexed
and
recorded
,
and
thus
many
case
of
spurious
citizenship
would
be
detected
and
unjust
responsibility
would
be
avoided
.
the
reorganization
of
the
consular
service
is
a
matter
of
serious
importance
to
our
national
interest
.
the
number
of
existing
principal
consular
office
is
believed
to
be
greater
than
is
at
all
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
the
public
business
.
it
need
not
be
our
policy
to
maintain
more
than
a
moderate
number
of
principal
office
,
each
supported
by
a
salary
sufficient
to
enable
the
incumbent
to
live
in
comfort
,
and
so
distributed
a
to
secure
the
convenient
supervision
,
through
subordinate
agency
,
of
affair
over
a
considerable
district
.
i
repeat
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
by
me
that
the
appropriation
for
the
maintenance
of
our
diplomatic
and
consular
service
should
be
recast
;
that
the
so-called
notarial
or
unofficial
fee
,
which
our
representative
abroad
are
now
permitted
to
treat
a
personal
perquisite
,
should
be
forbidden
;
that
a
system
of
consular
inspection
should
be
instituted
,
and
that
a
limited
number
of
secretary
of
legation
at
large
should
be
authorized
.

,
have
been
made
by
a
voluntary
organization
of
the

of

and
believing
that
an
opportunity
should
be
afforded
for
the
expression
of
the
interest
felt
throughout
the
country
in
this
event
,
i
respectfully
recommend
fitting
and
cooperative
action
by
congress
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
united
state
.
the
report
of
the

in
detail
the
condition
of
our
national
finance
and
the
operation
of
the
several
branch
of
the
government
related

his
department
.
the

purpose
in

and
the

.
the
foregoing
statement
of
surplus
do
not
take
into
account
the
sum
necessary
to
be
expended
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
sinking-fund
act
,
amounting
to
more
than
$
47,000,000
annually
.
the
cost
of
collecting
the
custom
revenue
for
the
last
fiscal
year
wa
2.44
per
cent
;
for
the
year
1885
it
wa
3.77
per

.
the
excess
of

tax
collected
during
the
last
fiscal
year
over
those
collected
for
the
year
ended
june
30
,

,
and
the
cost
of

revenue
decreased
from
3.4
per
cent
in
1887
to
le
than
3.2
per

for

the

for

for

the
requirement
of
the
sinking-fund
act
have
been
met
for
the
year
ended
june
30
,
1888
,
and
for
the
current
year
also
,
by
the
purchase
of
bond
.
after
complying
with
this
law
a
positively
required
,
and
bond
sufficient
for
that
purpose
had
been
bought
at
a
premium
,
it
wa
not
deemed
prudent
to
further
expend
the
surplus
in
such
purchase
until
the
authority
to
do
so
should
be
more
explicit
.
a
resolution
,
however
,
having
been
passed
by
both
house
of
congress
removing
all
doubt
a
to
executive
authority
,
daily
purchase
of
bond
were
commenced
on
the
23d
day
of
april
,
1888
,
and
have
continued
until
the
present
time
.
by
this
plan
bond
of
the
government
not
yet
due
have
been
purchased
up
to
and
including
the
30th
day
of
november
,
1888
,
amounting
to
$
94,700,400
,
the
premium
paid
thereon
amounting
to
$
17,508,613.08
.
the
premium
added
to
the
principal
of
these
bond
represents
an
investment
yielding
about
2
per
cent
interest
for
the
time
they
still
had
to
run
,
and
the
saving
to
the
government
represented
by
the
difference
between
the
amount
of
interest
at
2
per
cent
upon
the
sum
paid
for
principal
and
premium
and
what
it
would
have
paid
for
interest
at
the
rate
specified
in
the
bond
if
they
had
run
to
their
maturity
is
about
$
27,165,000
.
at
first
sight
this
would
seem
to
be
a
profitable
and
sensible
transaction
on
the
part
of
the
government
,
but
,
a
suggested
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
,
the
surplus
thus
expended
for
the
purchase
of
bond
wa
money
drawn
from
the
people
in
excess
of
any
actual
need
of
the
government
and
wa
so
expended
rather
than
allow
it
to
remain
idle
in
the
treasury
.
if
this
surplus
,
under
the
operation
of
just
and
equitable
law
,
had
been
left
in
the
hand
of
the
people
,
it
would
have
been
worth
in
their
business
at
least
6
per
cent
per
annum
.
deducting
from
the
amount
of
interest
upon
the
principal
and
premium
of
these
bond
for
the
time
they
had
to
run
at
the
rate
of
6
per
cent
the
saving
of
2
per
cent
made
for
the
people
by
the
purchase
of
such
bond
,
the
loss
will
appear
to
be
$
55,760,000
.
this
calculation
would
seem
to
demonstrate
that
if
excessive
and
unnecessary
taxation
is
continued
and
the
government
is
forced
to
pursue
this
policy
of
purchasing
it
own
bond
at
the
premium
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
pay
,
the
loss
to
the
people
will
be
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
.
since
the
purchase
of
bond
wa
undertaken
a
mentioned
nearly
all
that
have
been
offered
were
at
last
accepted
.
it
ha
been
made
quite
apparent
that
the
government
wa
in
danger
of
being
subjected
to
combination
to
raise
their
price
,
a
appears
by
the
instance
cited
by
the
secretary
of
the
offering
of
bond
of
the
par
value
of
only
$
326,000
so
often
that
the
aggregate
of
the
sum
demanded
for
their
purchase
amounted
to
more
than
$
19,700,000
.
notwithstanding
the
large
sum
paid
out
in
the
purchase
of
bond
,
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
on
the
30th
day
of
november
,
1888
,
wa
$
52,234,610.01
,
after
deducting
about
$
20,000,000
just
drawn
out
for
the
payment
of
pension
.
at
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
30
,

there
had
been
coined
under
the
compulsory
silver-coinage
act

i
earnestly
request
that
the
recommendation
contained
in
the
secretary
's
report
,
all
of
which
are
,
in
my
opinion
,
calculated
to
increase
the
usefulness
and
discipline
of
the
army
,
may
receive
the
consideration
of
the
congress
.
among
these
the
proposal
that
there
should
be
provided
a
plan
for
the
examination
of
officer
to
test
their
fitness
for
promotion
is
of
the
utmost
importance
.
this
reform
ha
been
before
recommended
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
,
and
it
expediency
is
so
fully
demonstrated
by
the
argument
he
present
in
it
favor
that
it
adoption
should
no
longer
be
neglected
.
the
death
of
general
sheridan
in
august
last
wa
a
national
affliction
.
the
army
then
lost
the
grandest
of
it
chief
.
the
country
lost
a
brave
and
experienced
soldier
,
a
wise
and
discreet
counselor
,
and
a
modest
and
sensible
man
.
those
who
in
any
manner
came
within
the
range
of
his
personal
association
will
never
fail
to
pay
deserved
and
willing
homage
to
his
greatness
and
the
glory
of
his
career
,
but
they
will
cherish
with
more
tender
sensibility
the
loving
memory
of
his
simple
,
generous
,
and
considerate
nature
.

bloody
and
murderous
raid
during

,
a
they
arrive
at
a
suitable
age
,
are
sent
to
the
indian
school
at
carlisle
and
hampton
.
last
summer
some
charitable
and
kind
people
asked
permission
to
send
two
teacher
to
these
indian
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
adult
a
well
a
such
child
a
should
be
found
there
.
such
permission
wa
readily
granted
,
accommodation
were
provided
for
the
teacher
,
and
some
portion
of
the
building
at
the
barrack
were
made
available
for
school
purpose
.
the
good
work
contemplated
ha
been
commenced
,
and
the
teacher
engaged
are
paid
by
the
lady
with
whom
the
plan
originated
.
i
am
not
at
all
in
sympathy
with
those
benevolent
but
injudicious
people
who
are
constantly
insisting
that
these
indian
should
be
returned
to
their
reservation
.
their
removal
wa
an
absolute
necessity
if
the
life
and
property
of
citizen
upon
the
frontier
are
to
be
at
all
regarded
by
the
government
.
their
continued
restraint
at
a
distance
from
the
scene
of
their
repeated
and
cruel
murder
and
outrage
is
still
necessary
.
it
is
a
mistaken
philanthropy
,
every
way
injurious
,
which
prompt
the
desire
to
see
these
savage
returned
to
their
old
haunt
.
they
are
in
their
present
location
a
the
result
of
the
best
judgment
of
those
having
official
responsibility
in
the
matter
,
and
who
are
by
no
mean
lacking
in
kind
consideration
for
the
indian
.
a
number
of
these
prisoner
have
forfeited
their
life
to
outraged
law
and
humanity
.
experience
ha
proved
that
they
are
dangerous
and
can
not
be
trusted
.
this
is
true
not
only
of
those
who
on
the
warpath
have
heretofore
actually
been
guilty
of
atrocious
murder
,
but
of
their
kindred
and
friend
,
who
,
while
they
remained
upon
their
reservation
,
furnished
aid
and
comfort
to
those
absent
with
bloody
intent
.
these
prisoner
should
be
treated
kindly
and
kept
in
restraint
far
from
the
locality
of
their
former
reservation
;
they
should
be
subjected
to
effort
calculated
to
lead
to
their
improvement
and
the
softening
of
their
savage
and
cruel
instinct
,
but
their
return
to
their
old
home
should
be
persistently
resisted
.
the
secretary
in
his
report
give
a
graphic
history
of
these
indian
,
and
recites
with
painful
vividness
their
bloody
deed
and
the
unhappy
failure
of
the
government
to
manage
them
by
peaceful
mean
.
it
will
be
amazing
if
a
perusal
of
this
history
will
allow
the
survival
of
a
desire
for
the
return
of
these
prisoner
to
their
reservation
upon
sentimental
or
any
other
ground
.
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
demonstrates
very
intelligent
management
in
that
important
department
,
and
discloses
the
most
satisfactory
progress
in
the
work
of
reconstructing
the
navy
made
during
the
past
year
.
of
the
ship
in
course
of
construction
five
,
viz
,
the
charleston
,
baltimore
,
yorktown
,
vesuvius
,
and
the
petrel
,
have
in
that
time
been
launched
and
are
rapidly
approaching
completion
;
and
in
addition
to
the
above
,
the
philadelphia
,
the
san
francisco
,
the
newark
,
the
bennington
,
the
concord
,
and
the
herreshoff
torpedo
boat
are
all
under
contract
for
delivery
to
the
department
during
the
next
year
.
the
progress
already
made
and
being
made
give
good
ground
for
the
expectation
that
these
eleven
vessel
will
be
incorporated
a
part
of
the
american
navy
within
the
next
twelve
month
.
the
report
show
that
notwithstanding
the
large
expenditure
for
new
construction
and
the
additional
labor
they
involve
the
total
ordinary
or
current
expenditure
of
the
department
for
the
three
year
ending
june
30
,
1888
,
are
le
by
more
than
20
per
cent
than
such
expenditure
for
the
three
year
ending
june
30
,
1884
.
the
various
step
which
have
been
taken
to
improve
the
business
method
of
the
department
are
reviewed
by
the
secretary
.
the
purchasing
of
supply
ha
been
consolidated
and
placed
under
a
responsible
bureau
head
.
this
ha
resulted
in
the
curtailment
of
open
purchase
,
which
in
the
year
1884
and
1885
amounted
to
over
50
per
cent
of
all
the
purchase
of
the
department
,
to
le
than
11
per
cent
;
so
that
at
the
present
time
about
90
per
cent
of
the
total
departmental
purchase
are
made
by
contract
and
after
competition
.
a
the
expenditure
on
this
account
exceed
an
average
of
$
2,000,000
annually
,
it
is
evident
that
an
important
improvement
in
the
system
ha
been
inaugurated
and
substantial
economy
introduced
.
the
report
of
the
postmaster-general
show
a
marked
increase
of
business
in
every
branch
of
the
postal
service
.
the
number
of
post-offices
on
july

ha
been
an
increase

,
and
in
the
number

an
increase

the
estimated

6,000

,
but
the
amount
of
new

service
actually
put

.
the
volume
of
business
in

division
,
including

reached
the
sum
of
upward
of

during

parcel-post
convention
have
been
concluded
with

,
british
honduras
,
and
mexico
,
and
are
now
under
negotiation
with
all
the
central
and
south
american
state
.
the
increase
of
correspondence
with
foreign
country
during
the
past
three
year
is
gratifying
,
and
is
especially
notable
and
exceptional
with
the
central
and
south
american
state
and
with
mexico
.
a
the
greater
part
of
mail
matter
exchanged
with
these
country
is
commercial
in
it
character
,
this
increase
is
evidence
of
the
improved
business
relation
with
them
.
the
practical
operation
of
the
parcel-post
convention
,
so
far
a
negotiated
,
ha
served
to
fulfill
the
most
favorable
prediction
a
to
their
benefit
.
in
january
last
a
general
postal
convention
wa
negotiated
with
the
dominion
of
canada
,
which
went
into
operation
on
march
1
,
and
which
practically
make
one
postal
territory
of
the
united
state
and
canada
.
under
it
merchandise
parcel
may
now
be
transmitted
through
the
mail
at
fourth-class
rate
of
postage
.
it
is
not
possible
here
to
touch
even
the
leading
head
of
the
great
postal
establishment
to
illustrate
the
enormous
and
rapid
growth
of
it
business
and
the
need
for
legislative
readjustment
of
much
of
it
machinery
that
it
ha
outgrown
.
for
these
and
valuable
recommendation
of
the
postmaster-general
attention
is
earnestly
invited
to
his
report
.
a
department
whose
revenue
have
increased
from
$
19,772,000
in
1870
to
$
52,700,000
in
1888
,
despite
reduction
of
postage
which
have
enormously
reduced
rate
of
revenue
while
greatly
increasing
it
business
,
demand
the
careful
consideration
of
the
congress
a
to
all
matter
suggested
by
those
familiar
with
it
operation
,
and
which
are
calculated
to
increase
it
efficiency
and
usefulness
.
a
bill
proposed
by
the
postmaster-general
wa
introduced
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
by
which
a
uniform
standard
in
the
amount
of
gross
receipt
would
fix
the
right
of
a
community
to
a
public
building
to
be
erected
by
the
government
for
post-office
purpose
.
it
wa
demonstrated
that
,
aside
from
the
public
convenience
and
the
promotion
of
harmony
among
citizen
,
invariably
disturbed
by
change
of
leasings
and
of
site
,
it
wa
a
measure
of
the
highest
economy
and
of
sound
business
judgment
.
it
wa
found
that
the
government
wa
paying
in
rent
at
the
rate
of
from
7
to
10
per
cent
per
annum
on
what
the
cost
of
such
public
building
would
be
.
a
very
great
advantage
resulting
from
such
a
law
would
be
the
prevention
of
a
large
number
of
bill
constantly
introduced
for
the
erection
of
public
building
at
place
,
and
involving
expenditure
not
justified
by
public
necessity
.
i
trust
that
this
measure
will
become
a
law
at
the
present
session
of
congress
.
of
the
total
number
of
postmaster
54,874
are
of
the
fourth
class
.
these
,
of
course
,
receive
no
allowance
whatever
for
expense
in
the
service
,
and
their
compensation
is
fixed
by
percentage
on
receipt
at
their
respective
office
.
this
rate
of
compensation
may
have
been
,
and
probably
wa
,
at
some
time
just
,
but
the
standard
ha
remained
unchanged
through
the
several
reduction
in
the
rate
of
postage
.
such
reduction
have
necessarily
cut
down
the
compensation
of
these
official
,
while
it
undoubtedly
increased
the
business
performed
by
them
.
simple
justice
requires
attention
to
this
subject
,
to
the
end
that
fourth-class
postmaster
may
receive
at
least
an
equivalent
to
that
which
the
law
itself
,
fixing
the
rate
,
intended
for
them
.
another
class
of

i
call
especial
attention
to
the
repeated
recommendation
of
the
postmaster-general
for
their
classification
.

legislation
of
this
character
for
the

of

and
limiting
their
hour
of

.
seven
million
dollar
ha
been
appropriated
for
the
current
year
to
provide
for
them
,
though
the
total
number
of
office
where
they
are
employed
is
but
358
for
the
past
fiscal
year
,
with
an
estimated
increase
for
the
current
year
of
but
40
,
while
the
total
appropriation
for

is

5,950,000
.
the
legislation
affecting
the
relation
of
the
government
with
railroad
is
in
need
of
revision
.
while
for
the
most
part
the
railroad
company
throughout
the
country
have
cordially
cooperated
with
the
post-office
department
in
rendering
excellent
service
,
yet
under
the
law
a
it
stand
,
while
the
compensation
to
them
for
carrying
the
mail
is
limited
and
regulated
,
and
although
railroad
are
made
post-roads
by
law
,
there
is
no
authority
reposed
anywhere
to
compel
the
owner
of
a
railroad
to
take
and
carry
the
united
state
mail
.
the
only
alternative
provided
by
act
of
congress
in
case
of
refusal
is
for
the
postmaster-general
to
send
mail
forward
by
pony
express
.
this
is
but
an
illustration
of
ill-fitting
legislation
,
reasonable
and
proper
at
the
time
of
it
enactment
,
but
long
since
outgrown
and
requiring
readjustment
.
it
is
gratifying
to
note
from
the
carefully
prepared
statistic
accompanying
the
postmaster-general
's
report
that
notwithstanding
the
great
expansion
of
the
service
the
rate
of
expenditure
ha
been
lessened
and
efficiency
ha
been
improved
in
every
branch
;
that
fraud
and
crime
have
decreased
;
that
loss
from
the
mail
have
been
reduced
,
and
that
the
number
of
complaint
of
the
service
made
to
postmaster
and
to
the
department
are
far
le
than
ever
before
.
the
transaction
of
the
department
of
justice
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
30
,
1888
,
are
contained
in
the
report
of
the
attorney-general
,
a
well
a
a
number
of
valuable
recommendation
,
the
most
part
of
which
are
repetition
of
those
previously
made
,
and
ought
to
receive
consideration
.
it
is
stated
in
this
report
that
though
judgment
in
civil
suit
amounting
to
$
552,021.08
were
recovered
in
favor
of
the
government
during
the
year
,
only
the
sum
of
$
132,934
wa
collected
thereon
;
and
that
though
fine
,
penalty
,
and
forfeiture
were
imposed
amounting
to
$
541,808.43
,
only
$
109,648.42
of
that
sum
wa
paid
on
account
thereof
.
these
fact
may
furnish
an
illustration
of
the
sentiment
which
extensively
prevails
that
a
debt
due
the
government
should
cause
no
inconvenience
to
the
citizen
.
it
also
appears
from
this
report
that
though
prior
to
march
,
1885
,
there
had
been
but
6
conviction
in
the
territory
of
utah
and
idaho
under
the
law
of
1862
and
1882
,
punishing
polygamy
and
unlawful
cohabitation
a
crime
,
there
have
been
since
that
date
nearly
600
conviction
under
these
law
and
the
statute
of
1887
;
and
the
opinion
is
expressed
that
under
such
a
firm
and
vigilant
execution
of
these
law
and
the
advance
of
idea
opposed
to
the
forbidden
practice
polygamy
within
the
united
state
is
virtually
at
an
end
.

instituted

resulted
in
a
decree
favorable
to
the

,
declaring
the

.
such
property
,
amounting
in
value
to
more
than

800,000
,
is
in
the
hand
of
a
receiver
pending
further
proceeding

appeal
having
been
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of

in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
,
which
will
be
laid
before
you
,
the
condition
of
the
various
branch
of
our
domestic
affair
connected
with
that
department
and
it
operation
during
the
past
year
are
fully
exhibited
.
but
a
brief
reference
to
some
of
the
subject
discussed
in
this
able
and
interesting
report
can
here
be
made
;
but
i
commend
the
entire
report
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
,
and
trust
that
the
sensible
and
valuable
recommendation
it
contains
will
secure
careful
consideration
.
i
can
not
too
strenuously
insist
upon
the
importance
of
proper
measure
to
insure
a
right
disposition
of
our
public
land
,
not
only
a
a
matter
of
present
justice
,
but
in
forecast
of
the
consequence
to
future
generation
.
the
broad
,
rich
acre
of
our
agricultural
plain
have
been
long
preserved
by
nature
to
become
her
untrammeled
gift
to
a
people
civilized
and
free
,
upon
which
should
rest
in
well-distributed
ownership
the
numerous
home
of
enlightened
,
equal
,
and
fraternal
citizen
.
they
came
to
national
possession
with
the
warning
example
in
our
eye
of
the
entail
of
iniquity
in
landed
proprietorship
which
other
country
have
permitted
and
still
suffer
.
we
have
no
excuse
for
the
violation
of
principle
cogently
taught
by
reason
and
example
,
nor
for
the
allowance
of
pretext
which
have
sometimes
exposed
our
land
to
colossal
greed
.
law
which
open
a
door
to
fraudulent
acquisition
,
or
administration
which
permit
favor
to
rapacious
seizure
by
a
favored
few
of
expanded
area
that
many
should
enjoy
,
are
accessory
to
offense
against
our
national
welfare
and
humanity
not
to
be
too
severely
condemned
or
punished
.
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
something
ha
been
done
at
last
to
redress
the
injury
to
our
people
and
check
the
perilous
tendency
of
the
reckless
waste
of
the
national
domain
.
that
over
80,000,000
acre
have
been
arrested
from
illegal
usurpation
,
improvident
grant
,
and
fraudulent
entry
and
claim
,
to
be
taken
for
the
homestead
of
honest
industry
--
although
le
than
the
greater
area
thus
unjustly
lost
--
must
afford
a
profound
gratification
to
right-feeling
citizen
,
a
it
is
a
recompense
for
the
labor
and
struggle
of
the
recovery
.
our
dear
experience
ought
sufficiently
to
urge
the
speedy
enactment
of
measure
of
legislation
which
will
confine
the
future
disposition
of
our
remaining
agricultural
land
to
the
us
of
actual
husbandry
and
genuine
home
.
nor
should
our
vast
tract
of
so-called
desert
land
be
yielded
up
to
the
monopoly
of
corporation
or
grasping
individual
,
a
appears
to
be
much
the
tendency
under
the
existing
statute
.
these
land
require
but
the
supply
of
water
to
become
fertile
and
productive
.
it
is
a
problem
of
great
moment
how
most
wisely
for
the
public
good
that
factor
shall
be
furnished
.
i
can
not
but
think
it
perilous
to
suffer
either
these
land
or
the
source
of
their
irrigation
to
fall
into
the
hand
of
monopoly
,
which
by
such
mean
may
exercise
lordship
over
the
area
dependent
on
their
treatment
for
productiveness
.
already
step
have
been
taken
to
secure
accurate
and
scientific
information
of
the
condition
,
which
is
the
prime
basis
of
intelligent
action
.
until
this
shall
be
gained
the
course
of
wisdom
appears
clearly
to
lie
in
a
suspension
of
further
disposal
,
which
only
promise
to
create
right
antagonistic
to
the
common
interest
.
no
harm
can
follow
this
cautionary
conduct
.
the
land
will
remain
,
and
the
public
good
present
no
demand
for
hasty
dispossession
of
national
ownership
and
control
.
i
commend
also
the
recommendation
that
appropriate
measure
be
taken
to
complete
the
adjustment
of
the
various
grant
made
to
the
state
for
internal
improvement
and
of
swamp
and
overflowed
land
,
a
well
a
to
adjudicate
and
finally
determine
the
validity
and
extent
of
the
numerous
private
land
claim
.
all
these
are
element
of
great
injustice
and
peril
to
the
settler
upon
the
locality
affected
;
and
now
that
their
existence
can
not
be
avoided
,
no
duty
is
more
pressing
than
to
fix
a
soon
a
possible
their
bound
and
terminate
the
threat
of
trouble
which
arise
from
uncertainty
.
the
condition
of
our
indian
population
continues
to
improve
and
the
proof
multiply
that
the
transforming
change
,
so
much
to
be
desired
,
which
shall
substitute
for
barbarism
enlightenment
and
civilizing
education
,
is
in
favorable
progress
.
our
relation
with
these
people
during
the
year
have
been
disturbed
by
no
serious
disorder
,
but
rather
marked
by
a
better
realization
of
their
true
interest
and
increasing
confidence
and
good
will
.
these
condition
testify
to
the
value
of
the
higher
tone
of
consideration
and
humanity
which
ha
governed
the
later
method
of
dealing
with
them
,
and
commend
it
continued
observance
.
allotment
in
severalty
have
been
made
on
some
reservation
until
all
those
entitled
to
land
thereon
have
had
their
share
assigned
,
and
the
work
is
still
continued
.
in
directing
the
execution
of
this
duty
i
have
not
aimed
so
much
at
rapid
dispatch
a
to
secure
just
and
fair
arrangement
which
shall
best
conduce
to
the
object
of
the
law
by
producing
satisfaction
with
the
result
of
the
allotment
made
.
no
measure
of
general
effect
ha
ever
been
entered
on
from
which
more
may
be
fairly
hoped
if
it
shall
be
discreetly
administered
.
it
proffer
opportunity
and
inducement
to
that
independence
of
spirit
and
life
which
the
indian
peculiarly
need
,
while
at
the
same
time
the
inalienability
of
title
affords
security
against
the
risk
his
inexperience
of
affair
or
weakness
of
character
may
expose
him
to
in
dealing
with
others
.
whenever
begun
upon
any
reservation
it
should
be
made
complete
,
so
that
all
are
brought
to
the
same
condition
,
and
a
soon
a
possible
community
in

should
cease
by

contact
with
the
way
of
industrious
and
successful
farmer
will
perhaps
add
a
healthy
emulation
which
will
both
instruct
and
stimulate
.
but
no
agency
for
the
amelioration
of
this
people
appears
to
me
so
promising
a
the
extension
,
urged
by
the
secretary
,
of
such
complete

at
the
earliest
possible
day
embrace
all
teachable
indian
youth
,
of
both

and
retain
them
with
a
kindly
and
beneficent
hold
until
their
character
are
formed
and
their
faculty
and
disposition
trained
to
the
sure
pursuit
of
some
form
of
useful
industry
.

of
the
indian
no
longer
need
demonstration
.
it
is
established
.
it
remains
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
and
when
that
shall
be
done
the
curse
will
be
lifted
,
the
indian
race
saved
,
and
the
sin
of
their
oppression
redeemed
.
the
time
of
it
accomplishment
depends
upon
the
spirit
and
justice
with
which
it
shall
be
prosecuted
.
it
can
not
be
too
soon
for
the
indian
nor
for
the
interest
and
good
name
of
the
nation
.
the
average
attendance
of
indian
pupil
on
the
school
increased
by
over
900
during
the
year
,
and
the
total
enrollment
reached
15,212
.
the
cost
of
maintenance
wa
not
materially
raised
.
the
number
of
teachable
indian
youth
is
now
estimated
at
40,000
,
or
nearly
three
time
the
enrollment
of
the
school
.
it
is
believed
the
obstacle
in
the
way
of
instructing
are
all
surmountable
,
and
that
the
necessary
expenditure
would
be
a
measure
of
economy
.
the
sioux
tribe
on
the
great
reservation
of
dakota
refused
to
assent
to
the
act
passed
by
the
congress
at
it
last
session
for
opening
a
portion
of
their
land
to
settlement
,
notwithstanding
modification
of
the
term
wa
suggested
which
met
most
of
their
objection
.
their
demand
is
for
immediate
payment
of
the
full
price
of
$
1.25
per
acre
for
the
entire
body
of
land
the
occupancy
of
which
they
are
asked
to
relinquish
.
the
manner
of
submission
insured
their
fair
understanding
of
the
law
,
and
their
action
wa
undoubtedly
a
thoroughly
intelligent
a
their
capacity
admitted
.
it
is
at
least
gratifying
that
no
reproach
of
overreaching
can
in
any
manner
lie
against
the
government
,
however
advisable
the
favorable
completion
of
the
negotiation
may
have
been
esteemed
.
i
concur
in
the
suggestion
of
the
secretary
regarding
the
turtle
mountain
indian
,
the
two
reservation
in
california
,
and
the
cree

they
should
,
in
my
opinion
,
receive
immediate
attention
.
the
number
of

added

to

per

.
the
amount
paid
for

during

78,775,861.92

being
an
increase
over

i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
our
general
pension
law
should
be
revised
and
adjusted
to
meet
a
far
a
possible
,
in
the
light
of
our
experience
,
all
meritorious
case
.
the
fact
that
102
different
rate
of
pension
are
paid
can
not
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
made
consistent
with
justice
to
the
pensioner
or
to
the
government
;
and
the
numerous
private
pension
bill
that
are
passed
,
predicated
upon
the
imperfection
of
general
law
,
while
they
increase
in
many
case
existing
inequality
and
injustice
,
lend
additional
force
to
the
recommendation
for
a
revision
of
the
general
law
on
this
subject
.
the
laxity
of
idea
prevailing
among
a
large
number
of
our
people
regarding
pension
is
becoming
every
day
more
marked
.
the
principle
upon
which
they
should
be
granted
are
in
danger
of
being
altogether
ignored
,
and
already
pension
are
often
claimed
because
the
applicant
are
a
much
entitled
a
other
successful
applicant
,
rather
than
upon
any
disability
reasonably
attributable
to
military
service
.
if
the
establishment
of
vicious
precedent
be
continued
,
if
the
granting
of
pension
be
not
divorced
from
partisan
and
other
unworthy
and
irrelevant
consideration
,
and
if
the
honorable
name
of
veteran
unfairly
becomes
by
these
mean
but
another
term
for
one
who
constantly
clamor
for
the
aid
of
the
government
,
there
is
danger
that
injury
will
be
done
to
the
fame
and
patriotism
of
many
whom
our
citizen
all
delight
to
honor
,
and
that
a
prejudice
will
be
aroused
unjust
to
meritorious
applicant
for
pension
.

four
year
ago
it
wa
found
that
the
great
cattle
industry
of
the
country
wa
endangered
,
and
those
engaged
in
it
were
alarmed
at
the
rapid
extension
of
the
european
lung
plague
of
pleuro-pneumonia
.
serious
outbreak
existed
in
illinois
,
missouri
,
and
kentucky
,
and
in
tennessee
animal
affected
were
held
in
quarantine
.
five
county
in
new
york
and
from
one
to
four
county
in
each
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
,
pennsylvania
,
delaware
,
and
maryland
were
almost
equally
affected
.
with
this
great
danger
upon
u
and
with
the
contagion
already
in
the
channel
of
commerce
,
with
the
enormous
direct
and
indirect
loss
already
being
caused
by
it
,
and
when
only
prompt
and
energetic
action
could
be
successful
,
there
were
in
none
of
these
state
any
law
authorizing
this
department
to
eradicate
the
malady
or
giving
the
state
official
power
to
cooperate
with
it
for
this
purpose
.
the
department
even
lacked
both
the
requisite
appropriation
and
authority
.
by
securing
state
cooperation
in
connection
with
authority
from
congress
the
work
of
eradication
ha
been
pressed
successfully
,
and
this
dreaded
disease
ha
been
extirpated
from
the
western
state
and
also
from
the
eastern
state
,
with
the
exception
of
a
few
restricted
area
,
which
are
still
under
supervision
.
the
danger
ha
thus
been
removed
,
and
trade
and
commerce
have
been
freed
from
the
vexatious
state
restriction
which
were
deemed
necessary
for
a
time
.
during
the
past
four
year
the
process
of
diffusion
,
a
applied
to
the
manufacture
of
sugar
from
sorghum
and
sugar
cane
,
ha
been
introduced
into
this
country
and
fully
perfected
by
the
experiment
carried
on
by
the
department
of
agriculture
.
this
process
is
now
universally
considered
to
be
the
most
economical
one
,
and
it
is
through
it
that
the
sorghum-sugar
industry
ha
been
established
upon
a
firm
basis
and
the
road
to
it
future
success
opened
.
the
adoption
of
this
diffusion
process
is
also
extending
in
louisiana
and
other
sugar-producing
part
of
the
country
,
and
will
doubtless
soon
be
the
only
method
employed
for
the
extraction
of
sugar
from
the
cane
.
an
exhaustive
study
ha
also
within
the
same
period
been
undertaken
of
the
subject
of
food
adulteration
and
the
best
analytical
method
for
detecting
it
.
a
part
of
the
result
of
this
work
ha
already
been
published
by
the
department
,
which
,
with
the
matter
in
course
of
preparation
,
will
make
the
most
complete
treatise
on
that
subject
that
ha
ever
been
published
in
any
country
.
the
department
seek
a
progressive
development
.
it
would
combine
the
discovery
of
science
with
the
economics
and
amelioration
of
rural
practice
.
a
supervision
of
the
endowed
experimental-station
system
recently
provided
for
is
a
proper
function
of
the
department
,
and
is
now
in
operation
.
this
supervision
is
very
important
,
and
should
be
wisely
and
vigilantly
directed
,
to
the
end
that
the
pecuniary
aid
of
the
government
in
favor
of
intelligent
agriculture
should
be
so
applied
a
to
result
in
the
general
good
and
to
the
benefit
of
all
our
people
,
thus
justifying
the
appropriation
made
from
the
public
treasury
.
the
adjustment
of
the
relation
between
the
government
and
the
railroad
company
which
have
received
land
grant
and
the
guaranty
of
the
public
credit
in
aid
of
the
construction
of
their
road
should
receive
early
attention
.
the
report
of
a
majority
of
the
commissioner
appointed
to
examine
the
affair
and
indebtedness
of
these
road
,
in
which
they
favor
an
extension
of
the
time
for
the
payment
of
such
indebtedness
in
at
least
one
case
where
the
corporation
appears
to
be
able
to
comply
with
well-guarded
and
exact
term
of
such
extension
,
and
the
reenforcement
of
their
opinion
by
gentleman
of
undoubted
business
judgment
and
experience
,
appointed
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
government
a
director
of
said
corporation
,
may
well
lead
to
the
belief
that
such
an
extension
would
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
government
.
the
subject
should
be
treated
a
a
business
proposition
with
a
view
to
a
final
realization
of
it
indebtedness
by
the
government
,
rather
than
a
a
question
to
be
decided
upon
prejudice
or
by
way
of
punishment
for
previous
wrongdoing
.
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
the
district
of
columbia
,
with
it
accompanying
document
,
give
in
detail
the
operation
of
the
several
department
of
the
district
government
,
and
furnishes
evidence
that
the
financial
affair
of
the
district
are
at
present
in
such
satisfactory
condition
a
to
justify
the
commissioner
in
submitting
to
the
congress
estimate
for
desirable
and
needed
improvement
.
the
commissioner
recommend
certain
legislation
which
in
their
opinion
is
necessary
to
advance
the
interest
of
the
district
.
i
invite
your
special
attention
to
their
request
for
such
legislation
a
will
enable
the
commissioner
without
delay
to
collect
,
digest
,
and
properly
arrange
the
law
by
which
the
district
is
governed
,
and
which
are
now
embraced
in
several
collection
,
making
them
available
only
with
great
difficulty
and
labor
.
the
suggestion
they
make
touching
desirable
amendment
to
the
law
relating
to
license
granted
for
carrying
on
the
retail
traffic
in
spirituous
liquor
,
to
the
observance
of
sunday
,
to
the
proper
assessment
and
collection
of
tax
,
to
the
speedy
punishment
of
minor
offender
,
and
to
the
management
and
control
of
the
reformatory
and
charitable
institution
supported
by
congressional
appropriation
are
commended
to
careful
consideration
.
i
again
call
attention
to
the
present
inconvenience
and
the
danger
to
life
and
property
attending
the
operation
of
steam
railroad
through
and
across
the
public
street
and
road
of
the
district
.
the
propriety
of
such
legislation
a
will
properly
guard
the
use
of
these
railroad
and
better
secure
the
convenience
and
safety
of
citizen
is
manifest
.
the
consciousness
that
i
have
presented
but
an
imperfect
statement
of
the
condition
of
our
country
and
it
want
occasion
no
fear
that
anything
omitted
is
not
known
and
appreciated
by
the
congress
,
upon
whom
rest
the
responsibility
of
intelligent
legislation
in
behalf
of
a
great
nation
and
a
confiding
people
.
a
public
servant
we
shall
do
our
duty
well
if
we
constantly
guard
the
rectitude
of
our
intention
,
maintain
unsullied
our
love
of
country
,
and
with
unselfish
purpose
strive
for
the
public
good
.
