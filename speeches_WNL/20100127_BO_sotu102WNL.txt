madam
speaker
,
vice
president
biden
,
member
of
congress
,
distinguished
guest
,
and
fellow
american
:
our
constitution
declares
that
from
time
to
time
,
the
president
shall
give
to
congress
information
about
the
state
of
our
union
.
for
220
year
,
our
leader
have
fulfilled
this
duty
.
they
've
done
so
during
period
of
prosperity
and
tranquility
,
and
they
've
done
so
in
the
midst
of
war
and
depression
,
at
moment
of
great
strife
and
great
struggle
.
it
's
tempting
to
look
back
on
these
moment
and
assume
that
our
progress
wa
inevitable
,
that
america
wa
always
destined
to
succeed
.
but
when
the
union
wa
turned
back
at
bull
run
and
the
ally
first
landed
at
omaha
beach
,
victory
wa
very
much
in
doubt
.
when
the
market
crashed
on
black
tuesday
and
civil
right
marcher
were
beaten
on
bloody
sunday
,
the
future
wa
anything
but
certain
.
these
were
the
time
that
tested
the
courage
of
our
conviction
and
the
strength
of
our
union
.
and
despite
all
our
division
and
disagreement
,
our
hesitation
and
our
fear
,
america
prevailed
because
we
chose
to
move
forward
a
one
nation
,
a
one
people
.
again
,
we
are
tested
.
and
again
,
we
must
answer
history
's
call
.
one
year
ago
,
i
took
office
amid
two
war
,
an
economy
rocked
by
a
severe
recession
,
a
financial
system
on
the
verge
of
collapse
,
and
a
government
deeply
in
debt
.
expert
from
across
the
political
spectrum
warned
that
if
we
did
not
act
,
we
might
face
a
second
depression
.
so
we
acted
,
immediately
and
aggressively
.
and
1
year
later
,
the
worst
of
the
storm
ha
passed
.
but
the
devastation
remains
.
one
in
10
american
still
can
not
find
work
.
many
business
have
shuttered
.
home
value
have
declined
.
small
town
and
rural
community
have
been
hit
especially
hard
.
and
for
those
who
'd
already
known
poverty
,
life
's
become
that
much
harder
.
this
recession
ha
also
compounded
the
burden
that
america
's
family
have
been
dealing
with
for
decade
:
the
burden
of
working
harder
and
longer
for
le
,
of
being
unable
to
save
enough
to
retire
or
help
kid
with
college
.
so
i
know
the
anxiety
that
are
out
there
right
now
.
they
're
not
new
.
these
struggle
are
the
reason
i
ran
for
president
.
these
struggle
are
what
i
've
witnessed
for
year
,
in
place
like
elkhart
,
indiana
;
galesburg
,
illinois
.
i
hear
about
them
in
the
letter
that
i
read
each
night
.
the
toughest
to
read
are
those
written
by
child
asking
why
they
have
to
move
from
their
home
,
asking
when
their
mom
or
dad
will
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
.
for
these
american
and
so
many
others
,
change
ha
not
come
fast
enough
.
some
are
frustrated
,
some
are
angry
.
they
do
n't
understand
why
it
seems
like
bad
behavior
on
wall
street
is
rewarded
,
but
hard
work
on
main
street
is
n't
,
or
why
washington
ha
been
unable
or
unwilling
to
solve
any
of
our
problem
.
they
're
tired
of
the
partisanship
and
the
shouting
and
the
pettiness
.
they
know
we
ca
n't
afford
it
.
not
now
.
so
we
face
big
and
difficult
challenge
.
and
what
the
american
people
hope
,
what
they
deserve
,
is
for
all
of
u
,
democrat
and
republican
,
to
work
through
our
difference
,
to
overcome
the
numbing
weight
of
our
politics
.
for
while
the
people
who
sent
u
here
have
different
background
,
different
story
,
different
belief
,
the
anxiety
they
face
are
the
same
.
the
aspiration
they
hold
are
shared
:
a
job
that
pay
the
bill
;
a
chance
to
get
ahead
;
most
of
all
,
the
ability
to
give
their
child
a
better
life
.
and
you
know
what
else
they
share
?
they
share
a
stubborn
resilience
in
the
face
of
adversity
.
after
one
of
the
most
difficult
year
in
our
history
,
they
remain
busy
building
car
and
teaching
kid
,
starting
business
and
going
back
to
school
.
they're
coaching
little
league
and
helping
their
neighbor
.
one
woman
wrote
to
me
and
said
,
``
we
are
strained
but
hopeful
,
struggling
but
encouraged
.
''
it
's
because
of
this
spirit
,
this
great
decency
and
great
strength
,
that
i
have
never
been
more
hopeful
about
america
's
future
than
i
am
tonight
.
despite
our
hardship
,
our
union
is
strong
.
we
do
not
give
up
.
we
do
not
quit
.
we
do
not
allow
fear
or
division
to
break
our
spirit
.
in
this
new
decade
,
it
's
time
the
american
people
get
a
government
that
match
their
decency
,
that
embodies
their
strength
.
and
tonight
i
'd
like
to
talk
about
how
together
we
can
deliver
on
that
promise
.
it
begin
with
our
economy
.
our
most
urgent
task
upon
taking
office
wa
to
shore
up
the
same
bank
that
helped
cause
this
crisis
.
it
wa
not
easy
to
do
.
and
if
there
's
one
thing
that
ha
unified
democrat
and
republican
and
everybody
in
between
,
it
's
that
we
all
hated
the
bank
bailout
.
i
hated
it
.
i
hated
it
;
you
hated
it
.
it
wa
about
a
popular
a
a
root
canal
.
but
when
i
ran
for
president
,
i
promised
i
would
n't
just
do
what
wa
popular
;
i
would
do
what
wa
necessary
.
and
if
we
had
allowed
the
meltdown
of
the
financial
system
,
unemployment
might
be
double
what
it
is
today
.
more
business
would
certainly
have
closed
.
more
home
would
have
surely
been
lost
.
so
i
supported
the
last
administration
's
effort
to
create
the
financial
rescue
program
.
and
when
we
took
that
program
over
,
we
made
it
more
transparent
and
more
accountable
.
and
a
a
result
,
the
market
are
now
stabilized
,
and
we
've
recovered
most
of
the
money
we
spent
on
the
banks—most
but
not
all
.
to
recover
the
rest
,
i
've
proposed
a
fee
on
the
biggest
bank
.
now
,
i
know
wall
street
is
n't
keen
on
this
idea
.
but
if
these
firm
can
afford
to
hand
out
big
bonus
again
,
they
can
afford
a
modest
fee
to
pay
back
the
taxpayer
who
rescued
them
in
their
time
of
need
.
now
,
a
we
stabilized
the
financial
system
,
we
also
took
step
to
get
our
economy
growing
again
,
save
a
many
job
a
possible
,
and
help
american
who
had
become
unemployed
.
that
's
why
we
extended
or
increased
unemployment
benefit
for
more
than
18
million
american
,
made
health
insurance
65
percent
cheaper
for
family
who
get
their
coverage
through
cobra
,
and
passed
25
different
tax
cut
.
now
,
let
me
repeat
:
we
cut
tax
.
we
cut
tax
for
95
percent
of
working
family
.
we
cut
tax
for
small
business
.
we
cut
tax
for
first-time
home
buyer
.
we
cut
tax
for
parent
trying
to
care
for
their
child
.
we
cut
tax
for
8
million
american
paying
for
college
.
i
thought
i
'd
get
some
applause
on
that
one
.
a
a
result
,
million
of
american
had
more
to
spend
on
gas
and
food
and
other
necessity
,
all
of
which
helped
business
keep
more
worker
.
and
we
have
n't
raised
income
tax
by
a
single
dime
on
a
single
person—not
a
single
dime
.
now
,
because
of
the
step
we
took
,
there
are
about
2
million
american
working
right
now
who
would
otherwise
be
unemployed
.
two
hundred
thousand
work
in
construction
and
clean
energy
.
three
hundred
thousand
are
teacher
and
other
education
worker
.
ten
of
thousand
are
cop
,
firefighter
,
correctional
officer
,
first-responders
.
and
we
're
on
track
to
add
another
1½
million
job
to
this
total
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
the
plan
that
ha
made
all
of
this
possible
,
from
the
tax
cut
to
the
job
,
is
the
recovery
act
.
that
's
right
,
the
recovery
act
,
also
known
a
the
stimulus
bill
.
economist
on
the
left
and
the
right
say
this
bill
ha
helped
save
job
and
avert
disaster
.
but
you
do
n't
have
to
take
their
word
for
it
.
talk
to
the
small
business
in
phoenix
that
will
triple
it
workforce
because
of
the
recovery
act
.
talk
to
the
window
manufacturer
in
philadelphia
who
said
he
used
to
be
skeptical
about
the
recovery
act
,
until
he
had
to
add
two
more
work
shift
just
because
of
the
business
it
created
.
talk
to
the
single
teacher
raising
two
kid
who
wa
told
by
her
principal
in
the
last
week
of
school
that
because
of
the
recovery
act
,
she
would
n't
be
laid
off
after
all
.
there
are
story
like
this
all
across
america
.
and
after
2
year
of
recession
,
the
economy
is
growing
again
.
retirement
fund
have
started
to
gain
back
some
of
their
value
.
business
are
beginning
to
invest
again
,
and
slowly
some
are
starting
to
hire
again
.
but
i
realize
that
for
every
success
story
,
there
are
other
story
,
of
men
and
woman
who
wake
up
with
the
anguish
of
not
knowing
where
their
next
paycheck
will
come
from
,
who
send
out
resume
week
after
week
and
hear
nothing
in
response
.
that
is
why
job
must
be
our
number-one
focus
in
2010
,
and
that
's
why
i
'm
calling
for
a
new
job
bill
tonight
.
now
,
the
true
engine
of
job
creation
in
this
country
will
always
be
america
's
business
.
i
agree
,
absolutely
.
but
government
can
create
the
condition
necessary
for
business
to
expand
and
hire
more
worker
.
we
should
start
where
most
new
job
do
,
in
small
business
,
company
that
begin
when
an
entrepreneur
take
a
chance
on
a
dream
or
a
worker
decides
it
's
time
she
became
her
own
bos
.
through
sheer
grit
and
determination
,
these
company
have
weathered
the
recession
,
and
they
're
ready
to
grow
.
but
when
you
talk
to
small-business
owner
in
place
like
allentown
,
pennsylvania
,
or
elyria
,
ohio
,
you
find
out
that
even
though
bank
on
wall
street
are
lending
again
,
they
're
mostly
lending
to
bigger
company
.
financing
remains
difficult
for
small-business
owner
across
the
country
,
even
those
that
are
making
a
profit
.
so
tonight
i
'm
proposing
that
we
take
$
30
billion
of
the
money
wall
street
bank
have
repaid
and
use
it
to
help
community
bank
give
small
business
the
credit
they
need
to
stay
afloat
.
i
'm
also
proposing
a
new
small
business
tax
credit
,
one
that
will
go
to
over
1
million
small
business
who
hire
new
worker
or
raise
wage
.
while
we
're
at
it
,
let
's
also
eliminate
all
capital
gain
tax
on
small-business
investment
and
provide
a
tax
incentive
for
all
large
business
and
all
small
business
to
invest
in
new
plant
and
equipment
.
next
,
we
can
put
american
to
work
today
building
the
infrastructure
of
tomorrow
.
from
the
first
railroad
to
the
interstate
highway
system
,
our
nation
ha
always
been
built
to
compete
.
there
's
no
reason
europe
or
china
should
have
the
fastest
train
or
the
new
factory
that
manufacture
clean
energy
product
.
tomorrow
i
'll
visit
tampa
,
florida
,
where
worker
will
soon
break
ground
on
a
new
high-speed
railroad
funded
by
the
recovery
act
.
there
are
project
like
that
all
across
this
country
that
will
create
job
and
help
move
our
nation
's
good
,
service
,
and
information
.
we
should
put
more
american
to
work
building
clean
energy
facility
and
give
rebate
to
american
who
make
their
home
more
energy
efficient
,
which
support
clean
energy
job
.
and
to
encourage
these
and
other
business
to
stay
within
our
border
,
it
is
time
to
finally
slash
the
tax
break
for
company
that
ship
our
job
overseas
and
give
those
tax
break
to
company
that
create
job
right
here
in
the
united
state
of
america
.
now
,
the
house
ha
passed
a
job
bill
that
includes
some
of
these
step
.
a
the
first
order
of
business
this
year
,
i
urge
the
senate
to
do
the
same
,
and
i
know
they
will
.
they
will
.
people
are
out
of
work
.
they
're
hurting
.
they
need
our
help
.
and
i
want
a
job
bill
on
my
desk
without
delay
.
but
the
truth
is
,
these
step
wo
n't
make
up
for
the
7
million
job
that
we
've
lost
over
the
last
2
year
.
the
only
way
to
move
to
full
employment
is
to
lay
a
new
foundation
for
long-term
economic
growth
and
finally
address
the
problem
that
america
's
family
have
confronted
for
year
.
we
ca
n't
afford
another
so-called
economic
``
expansion
''
like
the
one
from
the
last
decade
,
what
some
call
the
``
lost
decade
,
''
where
job
grew
more
slowly
than
during
any
prior
expansion
,
where
the
income
of
the
average
american
household
declined
while
the
cost
of
health
care
and
tuition
reached
record
high
,
where
prosperity
wa
built
on
a
housing
bubble
and
financial
speculation
.
from
the
day
i
took
office
,
i
've
been
told
that
addressing
our
larger
challenge
is
too
ambitious
;
such
an
effort
would
be
too
contentious
.
i
've
been
told
that
our
political
system
is
too
gridlocked
and
that
we
should
just
put
thing
on
hold
for
a
while
.
for
those
who
make
these
claim
,
i
have
one
simple
question
:
how
long
should
we
wait
?
how
long
should
america
put
it
future
on
hold
?
you
see
,
washington
ha
been
telling
u
to
wait
for
decade
,
even
a
the
problem
have
grown
worse
.
meanwhile
,
china
's
not
waiting
to
revamp
it
economy
.
germany
's
not
waiting
.
india
's
not
waiting
.
these
nation
are—they
're
not
standing
still
.
these
nation
are
n't
playing
for
second
place
.
they
're
putting
more
emphasis
on
math
and
science
.
they
're
rebuilding
their
infrastructure
.
they
're
making
serious
investment
in
clean
energy
because
they
want
those
job
.
well
,
i
do
not
accept
second
place
for
the
united
state
of
america
.
a
hard
a
it
may
be
,
a
uncomfortable
and
contentious
a
the
debate
may
become
,
it
's
time
to
get
serious
about
fixing
the
problem
that
are
hampering
our
growth
.
now
,
one
place
to
start
is
serious
financial
reform
.
look
,
i
am
not
interested
in
punishing
bank
.
i
'm
interested
in
protecting
our
economy
.
a
strong
,
healthy
financial
market
make
it
possible
for
business
to
access
credit
and
create
new
job
.
it
channel
the
saving
of
family
into
investment
that
raise
income
.
but
that
can
only
happen
if
we
guard
against
the
same
recklessness
that
nearly
brought
down
our
entire
economy
.
we
need
to
make
sure
consumer
and
middle
class
family
have
the
information
they
need
to
make
financial
decision
.
we
ca
n't
allow
financial
institution
,
including
those
that
take
your
deposit
,
to
take
risk
that
threaten
the
whole
economy
.
now
,
the
house
ha
already
passed
financial
reform
with
many
of
these
change
,
and
the
lobbyist
are
trying
to
kill
it
.
but
we
can
not
let
them
win
this
fight
.
and
if
the
bill
that
end
up
on
my
desk
doe
not
meet
the
test
of
real
reform
,
i
will
send
it
back
until
we
get
it
right
.
we
've
got
to
get
it
right
.
next
,
we
need
to
encourage
american
innovation
.
last
year
,
we
made
the
largest
investment
in
basic
research
funding
in
history
,
an
investment
that
could
lead
to
the
world's
cheapest
solar
cell
or
treatment
that
kill
cancer
cell
but
leaf
healthy
one
untouched
.
and
no
area
is
more
ripe
for
such
innovation
than
energy
.
you
can
see
the
result
of
last
year
's
investment
in
clean
energy
in
the
north
carolina
company
that
will
create
1,200
job
nationwide
helping
to
make
advanced
battery
or
in
the
california
business
that
will
put
a
thousand
people
to
work
making
solar
panel
.
but
to
create
more
of
these
clean
energy
job
,
we
need
more
production
,
more
efficiency
,
more
incentive
.
and
that
mean
building
a
new
generation
of
safe
,
clean
nuclear
powerplants
in
this
country
.
it
mean
making
tough
decision
about
opening
new
offshore
area
for
oil
and
gas
development
.
it
mean
continued
investment
in
advanced
biofuels
and
clean
coal
technology
.
and
,
yes
,
it
mean
passing
a
comprehensive
energy
and
climate
bill
with
incentive
that
will
finally
make
clean
energy
the
profitable
kind
of
energy
in
america
.
now
,
i
am
grateful
to
the
house
for
passing
such
a
bill
last
year
.
and
this
year
,
i
'm
eager
to
help
advance
the
bipartisan
effort
in
the
senate
.
i
know
there
have
been
question
about
whether
we
can
afford
such
change
in
a
tough
economy
.
i
know
that
there
are
those
who
disagree
with
the
overwhelming
scientific
evidence
on
climate
change
.
but
here
's
the
thing
:
even
if
you
doubt
the
evidence
,
providing
incentive
for
energy
efficiency
and
clean
energy
are
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
future
,
because
the
nation
that
lead
the
clean
energy
economy
will
be
the
nation
that
lead
the
global
economy
.
and
america
must
be
that
nation
.
third
,
we
need
to
export
more
of
our
good
,
because
the
more
product
we
make
and
sell
to
other
country
,
the
more
job
we
support
right
here
in
america
.
so
tonight
we
set
a
new
goal
:
we
will
double
our
export
over
the
next
5
year
,
an
increase
that
will
support
2
million
job
in
america
.
to
help
meet
this
goal
,
we
're
launching
a
national
export
initiative
that
will
help
farmer
and
small
business
increase
their
export
and
reform
export
control
consistent
with
national
security
.
we
have
to
seek
new
market
aggressively
,
just
a
our
competitor
are
.
if
america
sits
on
the
sideline
while
other
nation
sign
trade
deal
,
we
will
lose
the
chance
to
create
job
on
our
shore
.
but
realizing
those
benefit
also
mean
enforcing
those
agreement
so
our
trading
partner
play
by
the
rule
.
and
that
's
why
we
'll
continue
to
shape
a
doha
trade
agreement
that
open
global
market
and
why
we
will
strengthen
our
trade
relation
in
asia
and
with
key
partner
like
south
korea
and
panama
and
colombia
.
fourth
,
we
need
to
invest
in
the
skill
and
education
of
our
people
.
now
,
this
year
,
we
've
broken
through
the
stalemate
between
left
and
right
by
launching
a
national
competition
to
improve
our
school
.
and
the
idea
here
is
simple
:
instead
of
rewarding
failure
,
we
only
reward
success
.
instead
of
funding
the
status
quo
,
we
only
invest
in
reform
,
reform
that
raise
student
achievement
,
inspires
student
to
excel
in
math
and
science
,
and
turn
around
failing
school
that
steal
the
future
of
too
many
young
american
,
from
rural
community
to
the
inner
city
.
in
the
21st
century
,
the
best
antipoverty
program
around
is
a
world-class
education
.
and
in
this
country
,
the
success
of
our
child
can
not
depend
more
on
where
they
live
than
on
their
potential
.
when
we
renew
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
,
we
will
work
with
congress
to
expand
these
reform
to
all
50
state
.
still
,
in
this
economy
,
a
high
school
diploma
no
longer
guarantee
a
good
job
.
that
's
why
i
urge
the
senate
to
follow
the
house
and
pas
a
bill
that
will
revitalize
our
community
college
,
which
are
a
career
pathway
to
the
child
of
so
many
working
family
.
to
make
college
more
affordable
,
this
bill
will
finally
end
the
unwarranted
taxpayer
subsidy
that
go
to
bank
for
student
loan
.
instead
,
let
's
take
that
money
and
give
family
a
$
10,000
tax
credit
for
4
year
of
college
and
increase
pell
grant
.
and
let's
tell
another
1
million
student
that
when
they
graduate
,
they
will
be
required
to
pay
only
10
percent
of
their
income
on
student
loan
and
all
of
their
debt
will
be
forgiven
after
20
years—and
forgiven
after
10
year
if
they
choose
a
career
in
public
service
,
because
in
the
united
state
of
america
,
no
one
should
go
broke
because
they
chose
to
go
to
college
.
and
by
the
way
,
it
's
time
for
college
and
university
to
get
serious
about
cutting
their
own
cost
,
because
they
too
have
a
responsibility
to
help
solve
this
problem
.
now
,
the
price
of
college
tuition
is
just
one
of
the
burden
facing
the
middle
class
.
that
's
why
last
year
,
i
asked
vice
president
biden
to
chair
a
task
force
on
middle
class
family
.
that
's
why
we
're
nearly
doubling
the
child
care
tax
credit
and
making
it
easier
to
save
for
retirement
by
giving
access
to
every
worker
a
retirement
account
and
expanding
the
tax
credit
for
those
who
start
a
nest
egg
.
that
's
why
we
're
working
to
lift
the
value
of
a
family
's
single
largest
investment
,
their
home
.
the
step
we
took
last
year
to
shore
up
the
housing
market
have
allowed
million
of
american
to
take
out
new
loan
and
save
an
average
of
$
1,500
on
mortgage
payment
.
this
year
,
we
will
step
up
refinancing
so
that
homeowner
can
move
into
more
affordable
mortgage
.
and
it
is
precisely
to
relieve
the
burden
on
middle
class
family
that
we
still
need
health
insurance
reform
.
yes
,
we
do
.
now
,
let
's
clear
a
few
thing
up
.
i
did
n't
choose
to
tackle
this
issue
to
get
some
legislative
victory
under
my
belt
.
and
by
now
it
should
be
fairly
obvious
that
i
didn't
take
on
health
care
because
it
wa
good
politics
.
i
took
on
health
care
because
of
the
story
i
've
heard
from
american
with
preexisting
condition
whose
life
depend
on
getting
coverage
,
patient
who
've
been
denied
coverage
,
family
,
even
those
with
insurance
,
who
are
just
one
illness
away
from
financial
ruin
.
after
nearly
a
century
of
trying—democratic
administration
,
republican
administrations—we
are
closer
than
ever
to
bringing
more
security
to
the
life
of
so
many
american
.
the
approach
we
've
taken
would
protect
every
american
from
the
worst
practice
of
the
insurance
industry
.
it
would
give
small
business
and
uninsured
american
a
chance
to
choose
an
affordable
health
care
plan
in
a
competitive
market
.
it
would
require
every
insurance
plan
to
cover
preventive
care
.
and
by
the
way
,
i
want
to
acknowledge
our
first
lady
,
michelle
obama
,
who
this
year
is
creating
a
national
movement
to
tackle
the
epidemic
of
childhood
obesity
and
make
kid
healthier
.
thank
you
,
honey
.
she
get
embarrassed
.
our
approach
would
preserve
the
right
of
american
who
have
insurance
to
keep
their
doctor
and
their
plan
.
it
would
reduce
cost
and
premium
for
million
of
family
and
business
.
and
according
to
the
congressional
budget
office
,
the
independent
organization
that
both
party
have
cited
a
the
official
scorekeeper
for
congress
,
our
approach
would
bring
down
the
deficit
by
a
much
a
$
1
trillion
over
the
next
two
decade
.
still
,
this
is
a
complex
issue
,
and
the
longer
it
wa
debated
,
the
more
skeptical
people
became
.
i
take
my
share
of
the
blame
for
not
explaining
it
more
clearly
to
the
american
people
.
and
i
know
that
with
all
the
lobbying
and
horse-trading
,
the
process
left
most
american
wondering
,
``
what
's
in
it
for
me
?
''
but
i
also
know
this
problem
is
not
going
away
.
by
the
time
i
'm
finished
speaking
tonight
,
more
american
will
have
lost
their
health
insurance
.
million
will
lose
it
this
year
.
our
deficit
will
grow
.
premium
will
go
up
.
patient
will
be
denied
the
care
they
need
.
small-business
owner
will
continue
to
drop
coverage
altogether
.
i
will
not
walk
away
from
these
american
,
and
neither
should
the
people
in
this
chamber
.
so
,
a
temperature
cool
,
i
want
everyone
to
take
another
look
at
the
plan
we've
proposed
.
there
's
a
reason
why
many
doctor
,
nurse
,
and
health
care
expert
who
know
our
system
best
consider
this
approach
a
vast
improvement
over
the
status
quo
.
but
if
anyone
from
either
party
ha
a
better
approach
that
will
bring
down
premium
,
bring
down
the
deficit
,
cover
the
uninsured
,
strengthen
medicare
for
senior
,
and
stop
insurance
company
abuse
,
let
me
know
.
let
me
know
.
let
me
know
.
i
'm
eager
to
see
it
.
here
's
what
i
ask
congress
,
though
:
do
n't
walk
away
from
reform
.
not
now
.
not
when
we
are
so
close
.
let
u
find
a
way
to
come
together
and
finish
the
job
for
the
american
people
.
let
's
get
it
done
.
let
's
get
it
done
.
now
,
even
a
health
care
reform
would
reduce
our
deficit
,
it
's
not
enough
to
dig
u
out
of
a
massive
fiscal
hole
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
it
's
a
challenge
that
make
all
others
that
much
harder
to
solve
and
one
that
's
been
subject
to
a
lot
of
political
posturing
.
so
let
me
start
the
discussion
of
government
spending
by
setting
the
record
straight
.
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
decade
,
the
year
2000
,
america
had
a
budget
surplus
of
over
$
200
billion
.
by
the
time
i
took
office
,
we
had
a
1-year
deficit
of
over
$
1
trillion
and
projected
deficit
of
$
8
trillion
over
the
next
decade
.
most
of
this
wa
the
result
of
not
paying
for
two
war
,
two
tax
cut
,
and
an
expensive
prescription
drug
program
.
on
top
of
that
,
the
effect
of
the
recession
put
a
$
3
trillion
hole
in
our
budget
.
all
this
wa
before
i
walked
in
the
door
.
now—just
stating
the
fact
.
now
,
if
we
had
taken
office
in
ordinary
time
,
i
would
have
liked
nothing
more
than
to
start
bringing
down
the
deficit
.
but
we
took
office
amid
a
crisis
.
and
our
effort
to
prevent
a
second
depression
have
added
another
$
1
trillion
to
our
national
debt
.
that
too
is
a
fact
.
i
'm
absolutely
convinced
that
wa
the
right
thing
to
do
.
but
family
across
the
country
are
tightening
their
belt
and
making
tough
decision
.
the
federal
government
should
do
the
same
.
so
tonight
i
'm
proposing
specific
step
to
pay
for
the
trillion
dollar
that
it
took
to
rescue
the
economy
last
year
.
starting
in
2011
,
we
are
prepared
to
freeze
government
spending
for
3
year
.
spending
related
to
our
national
security
,
medicare
,
medicaid
,
and
social
security
will
not
be
affected
.
but
all
other
discretionary
government
program
will
.
like
any
cash-strapped
family
,
we
will
work
within
a
budget
to
invest
in
what
we
need
and
sacrifice
what
we
do
n't
.
and
if
i
have
to
enforce
this
discipline
by
veto
,
i
will
.
we
will
continue
to
go
through
the
budget
,
line
by
line
,
page
by
page
,
to
eliminate
program
that
we
ca
n't
afford
and
do
n't
work
.
we
've
already
identified
$
20
billion
in
saving
for
next
year
.
to
help
working
family
,
we
'll
extend
our
middle
class
tax
cut
.
but
at
a
time
of
record
deficit
,
we
will
not
continue
tax
cut
for
oil
company
,
for
investment
fund
manager
,
and
for
those
making
over
$
250,000
a
year
.
we
just
can't
afford
it
.
now
,
even
after
paying
for
what
we
spent
on
my
watch
,
we
'll
still
face
the
massive
deficit
we
had
when
i
took
office
.
more
importantly
,
the
cost
of
medicare
,
medicaid
,
and
social
security
will
continue
to
skyrocket
.
that
's
why
i
've
called
for
a
bipartisan
fiscal
commission
,
modeled
on
a
proposal
by
republican
judd
gregg
and
democrat
kent
conrad
.
this
ca
n't
be
one
of
those
washington
gimmick
that
let
u
pretend
we
solve
a
problem
.
the
commission
will
have
to
provide
a
specific
set
of
solution
by
a
certain
deadline
.
now
,
yesterday
the
senate
blocked
a
bill
that
would
have
created
this
commission
,
so
i'll
issue
an
executive
order
that
will
allow
u
to
go
forward
,
because
i
refuse
to
pas
this
problem
on
to
another
generation
of
american
.
and
when
the
vote
come
tomorrow
,
the
senate
should
restore
the
pay-as-you-go
law
that
wa
a
big
reason
for
why
we
had
record
surplus
in
the
1990s
.
now
,
i
know
that
some
in
my
own
party
will
argue
that
we
ca
n't
address
the
deficit
or
freeze
government
spending
when
so
many
are
still
hurting
.
and
i
agree
,
which
is
why
this
freeze
wo
n't
take
effect
until
next
year
,
when
the
economy
is
stronger
.
that
's
how
budgeting
work
.
but
understand
,
if
we
do
n't
take
meaningful
step
to
rein
in
our
debt
,
it
could
damage
our
market
,
increase
the
cost
of
borrowing
,
and
jeopardize
our
recovery
,
all
of
which
would
have
an
even
worse
effect
on
our
job
growth
and
family
income
.
from
some
on
the
right
,
i
expect
we
'll
hear
a
different
argument
,
that
if
we
just
make
fewer
investment
in
our
people
,
extend
tax
cut
,
including
those
for
the
wealthier
american
,
eliminate
more
regulation
,
maintain
the
status
quo
on
health
care
,
our
deficit
will
go
away
.
the
problem
is
,
that
's
what
we
did
for
8
year
.
that
's
what
helped
u
into
this
crisis
.
it
's
what
helped
lead
to
these
deficit
.
we
ca
n't
do
it
again
.
rather
than
fight
the
same
tired
battle
that
have
dominated
washington
for
decade
,
it's
time
to
try
something
new
.
let
's
invest
in
our
people
without
leaving
them
a
mountain
of
debt
.
let
's
meet
our
responsibility
to
the
citizen
who
sent
u
here
.
let
's
try
common
sense—a
novel
concept
.
now
,
to
do
that
,
we
have
to
recognize
that
we
face
more
than
a
deficit
of
dollar
right
now
.
we
face
a
deficit
of
trust
,
deep
and
corrosive
doubt
about
how
washington
work
that
have
been
growing
for
year
.
to
close
that
credibility
gap
,
we
have
to
take
action
on
both
end
of
pennsylvania
avenue
to
end
the
outsized
influence
of
lobbyist
,
to
do
our
work
openly
,
to
give
our
people
the
government
they
deserve
.
now
,
that
's
what
i
came
to
washington
to
do
.
that
's
why
,
for
the
first
time
in
history
,
my
administration
post
on—our
white
house
visitor
online
.
that
's
why
we
've
excluded
lobbyist
from
policymaking
job
or
seat
on
federal
board
and
commission
.
but
we
ca
n't
stop
there
.
it
's
time
to
require
lobbyist
to
disclose
each
contact
they
make
on
behalf
of
a
client
,
with
my
administration
or
with
congress
.
it
's
time
to
put
strict
limit
on
the
contribution
that
lobbyist
give
to
candidate
for
federal
office
.
with
all
due
deference
to
separation
of
power
,
last
week
,
the
supreme
court
reversed
a
century
of
law
that
i
believe
will
open
the
floodgate
for
special
interest
,
including
foreign
corporation
,
to
spend
without
limit
in
our
election
.
i
do
n't
think
american
election
should
be
bankrolled
by
america
's
most
powerful
interest
,
or
worse
,
by
foreign
entity
.
they
should
be
decided
by
the
american
people
.
and
i
'd
urge
democrat
and
republican
to
pas
a
bill
that
help
correct
some
of
these
problem
.
i
'm
also
calling
on
congress
to
continue
down
the
path
of
earmark
reform
,
democrat
and
republicans—democrats
and
republican
.
look
,
you
've
trimmed
some
of
this
spending
,
you
've
embraced
some
meaningful
change
,
but
restoring
the
public
trust
demand
more
.
for
example
,
some
member
of
congress
post
some
earmark
request
online
.
tonight
i
'm
calling
on
congress
to
publish
all
earmark
request
on
a
single
web
site
before
there
's
a
vote
so
that
the
american
people
can
see
how
their
money
is
being
spent
.
of
course
,
none
of
these
reform
will
even
happen
if
we
do
n't
also
reform
how
we
work
with
one
another
.
now
,
i
'm
not
naive
.
i
never
thought
that
the
mere
fact
of
my
election
would
usher
in
peace
and
harmony
and—some
postpartisan
era
.
i
knew
that
both
party
have
fed
division
that
are
deeply
entrenched
.
and
on
some
issue
,
there
are
simply
philosophical
difference
that
will
always
cause
u
to
part
way
.
these
disagreement
,
about
the
role
of
government
in
our
life
,
about
our
national
priority
and
our
national
security
,
they
've
been
taking
place
for
over
200
year
.
they
're
the
very
essence
of
our
democracy
.
but
what
frustrates
the
american
people
is
a
washington
where
every
day
is
election
day
.
we
ca
n't
wage
a
perpetual
campaign
where
the
only
goal
is
to
see
who
can
get
the
most
embarrassing
headline
about
the
other
side
,
a
belief
that
if
you
lose
,
i
win
.
neither
party
should
delay
or
obstruct
every
single
bill
just
because
they
can
.
the
confirmation
of—i
'm
speaking
to
both
party
now
.
the
confirmation
of
well-qualified
public
servant
should
n't
be
held
hostage
to
the
pet
project
or
grudge
of
a
few
individual
senator
.
washington
may
think
that
saying
anything
about
the
other
side
,
no
matter
how
false
,
no
matter
how
malicious
,
is
just
part
of
the
game
.
but
it
's
precisely
such
politics
that
ha
stopped
either
party
from
helping
the
american
people
.
worse
yet
,
it
's
sowing
further
division
among
our
citizen
,
further
distrust
in
our
government
.
so
,
no
,
i
will
not
give
up
on
trying
to
change
the
tone
of
our
politics
.
i
know
it
's
an
election
year
.
and
after
last
week
,
it
's
clear
that
campaign
fever
ha
come
even
earlier
than
usual
.
but
we
still
need
to
govern
.
to
democrat
,
i
would
remind
you
that
we
still
have
the
largest
majority
in
decade
and
the
people
expect
u
to
solve
problem
,
not
run
for
the
hill
.
and
if
the
republican
leadership
is
going
to
insist
that
60
vote
in
the
senate
are
required
to
do
any
business
at
all
in
this
town—a
supermajority—then
the
responsibility
to
govern
is
now
yours
a
well
.
just
saying
no
to
everything
may
be
good
short-term
politics
,
but
it's
not
leadership
.
we
were
sent
here
to
serve
our
citizen
,
not
our
ambition
.
so
let's
show
the
american
people
that
we
can
do
it
together
.
this
week
,
i
'll
be
addressing
a
meeting
of
the
house
republican
.
i
'd
like
to
begin
monthly
meeting
with
both
democratic
and
republican
leadership
.
i
know
you
ca
n't
wait
.
now
,
throughout
our
history
,
no
issue
ha
united
this
country
more
than
our
security
.
sadly
,
some
of
the
unity
we
felt
after
9/11
ha
dissipated
.
and
we
can
argue
all
we
want
about
who
's
to
blame
for
this
,
but
i
'm
not
interested
in
relitigating
the
past
.
i
know
that
all
of
u
love
this
country
.
all
of
u
are
committed
to
it
defense
.
so
let
's
put
aside
the
schoolyard
taunt
about
who
's
tough
.
let
's
reject
the
false
choice
between
protecting
our
people
and
upholding
our
value
.
let
's
leave
behind
the
fear
and
division
and
do
what
it
take
to
defend
our
nation
and
forge
a
more
hopeful
future
for
america
and
for
the
world
.
that
's
the
work
we
began
last
year
.
since
the
day
i
took
office
,
we
've
renewed
our
focus
on
the
terrorist
who
threaten
our
nation
.
we
've
made
substantial
investment
in
our
homeland
security
and
disrupted
plot
that
threatened
to
take
american
life
.
we
are
filling
unacceptable
gap
revealed
by
the
failed
christmas
attack
,
with
better
airline
security
and
swifter
action
on
our
intelligence
.
we
've
prohibited
torture
and
strengthened
partnership
from
the
pacific
to
south
asia
to
the
arabian
peninsula
.
and
in
the
last
year
,
hundred
of
al
qaida
's
fighter
and
affiliate
,
including
many
senior
leader
,
have
been
captured
or
killed
,
far
more
than
in
2008
.
and
in
afghanistan
,
we
're
increasing
our
troop
and
training
afghan
security
force
so
they
can
begin
to
take
the
lead
in
july
of
2011
and
our
troop
can
begin
to
come
home
.
we
will
reward
good
governance
,
work
to
reduce
corruption
,
and
support
the
right
of
all
afghan
,
men
and
woman
alike
.
we
're
joined
by
ally
and
partner
who
have
increased
their
own
commitment
and
who
will
come
together
tomorrow
in
london
to
reaffirm
our
common
purpose
.
there
will
be
difficult
day
ahead
,
but
i
am
absolutely
confident
we
will
succeed
.
a
we
take
the
fight
to
al
qaida
,
we
are
responsibly
leaving
iraq
to
it
people
.
a
a
candidate
,
i
promised
that
i
would
end
this
war
,
and
that
is
what
i
am
doing
a
president
.
we
will
have
all
of
our
combat
troop
out
of
iraq
by
the
end
of
this
august
.
we
will
support
the
iraqi
government
a
they
hold
election
,
and
we
will
continue
to
partner
with
the
iraqi
people
to
promote
regional
peace
and
prosperity
.
but
make
no
mistake
:
this
war
is
ending
,
and
all
of
our
troop
are
coming
home
.
tonight
all
of
our
men
and
woman
in
uniform
,
in
iraq
,
in
afghanistan
,
and
around
the
world
,
they
have
to
know
that
we—that
they
have
our
respect
,
our
gratitude
,
our
full
support
.
and
just
a
they
must
have
the
resource
they
need
in
war
,
we
all
have
a
responsibility
to
support
them
when
they
come
home
.
that
's
why
we
made
the
largest
increase
in
investment
for
veteran
in
decade
last
year
.
that
's
why
we
're
building
a
21st
century
va.
and
that
's
why
michelle
ha
joined
with
jill
biden
to
forge
a
national
commitment
to
support
military
family
.
now
,
even
a
we
prosecute
two
war
,
we
're
also
confronting
perhaps
the
greatest
danger
to
the
american
people
,
the
threat
of
nuclear
weapon
.
i
've
embraced
the
vision
of
john
f.
kennedy
and
ronald
reagan
through
a
strategy
that
revers
the
spread
of
these
weapon
and
seek
a
world
without
them
.
to
reduce
our
stockpile
and
launcher
,
while
ensuring
our
deterrent
,
the
united
state
and
russia
are
completing
negotiation
on
the
farthest
reaching
arm
control
treaty
in
nearly
two
decade
.
and
at
april
's
nuclear
security
summit
,
we
will
bring
44
nation
together
here
in
washington
,
dc
,
behind
a
clear
goal
:
securing
all
vulnerable
nuclear
material
around
the
world
in
4
year
so
that
they
never
fall
into
the
hand
of
terrorist
.
now
,
these
diplomatic
effort
have
also
strengthened
our
hand
in
dealing
with
those
nation
that
insist
on
violating
international
agreement
in
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapon
.
that
's
why
north
korea
now
face
increased
isolation
and
stronger
sanction
,
sanction
that
are
being
vigorously
enforced
.
that
's
why
the
international
community
is
more
united
and
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
is
more
isolated
.
and
a
iran
's
leader
continue
to
ignore
their
obligation
,
there
should
be
no
doubt
:
they
too
will
face
growing
consequence
.
that
is
a
promise
.
that
's
the
leadership
we
are
providing
:
engagement
that
advance
the
common
security
and
prosperity
of
all
people
.
we
're
working
through
the
g-20
to
sustain
a
lasting
global
recovery
.
we
're
working
with
muslim
community
around
the
world
to
promote
science
and
education
and
innovation
.
we
have
gone
from
a
bystander
to
a
leader
in
the
fight
against
climate
change
.
we
're
helping
developing
country
to
feed
themselves
and
continuing
the
fight
against
hiv/aids
.
and
we
are
launching
a
new
initiative
that
will
give
u
the
capacity
to
respond
faster
and
more
effectively
to
bioterrorism
or
an
infectious
disease
,
a
plan
that
will
counter
threat
at
home
and
strengthen
public
health
abroad
.
a
we
have
for
over
60
year
,
america
take
these
action
because
our
destiny
is
connected
to
those
beyond
our
shore
.
but
we
also
do
it
because
it
is
right
.
that
's
why
,
a
we
meet
here
tonight
,
over
10,000
american
are
working
with
many
nation
to
help
the
people
of
haiti
recover
and
rebuild
.
that
's
why
we
stand
with
the
girl
who
yearns
to
go
to
school
in
afghanistan
,
why
we
support
the
human
right
of
the
woman
marching
through
the
street
of
iran
,
why
we
advocate
for
the
young
man
denied
a
job
by
corruption
in
guinea
.
for
america
must
always
stand
on
the
side
of
freedom
and
human
dignity—always
.
abroad
,
america
's
greatest
source
of
strength
ha
always
been
our
ideal
.
the
same
is
true
at
home
.
we
find
unity
in
our
incredible
diversity
,
drawing
on
the
promise
enshrined
in
our
constitution
:
the
notion
that
we
're
all
created
equal
;
that
no
matter
who
you
are
or
what
you
look
like
,
if
you
abide
by
the
law
,
you
should
be
protected
by
it
;
if
you
adhere
to
our
common
value
,
you
should
be
treated
no
different
than
anyone
else
.
we
must
continually
renew
this
promise
.
my
administration
ha
a
civil
right
division
that
is
once
again
prosecuting
civil
right
violation
and
employment
discrimination
.
we
finally
strengthened
our
law
to
protect
against
crime
driven
by
hate
.
this
year
,
i
will
work
with
congress
and
our
military
to
finally
repeal
the
law
that
denies
gay
american
the
right
to
serve
the
country
they
love
because
of
who
they
are
.
it
's
the
right
thing
to
do
.
we
're
going
to
crackdown
on
violation
of
equal
pay
law
so
that
woman
get
equal
pay
for
an
equal
day
's
work
.
and
we
should
continue
the
work
of
fixing
our
broken
immigration
system
,
to
secure
our
border
and
enforce
our
law
and
ensure
that
everyone
who
play
by
the
rule
can
contribute
to
our
economy
and
enrich
our
nation
.
in
the
end
,
it
's
our
ideal
,
our
value
that
built
america
,
value
that
allowed
u
to
forge
a
nation
made
up
of
immigrant
from
every
corner
of
the
globe
,
value
that
drive
our
citizen
still
.
every
day
,
american
meet
their
responsibility
to
their
family
and
their
employer
.
time
and
again
,
they
lend
a
hand
to
their
neighbor
and
give
back
to
their
country
.
they
take
pride
in
their
labor
and
are
generous
in
spirit
.
these
are
n't
republican
value
or
democratic
value
that
they
're
living
by
,
business
value
or
labor
value
,
they
're
american
value
.
unfortunately
,
too
many
of
our
citizen
have
lost
faith
that
our
biggest
institutions—our
corporation
,
our
medium
,
and
,
yes
,
our
government—still
reflect
these
same
value
.
each
of
these
institution
are
full
of
honorable
men
and
woman
doing
important
work
that
help
our
country
prosper
.
but
each
time
a
ceo
reward
himself
for
failure
or
a
banker
put
the
rest
of
u
at
risk
for
his
own
selfish
gain
,
people
's
doubt
grow
.
each
time
lobbyist
game
the
system
or
politician
tear
each
other
down
instead
of
lifting
this
country
up
,
we
lose
faith
.
the
more
that
tv
pundit
reduce
serious
debate
to
silly
argument
,
big
issue
into
sound
bite
,
our
citizen
turn
away
.
no
wonder
there
's
so
much
cynicism
out
there
.
no
wonder
there
's
so
much
disappointment
.
i
campaigned
on
the
promise
of
change
.
change
we
can
believe
in
,
the
slogan
went
.
and
right
now
i
know
there
are
many
american
who
are
n't
sure
if
they
still
believe
we
can
change
or
that
i
can
deliver
it
.
but
remember
this
:
i
never
suggested
that
change
would
be
easy
or
that
i
could
do
it
alone
.
democracy
in
a
nation
of
300
million
people
can
be
noisy
and
messy
and
complicated
.
and
when
you
try
to
do
big
thing
and
make
big
change
,
it
stir
passion
and
controversy
.
that
's
just
how
it
is
.
those
of
u
in
public
office
can
respond
to
this
reality
by
playing
it
safe
and
avoid
telling
hard
truth
and
pointing
finger
.
we
can
do
what
's
necessary
to
keep
our
poll
number
high
and
get
through
the
next
election
,
instead
of
doing
what
's
best
for
the
next
generation
.
but
i
also
know
this
:
if
people
had
made
that
decision
50
year
ago
or
100
year
ago
or
200
year
ago
,
we
would
n't
be
here
tonight
.
the
only
reason
we
are
here
is
because
generation
of
american
were
unafraid
to
do
what
wa
hard
,
to
do
what
wa
needed
even
when
success
wa
uncertain
,
to
do
what
it
took
to
keep
the
dream
of
this
nation
alive
for
their
child
and
their
grandchild
.
now
,
our
administration
ha
had
some
political
setback
this
year
,
and
some
of
them
were
deserved
.
but
i
wake
up
every
day
knowing
that
they
are
nothing
compared
to
the
setback
that
family
all
across
this
country
have
faced
this
year
.
and
what
keep
me
going
,
what
keep
me
fighting
,
is
that
despite
all
these
setback
