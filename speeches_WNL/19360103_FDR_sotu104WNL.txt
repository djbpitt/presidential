mr.
president
,
mr.
speaker
,
member
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representative
:
we
are
about
to
enter
upon
another
year
of
the
responsibility
which
the
electorate
of
the
united
state
ha
placed
in
our
hand
.
having
come
so
far
,
it
is
fitting
that
we
should
pause
to
survey
the
ground
which
we
have
covered
and
the
path
which
lie
ahead
.
on
the
fourth
day
of
march
,
1933
,
on
the
occasion
of
taking
the
oath
of
office
a
president
of
the
united
state
,
i
addressed
the
people
of
our
country
.
need
i
recall
either
the
scene
or
the
national
circumstance
attending
the
occasion
?
the
crisis
of
that
moment
wa
almost
exclusively
a
national
one
.
in
recognition
of
that
fact
,
so
obvious
to
the
million
in
the
street
and
in
the
home
of
america
,
i
devoted
by
far
the
greater
part
of
that
address
to
what
i
called
,
and
the
nation
called
,
critical
day
within
our
own
border
.
you
will
remember
that
on
that
fourth
of
march
,
1933
,
the
world
picture
wa
an
image
of
substantial
peace
.
international
consultation
and
widespread
hope
for
the
bettering
of
relation
between
the
nation
gave
to
all
of
u
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
barrier
to
mutual
confidence
,
to
increased
trade
,
and
to
the
peaceful
settlement
of
dispute
could
be
progressively
removed
.
in
fact
,
my
only
reference
to
the
field
of
world
policy
in
that
address
wa
in
these
word
:
``
i
would
dedicate
this
nation
to
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor—the
neighbor
who
resolutely
respect
himself
and
,
because
he
doe
so
,
respect
the
right
of
others—a
neighbor
who
respect
his
obligation
and
respect
the
sanctity
of
his
agreement
in
and
with
a
world
of
neighbor
.
''
in
the
year
that
have
followed
,
that
sentiment
ha
remained
the
dedication
of
this
nation
.
among
the
nation
of
the
great
western
hemisphere
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor
ha
happily
prevailed
.
at
no
time
in
the
four
and
a
half
century
of
modern
civilization
in
the
america
ha
there
existed—in
any
year
,
in
any
decade
,
in
any
generation
in
all
that
time—a
greater
spirit
of
mutual
understanding
,
of
common
helpfulness
,
and
of
devotion
to
the
ideal
of
self-government
than
exists
today
in
the
twenty-one
american
republic
and
their
neighbor
,
the
dominion
of
canada
.
this
policy
of
the
good
neighbor
among
the
america
is
no
longer
a
hope
,
no
longer
an
objective
remaining
to
be
accomplished
.
it
is
a
fact
,
active
,
present
,
pertinent
and
effective
.
in
this
achievement
,
every
american
nation
take
an
understanding
part
.
there
is
neither
war
,
nor
rumor
of
war
,
nor
desire
for
war
.
the
inhabitant
of
this
vast
area
,
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
strong
,
spreading
more
than
eight
thousand
mile
from
the
arctic
to
the
antarctic
,
believe
in
,
and
propose
to
follow
,
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor
.
they
wish
with
all
their
heart
that
the
rest
of
the
world
might
do
likewise
.
the
rest
of
the
world—ah
!
there
is
the
rub
.
were
i
today
to
deliver
an
inaugural
address
to
the
people
of
the
united
state
,
i
could
not
limit
my
comment
on
world
affair
to
one
paragraph
.
with
much
regret
i
should
be
compelled
to
devote
the
greater
part
to
world
affair
.
since
the
summer
of
that
same
year
of
1933
,
the
temper
and
the
purpose
of
the
ruler
of
many
of
the
great
population
in
europe
and
in
asia
have
not
pointed
the
way
either
to
peace
or
to
good-will
among
men
.
not
only
have
peace
and
good-will
among
men
grown
more
remote
in
those
area
of
the
earth
during
this
period
,
but
a
point
ha
been
reached
where
the
people
of
the
america
must
take
cognizance
of
growing
ill-will
,
of
marked
trend
toward
aggression
,
of
increasing
armament
,
of
shortening
tempers—a
situation
which
ha
in
it
many
of
the
element
that
lead
to
the
tragedy
of
general
war
.
on
those
other
continent
many
nation
,
principally
the
smaller
people
,
if
left
to
themselves
,
would
be
content
with
their
boundary
and
willing
to
solve
within
themselves
and
in
cooperation
with
their
neighbor
their
individual
problem
,
both
economic
and
social
.
the
ruler
of
those
nation
,
deep
in
their
heart
,
follow
these
peaceful
and
reasonable
aspiration
of
their
people
.
these
ruler
must
remain
ever
vigilant
against
the
possibility
today
or
tomorrow
of
invasion
or
attack
by
the
ruler
of
other
people
who
fail
to
subscribe
to
the
principle
of
bettering
the
human
race
by
peaceful
mean
.
within
those
other
nations—those
which
today
must
bear
the
primary
,
definite
responsibility
for
jeopardizing
world
peace
-what
hope
lie
?
to
say
the
least
,
there
are
ground
for
pessimism
.
it
is
idle
for
u
or
for
others
to
preach
that
the
mass
of
the
people
who
constitute
those
nation
which
are
dominated
by
the
twin
spirit
of
autocracy
and
aggression
,
are
out
of
sympathy
with
their
ruler
,
that
they
are
allowed
no
opportunity
to
express
themselves
,
that
they
would
change
thing
if
they
could
.
that
,
unfortunately
,
is
not
so
clear
.
it
might
be
true
that
the
mass
of
the
people
in
those
nation
would
change
the
policy
of
their
government
if
they
could
be
allowed
full
freedom
and
full
access
to
the
process
of
democratic
government
a
we
understand
them
.
but
they
do
not
have
that
access
;
lacking
it
they
follow
blindly
and
fervently
the
lead
of
those
who
seek
autocratic
power
.
nation
seeking
expansion
,
seeking
the
rectification
of
injustice
springing
from
former
war
,
or
seeking
outlet
for
trade
,
for
population
or
even
for
their
own
peaceful
contribution
to
the
progress
of
civilization
,
fail
to
demonstrate
that
patience
necessary
to
attain
reasonable
and
legitimate
objective
by
peaceful
negotiation
or
by
an
appeal
to
the
finer
instinct
of
world
justice
.
they
have
therefore
impatiently
reverted
to
the
old
belief
in
the
law
of
the
sword
,
or
to
the
fantastic
conception
that
they
,
and
they
alone
,
are
chosen
to
fulfill
a
mission
and
that
all
the
others
among
the
billion
and
a
half
of
human
being
in
the
world
must
and
shall
learn
from
and
be
subject
to
them
.
i
recognize
and
you
will
recognize
that
these
word
which
i
have
chosen
with
deliberation
will
not
prove
popular
in
any
nation
that
chooses
to
fit
this
shoe
to
it
foot
.
such
sentiment
,
however
,
will
find
sympathy
and
understanding
in
those
nation
where
the
people
themselves
are
honestly
desirous
of
peace
but
must
constantly
align
themselves
on
one
side
or
the
other
in
the
kaleidoscopic
jockeying
for
position
which
is
characteristic
of
european
and
asiatic
relation
today
.
for
the
peace-loving
nation
,
and
there
are
many
of
them
,
find
that
their
very
identity
depends
on
their
moving
and
moving
again
on
the
chess
board
of
international
politics
.
i
suggested
in
the
spring
of
1933
that
85
or
90
percent
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
were
content
with
the
territorial
limit
of
their
respective
nation
and
were
willing
further
to
reduce
their
armed
force
if
every
other
nation
in
the
world
would
agree
to
do
likewise
.
that
is
equally
true
today
,
and
it
is
even
more
true
today
that
world
peace
and
world
good-will
are
blocked
by
only
10
or
15
percent
of
the
world
's
population
.
that
is
why
effort
to
reduce
army
have
thus
far
not
only
failed
,
but
have
been
met
by
vastly
increased
armament
on
land
and
in
the
air
.
that
is
why
even
effort
to
continue
the
existing
limit
on
naval
armament
into
the
year
to
come
show
such
little
current
success
.
but
the
policy
of
the
united
state
ha
been
clear
and
consistent
.
we
have
sought
with
earnestness
in
every
possible
way
to
limit
world
armament
and
to
attain
the
peaceful
solution
of
dispute
among
all
nation
.
we
have
sought
by
every
legitimate
mean
to
exert
our
moral
influence
against
repression
,
against
intolerance
,
against
autocracy
and
in
favor
of
freedom
of
expression
,
equality
before
the
law
,
religious
tolerance
and
popular
rule
.
in
the
field
of
commerce
we
have
undertaken
to
encourage
a
more
reasonable
interchange
of
the
world
's
good
.
in
the
field
of
international
finance
we
have
,
so
far
a
we
are
concerned
,
put
an
end
to
dollar
diplomacy
,
to
money
grabbing
,
to
speculation
for
the
benefit
of
the
powerful
and
the
rich
,
at
the
expense
of
the
small
and
the
poor
.
a
a
consistent
part
of
a
clear
policy
,
the
united
state
is
following
a
twofold
neutrality
toward
any
and
all
nation
which
engage
in
war
that
are
not
of
immediate
concern
to
the
america
.
first
,
we
decline
to
encourage
the
prosecution
of
war
by
permitting
belligerent
to
obtain
arm
,
ammunition
or
implement
of
war
from
the
united
state
.
second
,
we
seek
to
discourage
the
use
by
belligerent
nation
of
any
and
all
american
product
calculated
to
facilitate
the
prosecution
of
a
war
in
quantity
over
and
above
our
normal
export
of
them
in
time
of
peace
.
i
trust
that
these
objective
thus
clearly
and
unequivocally
stated
will
be
carried
forward
by
cooperation
between
this
congress
and
the
president
.
i
realize
that
i
have
emphasized
to
you
the
gravity
of
the
situation
which
confronts
the
people
of
the
world
.
this
emphasis
is
justified
because
of
it
importance
to
civilization
and
therefore
to
the
united
state
.
peace
is
jeopardized
by
the
few
and
not
by
the
many
.
peace
is
threatened
by
those
who
seek
selfish
power
.
the
world
ha
witnessed
similar
eras—
a
in
the
day
when
petty
king
and
feudal
baron
were
changing
the
map
of
europe
every
fortnight
,
or
when
great
emperor
and
great
king
were
engaged
in
a
mad
scramble
for
colonial
empire
.
we
hope
that
we
are
not
again
at
the
threshold
of
such
an
era
.
but
if
face
it
we
must
,
then
the
united
state
and
the
rest
of
the
america
can
play
but
one
role
:
through
a
well-ordered
neutrality
to
do
naught
to
encourage
the
contest
,
through
adequate
defense
to
save
ourselves
from
embroilment
and
attack
,
and
through
example
and
all
legitimate
encouragement
and
assistance
to
persuade
other
nation
to
return
to
the
way
of
peace
and
good-will
.
the
evidence
before
u
clearly
prof
that
autocracy
in
world
affair
endangers
peace
and
that
such
threat
do
not
spring
from
those
nation
devoted
to
the
democratic
ideal
.
if
this
be
true
in
world
affair
,
it
should
have
the
greatest
weight
in
the
determination
of
domestic
policy
.
within
democratic
nation
the
chief
concern
of
the
people
is
to
prevent
the
continuance
or
the
rise
of
autocratic
institution
that
beget
slavery
at
home
and
aggression
abroad
.
within
our
border
,
a
in
the
world
at
large
,
popular
opinion
is
at
war
with
a
power-seeking
minority
.
that
is
no
new
thing
.
it
wa
fought
out
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
1787
.
from
time
to
time
since
then
,
the
battle
ha
been
continued
,
under
thomas
jefferson
,
andrew
jackson
,
theodore
roosevelt
and
woodrow
wilson
.
in
these
latter
year
we
have
witnessed
the
domination
of
government
by
financial
and
industrial
group
,
numerically
small
but
politically
dominant
in
the
twelve
year
that
succeeded
the
world
war
.
the
present
group
of
which
i
speak
is
indeed
numerically
small
and
,
while
it
exercise
a
large
influence
and
ha
much
to
say
in
the
world
of
business
,
it
doe
not
,
i
am
confident
,
speak
the
true
sentiment
of
the
le
articulate
but
more
important
element
that
constitute
real
american
business
.
in
march
,
1933
,
i
appealed
to
the
congress
of
the
united
state
and
to
the
people
of
the
united
state
in
a
new
effort
to
restore
power
to
those
to
whom
it
rightfully
belonged
.
the
response
to
that
appeal
resulted
in
the
writing
of
a
new
chapter
in
the
history
of
popular
government
.
you
,
the
member
of
the
legislative
branch
,
and
i
,
the
executive
,
contended
for
and
established
a
new
relationship
between
government
and
people
.
what
were
the
term
of
that
new
relationship
?
they
were
an
appeal
from
the
clamor
of
many
private
and
selfish
interest
,
yes
,
an
appeal
from
the
clamor
of
partisan
interest
,
to
the
ideal
of
the
public
interest
.
government
became
the
representative
and
the
trustee
of
the
public
interest
.
our
aim
wa
to
build
upon
essentially
democratic
institution
,
seeking
all
the
while
the
adjustment
of
burden
,
the
help
of
the
needy
,
the
protection
of
the
weak
,
the
liberation
of
the
exploited
and
the
genuine
protection
of
the
people's
property
.
it
go
without
saying
that
to
create
such
an
economic
constitutional
order
,
more
than
a
single
legislative
enactment
wa
called
for
.
we
,
you
in
the
congress
and
i
a
the
executive
,
had
to
build
upon
a
broad
base
.
now
,
after
thirty-four
month
of
work
,
we
contemplate
a
fairly
rounded
whole
.
we
have
returned
the
control
of
the
federal
government
to
the
city
of
washington
.
to
be
sure
,
in
so
doing
,
we
have
invited
battle
.
we
have
earned
the
hatred
of
entrenched
greed
.
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
that
we
faced
made
it
necessary
to
drive
some
people
from
power
and
strictly
to
regulate
others
.
i
made
that
plain
when
i
took
the
oath
of
office
in
march
,
1933
.
i
spoke
of
the
practice
of
the
unscrupulous
money-changers
who
stood
indicted
in
the
court
of
public
opinion
.
i
spoke
of
the
ruler
of
the
exchange
of
mankind
's
good
,
who
failed
through
their
own
stubbornness
and
their
own
incompetence
.
i
said
that
they
had
admitted
their
failure
and
had
abdicated
.
abdicated
?
yes
,
in
1933
,
but
now
with
the
passing
of
danger
they
forget
their
damaging
admission
and
withdraw
their
abdication
.
they
seek
the
restoration
of
their
selfish
power
.
they
offer
to
lead
u
back
round
the
same
old
corner
into
the
same
old
dreary
street
.
yes
,
there
are
still
determined
group
that
are
intent
upon
that
very
thing
.
rigorously
held
up
to
popular
examination
,
their
true
character
present
itself
.
they
steal
the
livery
of
great
national
constitutional
ideal
to
serve
discredited
special
interest
.
a
guardian
and
trustee
for
great
group
of
individual
stockholder
they
wrongfully
seek
to
carry
the
property
and
the
interest
entrusted
to
them
into
the
arena
of
partisan
politics
.
they
seek-this
minority
in
business
and
industry—to
control
and
often
do
control
and
use
for
their
own
purpose
legitimate
and
highly
honored
business
association
;
they
engage
in
vast
propaganda
to
spread
fear
and
discord
among
the
people—they
would
``
gang
up
''
against
the
people
's
liberty
.
the
principle
that
they
would
instill
into
government
if
they
succeed
in
seizing
power
is
well
shown
by
the
principle
which
many
of
them
have
instilled
into
their
own
affair
:
autocracy
toward
labor
,
toward
stockholder
,
toward
consumer
,
toward
public
sentiment
.
autocrat
in
smaller
thing
,
they
seek
autocracy
in
bigger
thing
.
``
by
their
fruit
ye
shall
know
them
.
''
if
these
gentleman
believe
,
a
they
say
they
believe
,
that
the
measure
adopted
by
this
congress
and
it
predecessor
,
and
carried
out
by
this
administration
,
have
hindered
rather
than
promoted

member
of
the
congress
,
let
these
challenge
be
met
.
if
this
is
what
these
gentleman
want
,
let
them
say
so
to
the
congress
of
the
united
state
.
let
them
no
longer
hide
their
dissent
in
a
cowardly
cloak
of
generality
.
let
them
define
the
issue
.
we
have
been
specific
in
our
affirmative
action
.
let
them
be
specific
in
their
negative
attack
.
but
the
challenge
faced
by
this
congress
is
more
menacing
than
merely
a
return
to
the
past—bad
a
that
would
be
.
our
resplendent
economic
autocracy
doe
not
want
to
return
to
that
individualism
of
which
they
prate
,
even
though
the
advantage
under
that
system
went
to
the
ruthless
and
the
strong
.
they
realize
that
in
thirty-four
month
we
have
built
up
new
instrument
of
public
power
.
in
the
hand
of
a
people
's
government
this
power
is
wholesome
and
proper
.
but
in
the
hand
of
political
puppet
of
an
economic
autocracy
such
power
would
provide
shackle
for
the
liberty
of
the
people
.
give
them
their
way
and
they
will
take
the
course
of
every
autocracy
of
the
past
—power
for
themselves
,
enslavement
for
the
public
.
their
weapon
is
the
weapon
of
fear
.
i
have
said
,
``
the
only
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
itself
.
''
that
is
a
true
today
a
it
wa
in
1933
.
but
such
fear
a
they
instill
today
is
not
a
natural
fear
,
a
normal
fear
;
it
is
a
synthetic
,
manufactured
,
poisonous
fear
that
is
being
spread
subtly
,
expensively
and
cleverly
by
the
same
people
who
cried
in
those
other
day
,
``
save
u
,
save
u
,
lest
we
perish
.
''
i
am
confident
that
the
congress
of
the
united
state
well
understands
the
fact
and
is
ready
to
wage
unceasing
warfare
against
those
who
seek
a
continuation
of
that
spirit
of
fear
.
the
carrying
out
of
the
law
of
the
land
a
enacted
by
the
congress
requires
protection
until
final
adjudication
by
the
highest
tribunal
of
the
land
.
the
congress
ha
the
right
and
can
find
the
mean
to
protect
it
own
prerogative
.
we
are
justified
in
our
present
confidence
.
restoration
of
national
income
,
which
show
continuing
gain
for
the
third
successive
year
,
support
the
normal
and
logical
policy
under
which
agriculture
and
industry
are
returning
to
full
activity
.
under
these
policy
we
approach
a
balance
of
the
national
budget
.
national
income
increase
;
tax
receipt
,
based
on
that
income
,
increase
without
the
levying
of
new
tax
.
that
is
why
i
am
able
to
say
to
this
,
the
second
session
of
the
74th
congress
,
that
it
is
my
belief
based
on
existing
law
that
no
new
tax
,
over
and
above
the
present
tax
,
are
either
advisable
or
necessary
.
national
income
increase
;
employment
increase
.
therefore
,
we
can
look
forward
to
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
those
citizen
who
are
in
need
.
therefore
,
also
,
we
can
anticipate
a
reduction
in
our
appropriation
for
relief
.
in
the
light
of
our
substantial
material
progress
,
in
the
light
of
the
increasing
effectiveness
of
the
restoration
of
popular
rule
,
i
recommend
to
the
congress
that
we
advance
;
that
we
do
not
retreat
.
i
have
confidence
that
you
will
not
fail
the
people
of
the
nation
whose
mandate
you
have
already
so
faithfully
fulfilled
.
i
repeat
,
with
the
same
faith
and
the
same
determination
,
my
word
of
march
4
,
1933
:
``
we
face
the
arduous
day
that
lie
before
u
in
the
warm
courage
of
national
unity
;
with
a
clear
consciousness
of
seeking
old
and
precious
moral
value
;
with
a
clean
satisfaction
that
come
from
the
stern
performance
of
duty
by
old
and
young
alike
.
we
aim
at
the
assurance
of
a
rounded
and
permanent
national
life
.
we
do
not
distrust
the
future
of
essential
democracy
.
''
i
can
not
better
end
this
message
on
the
state
of
the
union
than
by
repeating
the
word
of
a
wise
philosopher
at
whose
foot
i
sat
many
,
many
year
ago

``
