vice
president
biden
,
mr.
chief
justice
,
member
of
the
united
state
congress
,
distinguished
guest
,
and
fellow
citizen
:
each
time
we
gather
to
inaugurate
a
president
we
bear
witness
to
the
enduring
strength
of
our
constitution
.
we
affirm
the
promise
of
our
democracy
.
we
recall
that
what
bind
this
nation
together
is
not
the
color
of
our
skin
or
the
tenet
of
our
faith
or
the
origin
of
our
name
.
what
make
u
exceptional—what
make
u
american—is
our
allegiance
to
an
idea
articulated
in
a
declaration
made
more
than
two
century
ago
:
we
hold
these
truth
to
be
self-evident
,
that
all
men
are
created
equal
;
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
right
;
that
among
these
are
life
,
liberty
,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
.
today
we
continue
a
never-ending
journey
to
bridge
the
meaning
of
those
word
with
the
reality
of
our
time
.
for
history
tell
u
that
while
these
truth
may
be
self-evident
,
they
've
never
been
self-executing
;
that
while
freedom
is
a
gift
from
god
,
it
must
be
secured
by
his
people
here
on
earth
.
the
patriot
of
1776
did
not
fight
to
replace
the
tyranny
of
a
king
with
the
privilege
of
a
few
or
the
rule
of
a
mob
.
they
gave
to
u
a
republic
,
a
government
of
and
by
and
for
the
people
,
entrusting
each
generation
to
keep
safe
our
founding
creed
.
and
for
more
than
200
year
,
we
have
.
through
blood
drawn
by
lash
and
blood
drawn
by
sword
,
we
learned
that
no
union
founded
on
the
principle
of
liberty
and
equality
could
survive
half-slave
and
half-free
.
we
made
ourselves
anew
,
and
vowed
to
move
forward
together
.
together
,
we
determined
that
a
modern
economy
requires
railroad
and
highway
to
speed
travel
and
commerce
,
school
and
college
to
train
our
worker
.
together
,
we
discovered
that
a
free
market
only
thrives
when
there
are
rule
to
ensure
competition
and
fair
play
.
together
,
we
resolved
that
a
great
nation
must
care
for
the
vulnerable
and
protect
it
people
from
life
's
worst
hazard
and
misfortune
.
through
it
all
,
we
have
never
relinquished
our
skepticism
of
central
authority
nor
have
we
succumbed
to
the
fiction
that
all
society
's
ill
can
be
cured
through
government
alone
.
our
celebration
of
initiative
and
enterprise
,
our
insistence
on
hard
work
and
personal
responsibility
,
these
are
constant
in
our
character
.
but
we
have
always
understood
that
when
time
change
,
so
must
we
;
that
fidelity
to
our
founding
principle
requires
new
response
to
new
challenge
;
that
preserving
our
individual
freedom
ultimately
requires
collective
action
.
for
the
american
people
can
no
more
meet
the
demand
of
today
's
world
by
acting
alone
than
american
soldier
could
have
met
the
force
of
fascism
or
communism
with
musket
and
militia
.
no
single
person
can
train
all
the
math
and
science
teacher
we
'll
need
to
equip
our
child
for
the
future
,
or
build
the
road
and
network
and
research
lab
that
will
bring
new
job
and
business
to
our
shore
.
now
more
than
ever
,
we
must
do
these
thing
together
,
a
one
nation
and
one
people
.
this
generation
of
american
ha
been
tested
by
crisis
that
steeled
our
resolve
and
proved
our
resilience
.
a
decade
of
war
is
now
ending
.
an
economic
recovery
ha
begun
.
america
's
possibility
are
limitless
,
for
we
posse
all
the
quality
that
this
world
without
boundary
demand
:
youth
and
drive
;
diversity
and
openness
;
an
endless
capacity
for
risk
and
a
gift
for
reinvention
.
my
fellow
american
,
we
are
made
for
this
moment
and
we
will
seize
it—so
long
a
we
seize
it
together
.
for
we
,
the
people
,
understand
that
our
country
can
not
succeed
when
a
shrinking
few
do
very
well
and
a
growing
many
barely
make
it
.
we
believe
that
america
's
prosperity
must
rest
upon
the
broad
shoulder
of
a
rising
middle
class
.
we
know
that
america
thrives
when
every
person
can
find
independence
and
pride
in
their
work
;
when
the
wage
of
honest
labor
liberate
family
from
the
brink
of
hardship
.
we
are
true
to
our
creed
when
a
little
girl
born
into
the
bleakest
poverty
know
that
she
ha
the
same
chance
to
succeed
a
anybody
else
,
because
she
is
an
american
;
she
is
free
and
she
is
equal
,
not
just
in
the
eye
of
god
,
but
also
in
our
own
.
we
understand
that
outworn
program
are
inadequate
to
the
need
of
our
time
.
so
we
must
harness
new
idea
and
technology
to
remake
our
government
,
revamp
our
tax
code
,
reform
our
school
,
and
empower
our
citizen
with
the
skill
they
need
to
work
harder
,
learn
more
,
reach
higher
.
but
while
the
mean
will
change
,
our
purpose
endures
:
a
nation
that
reward
the
effort
and
determination
of
every
single
american
.
that
is
what
this
moment
requires
.
that
is
what
will
give
real
meaning
to
our
creed
.
we
,
the
people
,
still
believe
that
every
citizen
deserves
a
basic
measure
of
security
and
dignity
.
we
must
make
the
hard
choice
to
reduce
the
cost
of
health
care
and
the
size
of
our
deficit
.
but
we
reject
the
belief
that
america
must
choose
between
caring
for
the
generation
that
built
this
country
and
investing
in
the
generation
that
will
build
it
future
.
for
we
remember
the
lesson
of
our
past
,
when
twilight
year
were
spent
in
poverty
and
parent
of
a
child
with
a
disability
had
nowhere
to
turn
.
we
do
not
believe
that
in
this
country
freedom
is
reserved
for
the
lucky
,
or
happiness
for
the
few
.
we
recognize
that
no
matter
how
responsibly
we
live
our
life
,
any
one
of
u
at
any
time
may
face
a
job
loss
or
a
sudden
illness
or
a
home
swept
away
in
a
terrible
storm
.
the
commitment
we
make
to
each
other
through
medicare
and
medicaid
and
social
security
,
these
thing
do
not
sap
our
initiative
,
they
strengthen
u
.
they
do
not
make
u
a
nation
of
taker
;
they
free
u
to
take
the
risk
that
make
this
country
great
.
we
,
the
people
,
still
believe
that
our
obligation
a
american
are
not
just
to
ourselves
,
but
to
all
posterity
.
we
will
respond
to
the
threat
of
climate
change
,
knowing
that
the
failure
to
do
so
would
betray
our
child
and
future
generation
.
some
may
still
deny
the
overwhelming
judgment
of
science
,
but
none
can
avoid
the
devastating
impact
of
raging
fire
and
crippling
drought
and
more
powerful
storm
.
the
path
towards
sustainable
energy
source
will
be
long
and
sometimes
difficult
.
but
america
can
not
resist
this
transition
,
we
must
lead
it
.
we
can
not
cede
to
other
nation
the
technology
that
will
power
new
job
and
new
industry
,
we
must
claim
it
promise
.
that
's
how
we
will
maintain
our
economic
vitality
and
our
national
treasure—our
forest
and
waterway
,
our
crop
land
and
snow-capped
peak
.
that
is
how
we
will
preserve
our
planet
,
commanded
to
our
care
by
god
.
that
's
what
will
lend
meaning
to
the
creed
our
father
once
declared
.
we
,
the
people
,
still
believe
that
enduring
security
and
lasting
peace
do
not
require
perpetual
war
.
our
brave
men
and
woman
in
uniform
,
tempered
by
the
flame
of
battle
,
are
unmatched
in
skill
and
courage
.
our
citizen
,
seared
by
the
memory
of
those
we
have
lost
,
know
too
well
the
price
that
is
paid
for
liberty
.
the
knowledge
of
their
sacrifice
will
keep
u
forever
vigilant
against
those
who
would
do
u
harm
.
but
we
are
also
heir
to
those
who
won
the
peace
and
not
just
the
war
;
who
turned
sworn
enemy
into
the
surest
of
friends—and
we
must
carry
those
lesson
into
this
time
a
well
.
we
will
defend
our
people
and
uphold
our
value
through
strength
of
arm
and
rule
of
law
.
we
will
show
the
courage
to
try
and
resolve
our
difference
with
other
nation
peacefully—not
because
we
are
naive
about
the
danger
we
face
,
but
because
engagement
can
more
durably
lift
suspicion
and
fear
.
america
will
remain
the
anchor
of
strong
alliance
in
every
corner
of
the
globe
.
and
we
will
renew
those
institution
that
extend
our
capacity
to
manage
crisis
abroad
,
for
no
one
ha
a
greater
stake
in
a
peaceful
world
than
it
most
powerful
nation
.
we
will
support
democracy
from
asia
to
africa
,
from
the
america
to
the
middle
east
,
because
our
interest
and
our
conscience
compel
u
to
act
on
behalf
of
those
who
long
for
freedom
.
and
we
must
be
a
source
of
hope
to
the
poor
,
the
sick
,
the
marginalized
,
the
victim
of
prejudice—not
out
of
mere
charity
,
but
because
peace
in
our
time
requires
the
constant
advance
of
those
principle
that
our
common
creed
describes
:
tolerance
and
opportunity
,
human
dignity
and
justice
.
we
,
the
people
,
declare
today
that
the
most
evident
of
truths—that
all
of
u
are
created
equal—is
the
star
that
guide
u
still
;
just
a
it
guided
our
forebear
through
seneca
fall
and
selma
and
stonewall
;
just
a
it
guided
all
those
men
and
woman
,
sung
and
unsung
,
who
left
footprint
along
this
great
mall
,
to
hear
a
preacher
say
that
we
can
not
walk
alone
;
to
hear
a
king
proclaim
that
our
individual
freedom
is
inextricably
bound
to
the
freedom
of
every
soul
on
earth
.
it
is
now
our
generation
's
task
to
carry
on
what
those
pioneer
began
.
for
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
our
wife
,
our
mother
and
daughter
can
earn
a
living
equal
to
their
effort
.
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
our
gay
brother
and
sister
are
treated
like
anyone
else
under
the
law—for
if
we
are
truly
created
equal
,
then
surely
the
love
we
commit
to
one
another
must
be
equal
a
well
.
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
no
citizen
is
forced
to
wait
for
hour
to
exercise
the
right
to
vote
.
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
we
find
a
better
way
to
welcome
the
striving
,
hopeful
immigrant
who
still
see
america
a
a
land
of
opportunity—until
bright
young
student
and
engineer
are
enlisted
in
our
workforce
rather
than
expelled
from
our
country
.
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
all
our
child
,
from
the
street
of
detroit
to
the
hill
of
appalachia
,
to
the
quiet
lane
of
newtown
,
know
that
they
are
cared
for
and
cherished
and
always
safe
from
harm
.
that
is
our
generation
's
task—to
make
these
word
,
these
right
,
these
value
of
life
and
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
real
for
every
american
.
being
true
to
our
founding
document
doe
not
require
u
to
agree
on
every
contour
of
life
.
it
doe
not
mean
we
all
define
liberty
in
exactly
the
same
way
or
follow
the
same
precise
path
to
happiness
.
progress
doe
not
compel
u
to
settle
centuries-long
debate
about
the
role
of
government
for
all
time
,
but
it
doe
require
u
to
act
in
our
time
.
for
now
decision
are
upon
u
and
we
can
not
afford
delay
.
we
can
not
mistake
absolutism
for
principle
or
substitute
spectacle
for
politics
or
treat
name-calling
a
reasoned
debate
.
we
must
act
,
knowing
that
our
work
will
be
imperfect
.
we
must
act
,
we
must
act
knowing
that
today
's
victory
will
be
only
partial
and
that
it
will
be
up
to
those
who
stand
here
in
4
year
and
40
year
and
400
year
hence
to
advance
the
timeless
spirit
once
conferred
to
u
in
a
spare
philadelphia
hall
.
my
fellow
american
,
the
oath
i
have
sworn
before
you
today
,
like
the
one
recited
by
others
who
serve
in
this
capitol
,
wa
an
oath
to
god
and
country
,
not
party
or
faction
.
and
we
must
faithfully
execute
that
pledge
during
the
duration
of
our
service
.
but
the
word
i
spoke
today
are
not
so
different
from
the
oath
that
is
taken
each
time
a
soldier
sign
up
for
duty
or
an
immigrant
realizes
her
dream
.
my
oath
is
not
so
different
from
the
pledge
we
all
make
to
the
flag
that
wave
above
and
that
fill
our
heart
with
pride
.
they
are
the
word
of
citizen
and
they
represent
our
greatest
hope
.
you
and
i
,
a
citizen
,
have
the
power
to
set
this
country
's
course
.
you
and
i
,
a
citizen
,
have
the
obligation
to
shape
the
debate
of
our
time—not
only
with
the
vote
we
cast
,
but
with
the
voice
we
lift
in
defense
of
our
most
ancient
value
and
enduring
ideal
.
let
u
,
each
of
u
,
now
embrace
with
solemn
duty
and
awesome
joy
what
is
our
lasting
birthright
.
with
common
effort
and
common
purpose
,
with
passion
and
dedication
,
let
u
answer
the
call
of
history
and
carry
into
an
uncertain
future
that
precious
light
of
freedom
.
thank
you
.
god
bless
you
,
and
may
he
forever
bless
these
united
state
of
america
.
