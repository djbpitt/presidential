fellow-countrymen
:
at
this
second
appearing
to
take
the
oath
of
the
presidential
office
there
is
le
occasion
for
an
extended
address
than
there
wa
at
the
first
.
then
a
statement
somewhat
in
detail
of
a
course
to
be
pursued
seemed
fitting
and
proper
.
now
,
at
the
expiration
of
four
year
,
during
which
public
declaration
have
been
constantly
called
forth
on
every
point
and
phase
of
the
great
contest
which
still
absorbs
the
attention
and
engrosses
the
energy
of
the
nation
,
little
that
is
new
could
be
presented
.
the
progress
of
our
arm
,
upon
which
all
else
chiefly
depends
,
is
a
well
known
to
the
public
a
to
myself
,
and
it
is
,
i
trust
,
reasonably
satisfactory
and
encouraging
to
all
.
with
high
hope
for
the
future
,
no
prediction
in
regard
to
it
is
ventured
.
on
the
occasion
corresponding
to
this
four
year
ago
all
thought
were
anxiously
directed
to
an
impending
civil
war
.
all
dreaded
it
,
all
sought
to
avert
it
.
while
the
inaugural
address
wa
being
delivered
from
this
place
,
devoted
altogether
to
saving
the
union
without
war
,
insurgent
agent
were
in
the
city
seeking
to
destroy
it
without
war-seeking
to
dissolve
the
union
and
divide
effect
by
negotiation
.
both
party
deprecated
war
,
but
one
of
them
would
make
war
rather
than
let
the
nation
survive
,
and
the
other
would
accept
war
rather
than
let
it
perish
,
and
the
war
came
.
one-eighth
of
the
whole
population
were
colored
slave
,
not
distributed
generally
over
the
union
.
but
localized
in
the
southern
part
of
it
.
these
slave
constituted
a
peculiar
and
powerful
interest
.
all
knew
that
this
interest
wa
somehow
the
cause
of
the
war
.
to
strengthen
,
perpetuate
,
and
extend
this
interest
wa
the
object
for
which
the
insurgent
would
rend
the
union
even
by
war
,
while
the
government
claimed
no
right
to
do
more
than
to
restrict
the
territorial
enlargement
of
it
.
neither
party
expected
for
the
war
the
magnitude
or
the
duration
which
it
ha
already
attained
.
neither
anticipated
that
the
cause
of
the
conflict
might
cease
with
or
even
before
the
conflict
itself
should
cease
.
each
looked
for
an
easier
triumph
,
and
a
result
le
fundamental
and
astounding
.
both
read
the
same
bible
and
pray
to
the
same
god
,
and
each
invokes
his
aid
against
the
other
.
it
may
seem
strange
that
any
men
should
dare
to
ask
a
just
god
's
assistance
in
wringing
their
bread
from
the
sweat
of
other
men
's
face
,
but
let
u
judge
not
,
that
we
be
not
judged
.
the
prayer
of
both
could
not
be
answered
.
that
of
neither
ha
been
answered
fully
.
the
almighty
ha
his
own
purpose
.
``
woe
unto
the
world
because
of
offense
;
for
it
must
need
be
that
offense
come
,
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offense
cometh
.
''
if
we
shall
suppose
that
american
slavery
is
one
of
those
offense
which
,
in
the
providence
of
god
,
must
need
come
,
but
which
,
having
continued
through
his
appointed
time
,
he
now
will
to
remove
,
and
that
he
give
to
both
north
and
south
this
terrible
war
a
the
woe
due
to
those
by
whom
the
offense
came
,
shall
we
discern
therein
any
departure
from
those
divine
attribute
which
the
believer
in
a
living
god
always
ascribe
to
him
?
fondly
do
we
hope
,
fervently
do
we
pray
,
that
this
mighty
scourge
of
war
may
speedily
pas
away
.
yet
,
if
god
will
that
it
continue
until
all
the
wealth
piled
by
the
bondsman
's
two
hundred
and
fifty
year
of
unrequited
toil
shall
be
sunk
,
and
until
every
drop
of
blood
drawn
with
the
lash
shall
be
paid
by
another
drawn
with
the
sword
,
a
wa
said
three
thousand
year
ago
,
so
still
it
must
be
said
``
the
judgment
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether
.
''
with
malice
toward
none
,
with
charity
for
all
,
with
firmness
in
the
fight
a
god
give
u
to
see
the
right
,
let
u
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in
,
to
bind
up
the
nation's
wound
,
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow
and
his
orphan
,
to
do
all
which
may
achieve
and
cherish
a
just
and
lasting
peace
among
ourselves
and
with
all
nation
.
