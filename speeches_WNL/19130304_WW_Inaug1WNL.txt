there
ha
been
a
change
of
government
.
it
began
two
year
ago
,
whenthe
house
of
representative
became
democratic
by
a
decisive
majority.it
ha
now
been
completed
.
the
senate
about
to
assemble
will
also
be
democratic.the
office
of
president
and
vice-president
have
been
put
into
the
handsof
democrat
.
what
doe
the
change
mean
?
that
is
the
question
that
is
uppermostin
our
mind
to-day
.
that
is
the
question
i
am
going
to
try
to
answer
,
in
order
,
if
i
may
,
to
interpret
the
occasion
.
it
mean
much
more
than
the
mere
success
of
a
party
.
the
success
ofa
party
mean
little
except
when
the
nation
is
using
that
party
for
a
largeand
definite
purpose
.
no
one
can
mistake
the
purpose
for
which
the
nationnow
seek
to
use
the
democratic
party
.
it
seek
to
use
it
to
interpreta
change
in
it
own
plan
and
point
of
view
.
some
old
thing
with
whichwe
had
grown
familiar
,
and
which
had
begun
to
creep
into
the
very
habitof
our
thought
and
of
our
life
,
have
altered
their
aspect
a
we
have
latterlylooked
critically
upon
them
,
with
fresh
,
awakened
eye
;
have
dropped
theirdisguises
and
shown
themselves
alien
and
sinister
.
some
new
thing
,
aswe
look
frankly
upon
them
,
willing
to
comprehend
their
real
character
,
have
come
to
assume
the
aspect
of
thing
long
believed
in
and
familiar
,
stuff
of
our
own
conviction
.
we
have
been
refreshed
by
a
new
insight
intoour
own
life
.
we
see
that
in
many
thing
that
life
is
very
great
.
it
is
incomparablygreat
in
it
material
aspect
,
in
it
body
of
wealth
,
in
the
diversityand
sweep
of
it
energy
,
in
the
industry
which
have
been
conceived
andbuilt
up
by
the
genius
of
individual
men
and
the
limitless
enterprise
ofgroups
of
men
.
it
is
great
,
also
,
very
great
,
in
it
moral
force
.
nowhereelse
in
the
world
have
noble
men
and
woman
exhibited
in
more
striking
formsthe
beauty
and
the
energy
of
sympathy
and
helpfulness
and
counsel
in
theirefforts
to
rectify
wrong
,
alleviate
suffering
,
and
set
the
weak
in
theway
of
strength
and
hope
.
we
have
built
up
,
moreover
,
a
great
system
ofgovernment
,
which
ha
stood
through
a
long
age
a
in
many
respect
a
modelfor
those
who
seek
to
set
liberty
upon
foundation
that
will
endure
againstfortuitous
change
,
against
storm
and
accident
.
our
life
contains
everygreat
thing
,
and
contains
it
in
rich
abundance
.
but
the
evil
ha
come
with
the
good
,
and
much
fine
gold
ha
been
corroded.with
rich
ha
come
inexcusable
waste
.
we
have
squandered
a
great
partof
what
we
might
have
used
,
and
have
not
stopped
to
conserve
the
exceedingbounty
of
nature
,
without
which
our
genius
for
enterprise
would
have
beenworthless
and
impotent
,
scorning
to
be
careful
,
shamefully
prodigal
aswell
a
admirably
efficient
.
we
have
been
proud
of
our
industrial
achievement
,
but
we
have
not
hitherto
stopped
thoughtfully
enough
to
count
the
humancost
,
the
cost
of
life
snuffed
out
,
of
energy
overtaxed
and
broken
,
the
fearful
physical
and
spiritual
cost
to
the
men
and
woman
and
childrenupon
whom
the
dead
weight
and
burden
of
it
all
ha
fallen
pitilessly
theyears
through
.
the
groan
and
agony
of
it
all
had
not
yet
reached
our
ear
,
the
solemn
,
moving
undertone
of
our
life
,
coming
up
out
of
the
mine
andfactories
,
and
out
of
every
home
where
the
struggle
had
it
intimate
andfamiliar
seat
.
with
the
great
government
went
many
deep
secret
thing
whichwe
too
long
delayed
to
look
into
and
scrutinize
with
candid
,
fearless
eyes.the
great
government
we
loved
ha
too
often
been
made
use
of
for
privateand
selfish
purpose
,
and
those
who
used
it
had
forgotten
the
people
.
at
last
a
vision
ha
been
vouchsafed
u
of
our
life
a
a
whole
.
we
seethe
bad
with
the
good
,
the
debased
and
decadent
with
the
sound
and
vital.with
this
vision
we
approach
new
affair
.
our
duty
is
to
cleanse
,
to
reconsider
,
to
restore
,
to
correct
the
evil
without
impairing
the
good
,
to
purify
andhumanize
every
process
of
our
common
life
without
weakening
or
sentimentalizingit
.
there
ha
been
something
crude
and
heartless
and
unfeeling
in
our
hasteto
succeed
and
be
great
.
our
thought
ha
been
``
let
every
man
look
out
forhimself
,
let
every
generation
look
out
for
itself
,
''
while
we
reared
giantmachinery
which
made
it
impossible
that
any
but
those
who
stood
at
thelevers
of
control
should
have
a
chance
to
look
out
for
themselves
.
we
hadnot
forgotten
our
moral
.
we
remembered
well
enough
that
we
had
set
upa
policy
which
wa
meant
to
serve
the
humblest
a
well
a
the
most
powerful
,
with
an
eye
single
to
the
standard
of
justice
and
fair
play
,
and
rememberedit
with
pride
.
but
we
were
very
heedless
and
in
a
hurry
to
be
great
.
we
have
come
now
to
the
sober
second
thought
.
the
scale
of
heedlessnesshave
fallen
from
our
eye
.
we
have
made
up
our
mind
to
square
every
processof
our
national
life
again
with
the
standard
we
so
proudly
set
up
at
thebeginning
and
have
always
carried
at
our
heart
.
our
work
is
a
work
ofrestoration
.
we
have
itemized
with
some
degree
of
particularity
the
thing
that
oughtto
be
altered
and
here
are
some
of
the
chief
item
:
a
tariff
which
cutsus
off
from
our
proper
part
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
,
violates
thejust
principle
of
taxation
,
and
make
the
government
a
facile
instrumentin
the
hand
of
private
interest
;
a
banking
and
currency
system
based
uponthe
necessity
of
the
government
to
sell
it
bond
fifty
year
ago
and
perfectlyadapted
to
concentrating
cash
and
restricting
credit
;
an
industrial
systemwhich
,
take
it
on
all
it
side
,
financial
a
well
a
administrative
,
holdscapital
in
leading
string
,
restricts
the
liberty
and
limit
the
opportunitiesof
labor
,
and
exploit
without
renewing
or
conserving
the
natural
resourcesof
the
country
;
a
body
of
agricultural
activity
never
yet
given
the
efficiencyof
great
business
undertaking
or
served
a
it
should
be
through
the
instrumentalityof
science
taken
directly
to
the
farm
,
or
afforded
the
facility
of
creditbest
suited
to
it
practical
need
;

,
waste
placesunreclaimed
,
forest
untended
,
fast
disappearing
without
plan
or
prospectof

,
unregarded
waste

at
every
mine
.
we
have
studied
a
perhapsno
other
nation
ha
the
most
effective
mean
of
production
,
but
we
havenot
studied
cost
or
economy
a
we
should
either
a
organizer
of
industry
,
a
statesman
,
or
a
individual
.
nor
have
we
studied
and
perfected
the
mean
by
which
government
maybe
put
at
the
service
of
humanity
,
in
safeguarding
the
health
of
the
nation
,
the
health
of
it
men
and
it
woman
and
it
child
,
a
well
a
theirrights
in
the
struggle
for
existence
.
this
is
no
sentimental
duty
.
thefirm
basis
of
government
is
justice
,
not
pity
.
these
are
matter
of
justice.there
can
be
no
equality
or
opportunity
,
the
first
essential
of
justicein
the
body
politic
,
if
men
and
woman
and
child
be
not
shielded
in
theirlives
,
their
very
vitality
,
from
the
consequence
of
great
industrial
andsocial
process
which
they
can
not
alter
,
control
,
or
singly
cope
with.society
must
see
to
it
that
it
doe
not
itself
crush
or
weaken
or
damageits
own
constituent
part
.
the
first
duty
of
law
is
to
keep
sound

societyit

,
and
law

labor
which
individual
are
powerless
to
determine
for
themselves
areintimate
part
of
the
very
business
of
justice
and
legal
efficiency
.
these
are
some
of
the
thing
we
ought
to
do
,
and
not
leave
the
othersundone
,
the
old-fashioned
,
never-to-be-neglected
,
fundamental
safeguardingof
property
and
of
individual
right
.
this
is
the
high
enterprise
of
thenew
day
:
to
lift
everything
that
concern
our
life
a
a
nation
to
the
lightthat
shine
from
the
hearthfire
of
every
man's
conscience
and
vision
ofthe
right
.
it
is
inconceivable
that
we
should
do
this
a
partisan
;
itis
inconceivable
we
should
do
it
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
a
they
areor
in
blind
haste
.
we
shall
restore
,
not
destroy
.
we
shall
deal
with
oureconomic
system
a
it
is
and
a
it
may
be
modified
,
not
a
it
might
beif
we
had
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
to
write
upon
;
and
step
by
step
we
shallmake
it
what
it
should
be
,
in
the
spirit
of
those
who
question
their
ownwisdom
and
seek
counsel
and
knowledge
,
not
shallow
self-satisfaction
orthe
excitement
of
excursion
whither
they
can
not
tell
.
justice
,
and
onlyjustice
,
shall
always
be
our
motto
.
and
yet
it
will
be
no
cool
process
of
mere
science
.
the
nation
ha
beendeeply
stirred
,
stirred
by
a
solemn
passion
,
stirred
by
the
knowledge
ofwrong
,
of
ideal
lost
,
of
government
too
often
debauched
and
made
an
instrumentof
evil
.
the
feeling
with
which
we
face
this
new
age
of
right
and
opportunitysweep
across
our
heartstrings
like
some
air
out
of
god
's
own
presence
,
where
justice
and
mercy
are
reconciled
and
the
judge
and
the
brother
areone
.
we
know
our
task
to
be
no
mere
task
of
politics
but
a
task
which
shallsearch

whether
we
be
able

the
need
of
our

,
whether
we

the
pure

to

and
the
