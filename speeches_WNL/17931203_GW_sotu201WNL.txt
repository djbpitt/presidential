fellow-citizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representative
:
since
the
commencement
of
the
term
for
which
i
have
been
again
called
into
office
no
fit
occasion
ha
arisen
for
expressing
to
me
fellow
citizen
at
large
the
deep
and
respectful
sense
which
i
feel
of
the
renewed
testimony
of
public
approbation
.
while
on
the
one
hand
it
awakened
my
gratitude
for
all
those
instance
of
affectionate
partiality
with
which
i
have
been
honored
by
my
country
,
on
the
other
it
could
not
prevent
an
earnest
wish
for
that
retirement
from
which
no
private
consideration
should
ever
have
torn
me
.
but
influenced
by
the
belief
that
my
conduct
would
be
estimated
according
to
it
real
motif
,
and
that
the
people
,
and
the
authority
derived
from
them
,
would
support
exertion
having
nothing
personal
for
their
object
,
i
have
obeyed
the
suffrage
which
commanded
me
to
resume
the
executive
power
;
and
i
humbly
implore
that
being
on
whose
will
the
fate
of
nation
depends
to
crown
with
success
our
mutual
endeavor
for
the
general
happiness
.
a
soon
a
the
war
in
europe
had
embraced
those
power
with
whom
the
united
state
have
the
most
extensive
relation
there
wa
reason
to
apprehend
that
our
intercourse
with
them
might
be
interrupted
and
our
disposition
for
peace
drawn
into
question
by
the
suspicion
too
often
entertained
by
belligerent
nation
.
it
seemed
,
therefore
,
to
be
my
duty
to
admonish
our
citizen
of
the
consequence
of
a
contraband
trade
and
of
hostile
act
to
any
of
the
party
,
and
to
obtain
by
a
declaration
of
the
existing
legal
state
of
thing
an
easier
admission
of
our
right
to
the
immunity
belonging
to
our
situation
.
under
these
impression
the
proclamation
which
will
be
laid
before
you
wa
issued
.
in
this
posture
of
affair
,
both
new
and
delicate
,
i
resolved
to
adopt
general
rule
which
should
conform
to
the
treaty
and
assert
the
privilege
of
the
united
state
.
these
were
reduced
into
a
system
,
which
will
be
communicated
to
you
.
although
i
have
not
thought
of
myself
at
liberty
to
forbid
the
sale
of
the
prize
permitted
by
our
treaty
of
commerce
with
france
to
be
brought
into
our
port
,
i
have
not
refused
to
cause
them
to
be
restored
when
they
were
taken
within
the
protection
of
our
territory
,
or
by
vessel
commissioned
or
equipped
in
a
warlike
form
within
the
limit
of
the
united
state
.
it
rest
with
the
wisdom
of
congress
to
correct
,
improve
,
or
enforce
this
plan
of
procedure
;
and
it
will
probably
be
found
expedient
to
extend
the
legal
code
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
the
united
state
to
many
case
which
,
though
dependent
on
principle
already
recognized
,
demand
some
further
provision
.
where
individual
shall
,
within
the
united
state
,
array
themselves
in
hostility
against
any
of
the
power
at
war
,
or
enter
upon
military
expedition
or
enterprise
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
state
,
or
usurp
and
exercise
judicial
authority
within
the
united
state
,
or
where
the
penalty
on
violation
of
the
law
of
nation
may
have
been
indistinctly
marked
,
or
are
inadequate
-
these
offense
can
not
receive
too
early
and
close
an
attention
,
and
require
prompt
and
decisive
remedy
.
whatsoever
those
remedy
may
be
,
they
will
be
well
administered
by
the
judiciary
,
who
posse
a
long-established
course
of
investigation
,
effectual
process
,
and
officer
in
the
habit
of
executing
it
.
in
like
manner
,
a
several
of
the
court
have
doubted
,
under
particular
circumstance
,
their
power
to
liberate
the
vessel
of
a
nation
at
peace
,
and
even
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
state
,
although
seized
under
a
false
color
of
being
hostile
property
,
and
have
denied
their
power
to
liberate
certain
capture
within
the
protection
of
our
territory
,
it
would
seem
proper
to
regulate
their
jurisdiction
in
these
point
.
but
if
the
executive
is
to
be
the
resort
in
either
of
the
two
last-mentioned
case
,
it
is
hoped
that
he
will
be
authorized
by
law
to
have
fact
ascertained
by
the
court
when
for
his
own
information
he
shall
request
it
.
i
can
not
recommend
to
your
notice
measure
for
the
fulfillment
of
our
duty
to
the
rest
of
the
world
without
again
pressing
upon
you
the
necessity
of
placing
ourselves
in
a
condition
of
complete
defense
and
of
exacting
from
them
the
fulfillment
of
their
duty
toward
u
.
the
united
state
ought
not
to
indulge
a
persuasion
that
,
contrary
to
the
order
of
human
event
,
they
will
forever
keep
at
a
distance
those
painful
appeal
to
arm
with
which
the
history
of
every
other
nation
abounds
.
there
is
a
rank
due
to
the
united
state
among
nation
which
will
be
withheld
,
if
not
absolutely
lost
,
by
the
reputation
of
weakness
.
if
we
desire
to
avoid
insult
,
we
must
be
able
to
repel
it
;
if
we
desire
to
secure
peace
,
one
of
the
most
powerful
instrument
of
our
rising
prosperity
,
it
must
be
known
that
we
are
at
all
time
ready
for
war
.
the
document
which
will
be
presented
to
you
will
shew
the
amount
and
kind
of
arm
and
military
store
now
in
our
magazine
and
arsenal
;
and
yet
an
addition
even
to
these
supply
can
not
with
prudence
be
neglected
,
a
it
would
leave
nothing
to
the
uncertainty
of
procuring
warlike
apparatus
in
the
moment
of
public
danger
.
nor
can
such
arrangement
,
with
such
object
,
be
exposed
to
the
censure
or
jealousy
of
the
warmest
friend
of
republican
government
.
they
are
incapable
of
abuse
in
the
hand
of
the
militia
,
who
ought
to
posse
a
pride
in
being
the
depository
of
the
force
of
the
republic
,
and
may
be
trained
to
a
degree
of
energy
equal
to
every
military
exigency
of
the
united
state
.
but
it
is
an
inquiry
which
can
not
be
too
solemnly
pursued
,
whether
the
act
``
more
effectually
to
provide
for
the
national
defense
by
establishing
an
uniform
militia
throughout
the
united
state
''
ha
organized
them
so
a
to
produce
their
full
effect
;
whether
your
own
experience
in
the
several
state
ha
not
detected
some
imperfection
in
the
scheme
,
and
whether
a
material
feature
in
an
improvement
of
it
ought
not
to
be
to
afford
an
opportunity
for
the
study
of
those
branch
of
the
military
art
which
can
scarcely
ever
be
attained
by
practice
alone
.
the
connection
of
the
united
state
with
europe
ha
become
extremely
interesting
.
the
occurrence
which
relate
to
it
and
have
passed
under
the
knowledge
of
the
executive
will
be
exhibited
to
congress
in
a
subsequent
communication
.
when
we
contemplate
the
war
on
our
frontier
,
it
may
be
truly
affirmed
that
every
reasonable
effort
ha
been
made
to
adjust
the
cause
of
dissension
with
the
indian
north
of
the
ohio
.
the
instruction
given
to
the
commissioner
evince
a
moderation
and
equity
proceeding
from
a
sincere
love
of
peace
,
and
a
liberality
having
no
restriction
but
the
essential
interest
and
dignity
of
the
united
state
.
the
attempt
,
however
,
of
an
amicable
negotiation
having
been
frustrated
,
the
troop
have
marched
to
act
offensively
.
although
the
proposed
treaty
did
not
arrest
the
progress
of
military
preparation
,
it
is
doubtful
how
far
the
advance
of
the
season
,
before
good
faith
justified
active
movement
,
may
retard
them
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
.
from
the
paper
and
intelligence
which
relate
to
this
important
subject
you
will
determine
whether
the
deficiency
in
the
number
of
troop
granted
by
law
shall
be
compensated
by
succor
of
militia
,
or
additional
encouragement
shall
be
proposed
to
recruit
.
an
anxiety
ha
been
also
demonstrated
by
the
executive
for
peace
with
the
creek
and
the
cherokee
.
the
former
have
been
relieved
with
corn
and
with
clothing
,
and
offensive
measure
against
them
prohibited
during
the
recess
of
congress
.
to
satisfy
the
complaint
of
the
latter
,
prosecution
have
been
instituted
for
the
violence
committed
upon
them
.
but
the
paper
which
will
be
delivered
to
you
disclose
the
critical
footing
on
which
we
stand
in
regard
to
both
those
tribe
,
and
it
is
with
congress
to
pronounce
what
shall
be
done
.
after
they
shall
have
provided
for
the
present
emergency
,
it
will
merit
their
most
serious
labor
to
render
tranquillity
with
the
savage
permanent
by
creating
tie
of
interest
.
next
to
a
rigorous
execution
of
justice
on
the
violator
of
peace
,
the
establishment
of
commerce
with
the
indian
nation
in
behalf
of
the
united
state
is
most
likely
to
conciliate
their
attachment
.
but
it
ought
to
be
conducted
without
fraud
,
without
extortion
,
with
constant
and
plentiful
supply
,
with
a
ready
market
for
the
commodity
of
the
indian
and
a
stated
price
for
what
they
give
in
payment
and
receive
in
exchange
.
individual
will
not
pursue
such
a
traffic
unless
they
be
allured
by
the
hope
of
profit
;
but
it
will
be
enough
for
the
united
state
to
be
reimbursed
only
.
should
this
recommendation
accord
with
the
opinion
of
congress
,
they
will
recollect
that
it
can
not
be
accomplished
by
any
mean
yet
in
the
hand
of
the
executive
.
gentleman
of
the
house
of
representative
:
the
commissioner
charged
with
the
settlement
of
account
between
the
united
state
and
individual
state
concluded
their
important
function
within
the
time
limited
by
law
,
and
the
balance
struck
in
their
report
,
which
will
be
laid
before
congress
,
have
been
placed
on
the
book
of
the
treasury
.
on
the
first
day
of
june
last
an
installment
of
1,000,000
florin
became
payable
on
the
loan
of
the
united
state
in
holland
.
this
wa
adjusted
by
a
prolongation
of
the
period
of
reimbursement
in
nature
of
a
new
loan
at
an
interest
of
5
%
for
the
term
of
ten
year
,
and
the
expense
of
this
operation
were
a
commission
of
3
%
.
the
first
installment
of
the
loan
of
$
2,000,000
from
the
bank
of
the
united
state
ha
been
paid
,
a
wa
directed
by
law
.
for
the
second
it
is
necessary
that
provision
be
made
.
no
pecuniary
consideration
is
more
urgent
than
the
regular
redemption
and
discharge
of
the
public
debt
.
on
none
can
delay
be
more
injurious
or
an
economy
of
time
more
valuable
.
the
productiveness
of
the
public
revenue
hitherto
ha
continued
to
equal
the
anticipation
which
were
formed
of
it
,
but
it
is
not
expected
to
prove
commensurate
with
all
the
object
which
have
been
suggested
.
some
auxiliary
provision
will
therefore
,
it
is
presumed
,
be
requisite
,
and
it
is
hoped
that
these
may
be
made
consistently
with
a
due
regard
to
the
convenience
of
our
citizen
,
who
can
not
but
be
sensible
of
the
true
wisdom
of
encountering
a
small
present
addition
to
their
contribution
to
obviate
a
future
accumulation
of
burthen
.
but
here
i
can
not
forbear
to
recommend
a
repeal
of
the
tax
on
the
transportation
of
public
print
.
there
is
no
resource
so
firm
for
the
government
of
the
united
state
a
the
affection
of
the
people
,
guided
by
an
enlightened
policy
;
and
to
this
primary
good
nothing
can
conduce
more
than
a
faithful
representation
of
public
proceeding
,
diffused
without
restraint
throughout
the
united
state
.
an
estimate
of
the
appropriation
necessary
for
the
current
service
of
the
ensuing
year
and
a
statement
of
a
purchase
of
arm
and
military
store
made
during
the
recess
will
be
presented
to
congress
.
gentleman
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representative
:
the
several
subject
to
which
i
have
now
referred
open
a
wide
range
to
your
deliberation
and
involve
some
of
the
choicest
interest
of
our
common
country
.
permit
me
to
bring
to
your
remembrance
the
magnitude
of
your
task
.
without
an
unprejudiced
coolness
the
welfare
of
the
government
may
be
hazarded
;
without
harmony
a
far
a
consists
with
freedom
of
sentiment
it
dignity
may
be
lost
.
but
a
the
legislative
proceeding
of
the
united
state
will
never
,
i
trust
,
be
reproached
for
the
want
of
temper
or
of
candor
,
so
shall
not
the
public
happiness
languish
from
the
want
of
my
strenuous
and
warmest
cooperation
.
