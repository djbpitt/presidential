mr.
president
,
mr.
speaker
,
member
of
the
seventy-seventh
congress
:
i
address
you
,
the
member
of
the
seventy-seventh
congress
,
at
a
moment
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
union
.
i
use
the
word
``
unprecedented
,
''
because
at
no
previous
time
ha
american
security
been
a
seriously
threatened
from
without
a
it
is
today
.
since
the
permanent
formation
of
our
government
under
the
constitution
,
in
1789
,
most
of
the
period
of
crisis
in
our
history
have
related
to
our
domestic
affair
.
fortunately
,
only
one
of
these—the
four-year
war
between
the
states—ever
threatened
our
national
unity
.
today
,
thank
god
,
one
hundred
and
thirty
million
american
,
in
forty-eight
state
,
have
forgotten
point
of
the
compass
in
our
national
unity
.
it
is
true
that
prior
to
1914
the
united
state
often
had
been
disturbed
by
event
in
other
continent
.
we
had
even
engaged
in
two
war
with
european
nation
and
in
a
number
of
undeclared
war
in
the
west
indie
,
in
the
mediterranean
and
in
the
pacific
for
the
maintenance
of
american
right
and
for
the
principle
of
peaceful
commerce
.
but
in
no
case
had
a
serious
threat
been
raised
against
our
national
safety
or
our
continued
independence
.
what
i
seek
to
convey
is
the
historic
truth
that
the
united
state
a
a
nation
ha
at
all
time
maintained
clear
,
definite
opposition
,
to
any
attempt
to
lock
u
in
behind
an
ancient
chinese
wall
while
the
procession
of
civilization
went
past
.
today
,
thinking
of
our
child
and
of
their
child
,
we
oppose
enforced
isolation
for
ourselves
or
for
any
other
part
of
the
america
.
that
determination
of
ours
,
extending
over
all
these
year
,
wa
proved
,
for
example
,
during
the
quarter
century
of
war
following
the
french
revolution
.
while
the
napoleonic
struggle
did
threaten
interest
of
the
united
state
because
of
the
french
foothold
in
the
west
indie
and
in
louisiana
,
and
while
we
engaged
in
the
war
of
1812
to
vindicate
our
right
to
peaceful
trade
,
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
neither
france
nor
great
britain
,
nor
any
other
nation
,
wa
aiming
at
domination
of
the
whole
world
.
in
like
fashion
from
1815
to
1914—
ninety-nine
years—
no
single
war
in
europe
or
in
asia
constituted
a
real
threat
against
our
future
or
against
the
future
of
any
other
american
nation
.
except
in
the
maximilian
interlude
in
mexico
,
no
foreign
power
sought
to
establish
itself
in
this
hemisphere
;
and
the
strength
of
the
british
fleet
in
the
atlantic
ha
been
a
friendly
strength
.
it
is
still
a
friendly
strength
.
even
when
the
world
war
broke
out
in
1914
,
it
seemed
to
contain
only
small
threat
of
danger
to
our
own
american
future
.
but
,
a
time
went
on
,
the
american
people
began
to
visualize
what
the
downfall
of
democratic
nation
might
mean
to
our
own
democracy
.
we
need
not
overemphasize
imperfection
in
the
peace
of
versailles
.
we
need
not
harp
on
failure
of
the
democracy
to
deal
with
problem
of
world
reconstruction
.
we
should
remember
that
the
peace
of
1919
wa
far
le
unjust
than
the
kind
of
``
pacification
''
which
began
even
before
munich
,
and
which
is
being
carried
on
under
the
new
order
of
tyranny
that
seek
to
spread
over
every
continent
today
.
the
american
people
have
unalterably
set
their
face
against
that
tyranny
.
every
realist
know
that
the
democratic
way
of
life
is
at
this
moment
being
'
directly
assailed
in
every
part
of
the
world—assailed
either
by
arm
,
or
by
secret
spreading
of
poisonous
propaganda
by
those
who
seek
to
destroy
unity
and
promote
discord
in
nation
that
are
still
at
peace
.
during
sixteen
long
month
this
assault
ha
blotted
out
the
whole
pattern
of
democratic
life
in
an
appalling
number
of
independent
nation
,
great
and
small
.
the
assailant
are
still
on
the
march
,
threatening
other
nation
,
great
and
small
.
therefore
,
a
your
president
,
performing
my
constitutional
duty
to
``
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
,
''
i
find
it
,
unhappily
,
necessary
to
report
that
the
future
and
the
safety
of
our
country
and
of
our
democracy
are
overwhelmingly
involved
in
event
far
beyond
our
border
.
armed
defense
of
democratic
existence
is
now
being
gallantly
waged
in
four
continent
.
if
that
defense
fails
,
all
the
population
and
all
the
resource
of
europe
,
asia
,
africa
and
australasia
will
be
dominated
by
the
conqueror
.
let
u
remember
that
the
total
of
those
population
and
their
resource
in
those
four
continent
greatly
exceeds
the
sum
total
of
the
population
and
the
resource
of
the
whole
of
the
western
hemisphere-many
time
over
.
in
time
like
these
it
is
immature—and
incidentally
,
untrue—for
anybody
to
brag
that
an
unprepared
america
,
single-handed
,
and
with
one
hand
tied
behind
it
back
,
can
hold
off
the
whole
world
.
no
realistic
american
can
expect
from
a
dictator
's
peace
international
generosity
,
or
return
of
true
independence
,
or
world
disarmament
,
or
freedom
of
expression
,
or
freedom
of
religion
-or
even
good
business
.
such
a
peace
would
bring
no
security
for
u
or
for
our
neighbor
.
``
those
,
who
would
give
up
essential
liberty
to
purchase
a
little
temporary
safety
,
deserve
neither
liberty
nor
safety
.
''
a
a
nation
,
we
may
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
we
are
softhearted
;
but
we
can
not
afford
to
be
soft-headed
.
we
must
always
be
wary
of
those
who
with
sounding
brass
and
a
tinkling
cymbal
preach
the
``
ism
''
of
appeasement
.
we
must
especially
beware
of
that
small
group
of
selfish
men
who
would
clip
the
wing
of
the
american
eagle
in
order
to
feather
their
own
nest
.
i
have
recently
pointed
out
how
quickly
the
tempo
of
modern
warfare
could
bring
into
our
very
midst
the
physical
attack
which
we
must
eventually
expect
if
the
dictator
nation
win
this
war
.
there
is
much
loose
talk
of
our
immunity
from
immediate
and
direct
invasion
from
across
the
sea
.
obviously
,
a
long
a
the
british
navy
retains
it
power
,
no
such
danger
exists
.
even
if
there
were
no
british
navy
,
it
is
not
probable
that
any
enemy
would
be
stupid
enough
to
attack
u
by
landing
troop
in
the
united
state
from
across
thousand
of
mile
of
ocean
,
until
it
had
acquired
strategic
base
from
which
to
operate
.
but
we
learn
much
from
the
lesson
of
the
past
year
in
europe-particularly
the
lesson
of
norway
,
whose
essential
seaport
were
captured
by
treachery
and
surprise
built
up
over
a
series
of
year
.
the
first
phase
of
the
invasion
of
this
hemisphere
would
not
be
the
landing
of
regular
troop
.
the
necessary
strategic
point
would
be
occupied
by
secret
agent
and
their
dupes-
and
great
number
of
them
are
already
here
,
and
in
latin
america
.
a
long
a
the
aggressor
nation
maintain
the
offensive
,
they-not
we—will
choose
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
method
of
their
attack
.
that
is
why
the
future
of
all
the
american
republic
is
today
in
serious
danger
.
that
is
why
this
annual
message
to
the
congress
is
unique
in
our
history
.
that
is
why
every
member
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
every
member
of
the
congress
face
great
responsibility
and
great
accountability
.
the
need
of
the
moment
is
that
our
action
and
our
policy
should
be
devoted
primarily-almost
exclusively—to
meeting
this
foreign
peril
.
for
all
our
domestic
problem
are
now
a
part
of
the
great
emergency
.
just
a
our
national
policy
in
internal
affair
ha
been
based
upon
a
decent
respect
for
the
right
and
the
dignity
of
all
our
fellow
men
within
our
gate
,
so
our
national
policy
in
foreign
affair
ha
been
based
on
a
decent
respect
for
the
right
and
dignity
of
all
nation
,
large
and
small
.
and
the
justice
of
morality
must
and
will
win
in
the
end
.
our
national
policy
is
this
:
first
,
by
an
impressive
expression
of
the
public
will
and
without
regard
to
partisanship
,
we
are
committed
to
all-inclusive
national
defense
.
second
,
by
an
impressive
expression
of
the
public
will
and
without
regard
to
partisanship
,
we
are
committed
to
full
support
of
all
those
resolute
people
,
everywhere
,
who
are
resisting
aggression
and
are
thereby
keeping
war
away
from
our
hemisphere
.
by
this
support
,
we
express
our
determination
that
the
democratic
cause
shall
prevail
;
and
we
strengthen
the
defense
and
the
security
of
our
own
nation
.
third
,
by
an
impressive
expression
of
the
public
will
and
without
regard
to
partisanship
,
we
are
committed
to
the
proposition
that
principle
of
morality
and
consideration
for
our
own
security
will
never
permit
u
to
acquiesce
in
a
peace
dictated
by
aggressor
and
sponsored
by
appeaser
.
we
know
that
enduring
peace
can
not
be
bought
at
the
cost
of
other
people
's
freedom
.
in
the
recent
national
election
there
wa
no
substantial
difference
between
the
two
great
party
in
respect
to
that
national
policy
.
no
issue
wa
fought
out
on
this
line
before
the
american
electorate
.
today
it
is
abundantly
evident
that
american
citizen
everywhere
are
demanding
and
supporting
speedy
and
complete
action
in
recognition
of
obvious
danger
.
therefore
,
the
immediate
need
is
a
swift
and
driving
increase
in
our
armament
production
.
leader
of
industry
and
labor
have
responded
to
our
summons
.
goal
of
speed
have
been
set
.
in
some
case
these
goal
are
being
reached
ahead
of
time
;
in
some
case
we
are
on
schedule
;
in
other
case
there
are
slight
but
not
serious
delay
;
and
in
some
cases—and
i
am
sorry
to
say
very
important
cases—we
are
all
concerned
by
the
slowness
of
the
accomplishment
of
our
plan
.
the
army
and
navy
,
however
,
have
made
substantial
progress
during
the
past
year
.
actual
experience
is
improving
and
speeding
up
our
method
of
production
with
every
passing
day
.
and
today
's
best
is
not
good
enough
for
tomorrow
.
i
am
not
satisfied
with
the
progress
thus
far
made
.
the
men
in
charge
of
the
program
represent
the
best
in
training
,
in
ability
,
and
in
patriotism
.
they
are
not
satisfied
with
the
progress
thus
far
made
.
none
of
u
will
be
satisfied
until
the
job
is
done
.
no
matter
whether
the
original
goal
wa
set
too
high
or
too
low
,
our
objective
is
quicker
and
better
result
.
to
give
you
two
illustration
:
we
are
behind
schedule
in
turning
out
finished
airplane
;
we
are
working
day
and
night
to
solve
the
innumerable
problem
and
to
catch
up
.
we
are
ahead
of
schedule
in
building
warship
but
we
are
working
to
get
even
further
ahead
of
that
schedule
.
to
change
a
whole
nation
from
a
basis
of
peacetime
production
of
implement
of
peace
to
a
basis
of
wartime
production
of
implement
of
war
is
no
small
task
.
and
the
greatest
difficulty
come
at
the
beginning
of
the
program
,
when
new
tool
,
new
plant
facility
,
new
assembly
line
,
and
new
ship
way
must
first
be
constructed
before
the
actual
materiel
begin
to
flow
steadily
and
speedily
from
them
.
the
congress
,
of
course
,
must
rightly
keep
itself
informed
at
all
time
of
the
progress
of
the
program
.
however
,
there
is
certain
information
,
a
the
congress
itself
will
readily
recognize
,
which
,
in
the
interest
of
our
own
security
and
those
of
the
nation
that
we
are
supporting
,
must
of
need
be
kept
in
confidence
.
new
circumstance
are
constantly
begetting
new
need
for
our
safety
.
i
shall
ask
this
congress
for
greatly
increased
new
appropriation
and
authorization
to
carry
on
what
we
have
begun
.
i
also
ask
this
congress
for
authority
and
for
fund
sufficient
to
manufacture
additional
munition
and
war
supply
of
many
kind
,
to
be
turned
over
to
those
nation
which
are
now
in
actual
war
with
aggressor
nation
.
our
most
useful
and
immediate
role
is
to
act
a
an
arsenal
for
them
a
well
a
for
ourselves
.
they
do
not
need
man
power
,
but
they
do
need
billion
of
dollar
worth
of
the
weapon
of
defense
.
the
time
is
near
when
they
will
not
be
able
to
pay
for
them
all
in
ready
cash
.
we
can
not
,
and
we
will
not
,
tell
them
that
they
must
surrender
,
merely
because
of
present
inability
to
pay
for
the
weapon
which
we
know
they
must
have
.
i
do
not
recommend
that
we
make
them
a
loan
of
dollar
with
which
to
pay
for
these
weapons—a
loan
to
be
repaid
in
dollar
.
i
recommend
that
we
make
it
possible
for
those
nation
to
continue
to
obtain
war
material
in
the
united
state
,
fitting
their
order
into
our
own
program
.
nearly
all
their
materiel
would
,
if
the
time
ever
came
,
be
useful
for
our
own
defense
.
taking
counsel
of
expert
military
and
naval
authority
,
considering
what
is
best
for
our
own
security
,
we
are
free
to
decide
how
much
should
be
kept
here
and
how
much
should
be
sent
abroad
to
our
friend
who
by
their
determined
and
heroic
resistance
are
giving
u
time
in
which
to
make
ready
our
own
defense
.
for
what
we
send
abroad
,
we
shall
be
repaid
within
a
reasonable
time
following
the
close
of
hostility
,
in
similar
material
,
or
,
at
our
option
,
in
other
good
of
many
kind
,
which
they
can
produce
and
which
we
need
.
let
u
say
to
the
democracy
:
``
we
american
are
vitally
concerned
in
your
defense
of
freedom
.
we
are
putting
forth
our
energy
,
our
resource
and
our
organizing
power
to
give
you
the
strength
to
regain
and
maintain
a
free
world
.
we
shall
send
you
,
in
ever-increasing
number
,
ship
,
plane
,
tank
,
gun
.
this
is
our
purpose
and
our
pledge
.
''
in
fulfillment
of
this
purpose
we
will
not
be
intimidated
by
the
threat
of
dictator
that
they
will
regard
a
a
breach
of
international
law
or
a
an
act
of
war
our
aid
to
the
democracy
which
dare
to
resist
their
aggression
.
such
aid
is
not
an
act
of
war
,
even
if
a
dictator
should
unilaterally
proclaim
it
so
to
be
.
when
the
dictator
,
if
the
dictator
,
are
ready
to
make
war
upon
u
,
they
will
not
wait
for
an
act
of
war
on
our
part
.
they
did
not
wait
for
norway
or
belgium
or
the
netherlands
to
commit
an
act
of
war
.
their
only
interest
is
in
a
new
one-way
international
law
,
which
lack
mutuality
in
it
observance
,
and
,
therefore
,
becomes
an
instrument
of
oppression
.
the
happiness
of
future
generation
of
american
may
well
depend
upon
how
effective
and
how
immediate
we
can
make
our
aid
felt
.
no
one
can
tell
the
exact
character
of
the
emergency
situation
that
we
may
be
called
upon
to
meet
.
the
nation
's
hand
must
not
be
tied
when
the
nation
's
life
is
in
danger
.
we
must
all
prepare
to
make
the
sacrifice
that
the
emergency-almost
a
serious
a
war
itself—demands
.
whatever
stand
in
the
way
of
speed
and
efficiency
in
defense
preparation
must
give
way
to
the
national
need
.
a
free
nation
ha
the
right
to
expect
full
cooperation
from
all
group
.
a
free
nation
ha
the
right
to
look
to
the
leader
of
business
,
of
labor
,
and
of
agriculture
to
take
the
lead
in
stimulating
effort
,
not
among
other
group
but
within
their
own
group
.
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
the
few
slacker
or
trouble
maker
in
our
midst
is
,
first
,
to
shame
them
by
patriotic
example
,
and
,
if
that
fails
,
to
use
the
sovereignty
of
government
to
save
government
.
a
men
do
not
live
by
bread
alone
,
they
do
not
fight
by
armament
alone
.
those
who
man
our
defense
,
and
those
behind
them
who
build
our
defense
,
must
have
the
stamen
and
the
courage
which
come
from
unshakable
belief
in
the
manner
of
life
which
they
are
defending
.
the
mighty
action
that
we
are
calling
for
can
not
be
based
on
a
disregard
of
all
thing
worth
fighting
for
.
the
nation
take
great
satisfaction
and
much
strength
from
the
thing
which
have
been
done
to
make
it
people
conscious
of
their
individual
stake
in
the
preservation
of
democratic
life
in
america
.
those
thing
have
toughened
the
fibre
of
our
people
,
have
renewed
their
faith
and
strengthened
their
devotion
to
the
institution
we
make
ready
to
protect
.
certainly
this
is
no
time
for
any
of
u
to
stop
thinking
about
the
social
and
economic
problem
which
are
the
root
cause
of
the
social
revolution
which
is
today
a
supreme
factor
in
the
world
.
for
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
the
foundation
of
a
healthy
and
strong
democracy
.
the
basic
thing
expected
by
our
people
of
their
political
and
economic
system
are
simple
.
they
are
:
equality
of
opportunity
for
youth
and
for
others
.
job
for
those
who
can
work
.
security
for
those
who
need
it
.
the
ending
of
special
privilege
for
the
few
.
the
preservation
of
civil
liberty
for
all
.
the
enjoyment
of
the
fruit
of
scientific
progress
in
a
wider
and
constantly
rising
standard
of
living
.
these
are
the
simple
,
basic
thing
that
must
never
be
lost
sight
of
in
the
turmoil
and
unbelievable
complexity
of
our
modern
world
.
the
inner
and
abiding
strength
of
our
economic
and
political
system
is
dependent
upon
the
degree
to
which
they
fulfill
these
expectation
.
many
subject
connected
with
our
social
economy
call
for
immediate
improvement
.
a
example
:
we
should
bring
more
citizen
under
the
coverage
of
old-age
pension
and
unemployment
insurance
.
we
should
widen
the
opportunity
for
adequate
medical
care
.
we
should
plan
a
better
system
by
which
person
deserving
or
needing
gainful
employment
may
obtain
it
.
i
have
called
for
personal
sacrifice
.
i
am
assured
of
the
willingness
of
almost
all
american
to
respond
to
that
call
.
a
part
of
the
sacrifice
mean
the
payment
of
more
money
in
tax
.
in
my
budget
message
i
shall
recommend
that
a
greater
portion
of
this
great
defense
program
be
paid
for
from
taxation
than
we
are
paying
today
.
no
person
should
try
,
or
be
allowed
,
to
get
rich
out
of
this
program
;
and
the
principle
of
tax
payment
in
accordance
with
ability
to
pay
should
be
constantly
before
our
eye
to
guide
our
legislation
.
if
the
congress
maintains
these
principle
,
the
voter
,
putting
patriotism
ahead
of
pocketbook
,
will
give
you
their
applause
.
in
the
future
day
,
which
we
seek
to
make
secure
,
we
look
forward
to
a
world
founded
upon
four
essential
human
freedom
.
the
first
is
freedom
of
speech
and
expression—everywhere
in
the
world
.
the
second
is
freedom
of
every
person
to
worship
god
in
his
own
way—everywhere
in
the
world
.
the
third
is
freedom
from
want—which
,
translated
into
world
term
,
mean
economic
understanding
which
will
secure
to
every
nation
a
healthy
peacetime
life
for
it
inhabitants-everywhere
in
the
world
.
the
fourth
is
freedom
from
fear—which
,
translated
into
world
term
,
mean
a
world-wide
reduction
of
armament
to
such
a
point
and
in
such
a
thorough
fashion
that
no
nation
will
be
in
a
position
to
commit
an
act
of
physical
aggression
against
any
neighbor—anywhere
in
the
world
.
that
is
no
vision
of
a
distant
millennium
.
it
is
a
definite
basis
for
a
kind
of
world
attainable
in
our
own
time
and
generation
.
that
kind
of
world
is
the
very
antithesis
of
the
so-called
new
order
of
tyranny
which
the
dictator
seek
to
create
with
the
crash
of
a
bomb
.
to
that
new
order
we
oppose
the
greater
conception—the
moral
order
.
a
good
society
is
able
to
face
scheme
of
world
domination
and
foreign
revolution
alike
without
fear
.
since
the
beginning
of
our
american
history
,
we
have
been
engaged
in
change—in
a
perpetual
peaceful
revolution—a
revolution
which
go
on
steadily
,
quietly
adjusting
itself
to
changing
conditions—without
the
concentration
camp
or
the
quick-lime
in
the
ditch
.
the
world
order
which
we
seek
is
the
cooperation
of
free
country
,
working
together
in
a
friendly
,
civilized
society
.
this
nation
ha
placed
it
destiny
in
the
hand
and
head
and
heart
of
it
million
of
free
men
and
woman
;
and
it
faith
in
freedom
under
the
guidance
of
god
.
freedom
mean
the
supremacy
of
human
right
everywhere
.
our
support
go
to
those
who
struggle
to
gain
those
right
or
keep
them
.
our
strength
is
our
unity
of
purpose
.
to
that
high
concept
there
can
be
no
end
save
victory
.
