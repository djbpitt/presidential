fellow-citizens

:
again
the
blessing
of
health
and
abundant
harvest
claim
our
proroundest
gratitude
to
almighty
god
.
the
condition
of
our
foreign
affair
is
reasonably
satisfactory
.
mexico
continues
to
be
a
theater
of
civil
war
.
while
our
political
relation
with
that
country
have
undergone
no
change
,
we
have
at
the
same
time
strictly
maintained
neutrality
between
the
belligerent
.
at
the
request
of
the
state
of
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
,
a
competent
engineer
ha
been
authorized
to
make
a
survey
of
the
river
san
juan
and
the
port
of
san
juan
.
it
is
a
source
of
much
satisfaction
that
the
difficulty
which
for
a
moment
excited
some
political
apprehension
and
caused
a
closing
of
the
interoceanic
transit
route
have
been
amicably
adjusted
,
and
that
there
is
a
good
prospect
that
the
route
will
soon
be
reopened
with
an
increase
of
capacity
and
adaptation
.
we
could
not
exaggerate
either
the
commercial
or
the
political
importance
of
that
great
improvement
.
it
would
be
doing
injustice
to
an
important
south
american
state
not
to
acknowledge
the
directness
,
frankness
,
and
cordiality
with
which
the
united
state
of
colombia
have
entered
into
intimate
relation
with
this
government
.
a
claim
convention
ha
been
constituted
to
complete
the
unfinished
work
of
the
one
which
closed
it

in
1861
.
the
new
liberal
constitution
of
venezuela
having
gone
into
effect
with
the
universal
acquiescence
of
the
people
,
the
government
under
it
ha
been
recognized
and
diplomatic
intercourse
with
it
ha
opened
in
a
cordial
and
friendly
spirit
.
the
long-deferred
aves
island
claim
ha
been
satisfactorily
paid
and
discharged
.
mutual
payment
have
been
made
of
the
claim
awarded
by
the
late
joint
commission
for
the
settlement
of
claim
between
the
united
state
and
peru
.
an
earnest
and
cordial
friendship
continues
to
exist
between
the
two
country
,
and
such
effort
a
were
in
my
power
have
been
used
to
remove
misunderstanding
and
avert
a
threatened
war
between
peru
and
spain
.
our
relation
are
of
the
most
friendly
nature
with
chile
,
the
argentine
republic
,
bolivia
,
costa
rica
,
paraguay
,
san

,
and

during
the
past
year
no
difference
of
any
kind
have
arisen
with
any
of
those

,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
their
sympathy
with
the

are
constantly
expressed
with
cordiality
and
earnestness
.
the
claim
arising
from
the
seizure
of
the
cargo
of
the
brig
macedonian
in
1821
ha
been
paid
in
full
by
the
government
of

civil
war
continues
in
the
spanish
part
of
san
domingo
,
apparently
without
prospect
of
an
early
close
.
official
correspondence
ha
been
freely
opened
with
liberia
,
and
it
give
u
a
pleasing
view
of
social
and
political
progress
in
that
republic
.
it
may
be
expected
to
derive
new
vigor
from
american
influence
,
improved
by
the
rapid
disappearance
of
slavery
in
the
united
state
.
i
solicit
your
authority
to
furnish
to
the
republic
a
gunboat
at
moderate
cost
,
to
be
reimbursed
to
the
united
state
by
installment
.
such
a
vessel
is
needed
for
the
safety
of
that
state
against
the
native
african
race
,
and
in
liberian
hand
it
would
be
more
effective
in
arresting
the
african
slave
trade
than
a
squadron
in
our
own
hand
.
the
possession
of
the
least
organized
naval
force
would
stimulate
a
generous
ambition
in
the
republic
,
and
the
confidence
which
we
should
manifest
by
furnishing
it
would
win
forbearance
and
favor
toward
the
colony
from
all
civilized
nation
.
the
proposed
overland
telegraph
between

by

way
of
behring
strait
and
asiatic

,
which
wa
sanctioned
by
congress
at
the
last
session
,
ha
been
undertaken
,
under
very
favorable
circumstance
,
by
an
association
of
american
citizen
,
with
the
cordial
good
will
and
support
a
well
of
this
government
a
of
those
of
great
britain
and
russia
.
assurance
have
been
received
from
most
of
the
south
american
state
of
their
high
appreciation
of
the
enterprise
and
their
readiness
to
cooperate
in
constructing
line
tributary
to
that
world-encircling
communication
.
i
learn
with
much
satisfaction
that
the
noble
design
of
a
telegraphic
communication
between
the
eastern
coast
of
america
and
great
britain
ha
been
renewed
,
with
full
expectation
of
it
early
accomplishment
.
thus
it
is
hoped
that
with
the
return
of
domestic
peace
the
country
will
be
able
to
resume
with
energy
and
advantage
it
former
high
career
of
commerce
and
civilization
.
our
very
popular
and
estimable
representative
in
egypt
died
in
april
last
.
an
unpleasant
altercation
which
arose
between
the
temporary
incumbent
of
the
office
and
the
government
of
the
pasha
resulted
in
a
suspension
of
intercourse
.
the
evil
wa
promptly
corrected
on
the
arrival
of
the
successor
in
the
consulate
,
and
our
relation
with
egypt
,
a
well
a
our
relation
with
the
barbary
power
,
are
entirely
satisfactory
.
the
rebellion
which
ha
so
long
been
flagrant
in
china
ha
at
last
been
suppressed
,
with
the
cooperating
good
office
of
this
government
and
of
the
other
western
commercial
state
.
the
judicial
consular
establishment
there
ha
become
very
difficult
and
onerous
,
and
it
will
need
legislative
revision
to
adapt
it
to
the
extension
of
our
commerce
and
to
the
more
intimate
intercourse
which
ha
been
instituted
with
the
government
and
people
of
that
vast
empire
.
china
seems
to
be
accepting
with
hearty
good
will
the
conventional
law
which
regulate
commercial
and
social
intercourse
among
the
western
nation
.
owing
to
the
peculiar
situation
of
japan
and
the
anomalous
form
of
it
government
,
the
action
of
that
empire
in
performing
treaty
stipulation
is
inconstant
and
capricious
.
nevertheless
,
good
progress
ha
been
effected
by
the
western
power
,
moving
with
enlightened
concert
.
our
own
pecuniary
claim
have
been
allowed
or
put
in
course
of
settlement
,
and
the
inland
sea
ha
been
reopened
to
commerce
.
there
is
reason
also
to
believe
that
these
proceeding
have
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
friendship
of
japan
toward
the
united
state
.
the
port
of
norfolk
,
fernandina
,
and
pensacola
have
been
opened
by
proclamation
.
it
is
hoped
that
foreign
merchant
will
now
consider
whether
it
is
not
safer
and
more
profitable
to
themselves
,
a
well
a
just
to
the
united
state
,
to
resort
to
these
and
other
open
port
than
it
is
to
pursue
,
through
many
hazard
and
at
vast
cost
,
a
contraband
trade
with
other
port
which
are
closed
,
if
not
by
actual
military
occupation
,
at
least
by
a
lawful
and
effective
blockade
.
for
myself
,
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
power
and
duty
of
the
executive
,
under
the
law
of
nation
,
to
exclude
enemy
of
the
human
race
from
an
asylum
in
the
united
state
.
if
congress
should
think
that
proceeding
in
such
case
lack
the
authority
of
law
,
or
ought
to
be
further
regulated
by
it
,
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
effectually
preventing
foreign
slave
trader
from
acquiring
domicile
and
facility
for
their
criminal
occupation
in
our
country
.
it
is
possible
that
if
it
were
new
and
open
question
the
maritime
power
,
with
the
light
they
now
enjoy
,
would
not
concede
the
privilege
of
a
naval
belligerent
to
the
insurgent
of
the
united
state
,
destitute

have
been
neither
le
assiduous
nor
more
successful
during
the
last
year
than
they
were
before
that
time
in
their
effort
under
favor
of
that
privilege
,
to
embroil
our
country
in
foreign
war
.
the
desire
and
determination
of
the
government
of
the
maritime
state
to
defeat
that
design
are
believed
to
be
a
sincere
a
and
can
not
be
more
earnest
than
our
own
.
nevertheless
,
unforeseen
political
difficulty
have
arisen
,
especially
in
brazilian
and
british
port
and
on
the
northern
boundary
of
the
united
state
,
which
have
required
,
and
are
likely
to
continue
to
require
,
the
practice
of
constant
vigilance
and
a
just
and
conciliatory
spirit
on
the
part
of
the
united

in

,
and

now

to
them
.
in
view
of
the
insecurity
of
life
and
property
in
the
region
adjacent
to
the
canadian
border
,
by
reason
of
recent
assault
and
depredation
committed
by
inimical
and
desperate
person
who
are
harbored
there
,
it
ha
been
thought
proper
to
give
notice
that
after
the
expiration
of
six
month
,
the
period
conditionally
stipulated
in
the
existing
arrangement
with
great
britain
,
the
united
state
must
hold
themselves
at
liberty
to
increase
their
naval
armament
upon
the
lake
if
they
shall
find
that
proceeding
necessary
.
the
condition
of
the
border
will
necessarily
come
into
consideration
in
connection
with
the
question
of
continuing
or
modifying
the
right
of
transit
from
canada
through
the
united
state
,

the
regulation
of
impost
,
which
were
temporarily
established
by
the
reciprocity
treaty
of
the
5th
june
,
1854
.
i
desire
,
however
,
to
be
understood
while
making
this
statement
that
the
colonial
authority
of
canada
are
not
deemed
to
be
intentionally
unjust
or
unfriendly
toward
the
united
state
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
that
,
with
the
approval
of
the
imperial
government
,
they
will
take
the
necessary
measure
to
prevent
new
incursion
across
the
border
.
the
act
passed
at
the
last
session
for
the
encouragement
of
immigration
ha
so
far
a
wa
possible
been
put
into
operation
.
it
seems
to
need
amendment
which
will
enable
the
officer
of
the
government
to
prevent
the
practice
of
fraud
against
the
immigrant
while
on
their
way
and
on
their
arrival
in
the
port
,
so
a
to
secure
them
here
a
free
choice
of
avocation
and
place
of
settlement
.
a
liberal
disposition
toward
this
great
national
policy
is
manifested
by
most
of
the
european
state
,
and
ought
to
be
reciprocated
on
our
part
by
giving
the
immigrant
effective
national
protection
.
i
regard
our
immigrant
a
one
of
the
principal
replenishing
stream
which
are
appointed
by
providence
to
repair
the
ravage
of
internal
war
and
it
waste
of
national
strength
and
health
.
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
secure
the
flow
of
that
stream
in
it
present
fullness
,
and
to
that
end
the
government
must
in
every
way
make
it
manifest
that
it
neither
need
nor
design
to
impose
involuntary
military
service
upon
those
who
come
from
other
land
to
cast
their
lot
in
our
country

i
refer
you
to
the
report

i
concur
with
him
in
the
opinion
that
the
proportion

money
required
to
meet
the
expense
consequent
upon
the
war
derived
from
taxation
should
be
still
further
increased
;

i
earnestly
invite
your
attention
to
this
subject

to
the
end
that
there
may
be

shall
be

last
,
a
appears
by
the
book

amounted
to
$
1,740,690,489.49

probably
,

continue

that
amount
may
be
increased

not

from

,
a
it
is
,
for
the
most
part
by
our
own
people
,
it
ha
become
a
substantial
branch
of
national
,
though
private
,
property
.
for
obvious
reason
the
more
nearly
this
property
can
be
distributed
among
all
the
people
the
better
.
to
favor
such
general
distribution
,
greater
inducement
to
become
owner
might
,
perhaps
,
with
good
effect
and
without
injury
be
presented
to
person
of
limited
mean
.
with
this
view
i
suggest
whether
it
might
not
be
both
competent
and
expedient
for
congress
to
provide
that
a
limited
amount
of
some
future
issue
of
public
security
might
be
held
by
any
bona
fide
purchaser
exempt
from
taxation
and
from
seizure
for
debt
,
under
such
restriction
and
limitation
a
might
be
necessary
to
guard
against
abuse
of
so
important
a
privilege
.
this
would
enable
every
prudent
person
to
set
aside
a
small
annuity
against
a
possible
day
of
want
.
privilege
like
these
would
render
the
possession
of
such
security
to
the
amount
limited
most
desirable
to
every
person
of
small
mean
who
might
be
able
to
save
enough
for
the
purpose
.
the
great
advantage
of
citizen
being
creditor
a
well
a
debtor
with
relation
to
the
public
debt
is
obvious
.
men
readily
perceive
that
they
can
not
be
much
oppressed
by
a
debt
which
they
owe
to
themselves

the
public
debt

the

although
somewhat
exceeding
the
estimate
of
the
secretary
of

at

short
of
the
estimate

this
fact
exhibit
a
satisfactory
condition
and
conduct
of
the
operation
of
the
treasury
.
the
national
banking
system
is
proving
to
be
acceptable
to
capitalist
and
to
the
people
.
on
the
25th
day
of
november
584
national
bank
had
been
organized
,
a
considerable
number
of

were

from

bank
.
change
from
state
system
to
the
national
system
are
rapidly
taking
place
,
and
it
is
hoped
that
very
soon
there
will
be
in
the
united
state
no
bank
of
issue
not
authorized
by
congress
and
no
bank-note
circulation
not
secured
by
the
government
.
that
the
government
and
the
people
will
derive
great
benefit
from
this
change
in
the
banking
system
of
the
country
can
hardly
be
questioned
.
the
national
system
will
create
a
reliable
and
permanent
influence
in
support
of
the
national
credit
and
protect
the
people
against
loss
in
the
use
of
paper
money
.
whether
or
not
any
further
legislation
is
advisable
for
the
suppression
of
state-bank
issue
it
will
be
for
congress
to
determine
.
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
treasury
can
not
be
satisfactorily
conducted
unless
the
government
can
exercise
a
restraining
power
over
the
bank-note
circulation
of
the
country

it

a

congratulation

laudable
pride
to
our

the
recommendation

to
the
propriety

in

your

is
invited
to
the
report
of
the
postmaster-general
for
a
detailed
account
of
the
operation
and
financial
condition
of
the
post-office
department

the
postal
revenue
for

the
view
presented
by
the
postmaster-general
on
the
subject
of
special
grant
by
the
government
in
aid
of
the
establishment
of
new
line
of
ocean
mail
steamship
and
the
policy
he
recommends
for
the
development
of
increased
commercial
intercourse
with
adjacent
and
neighboring
country
should
receive
the
careful
consideration
of
congress
.
it
is
of
noteworthy
interest
that
the
steady
expansion
of
population
,
improvement
,
and
governmental
institution
over
the
new
and
unoccupied
portion
of
our
country
have
scarcely
been
checked
,
much
le
impeded
or
destroyed
,
by
our
great
civil
war
,
which
at
first
glance
would
seem
to
have
absorbed
almost
the
entire
energy
of
the
nation
.
the
organization
and
admission
of
the
state
of
nevada
ha
been
completed
in
conformity
with
law
,
and
thus
our
excellent
system
is
firmly
established
in
the
mountain
,
which
once
seemed
a
barren
and
uninhabitable
waste
between
the
atlantic
state
and
those
which
have
grown
up
on
the
coast
of
the
pacific
ocean
.
the
territory
of
the

generally
in
a
condition
of

growth

idaho
and
montana
,
by
reason
of
their
great
distance
and
the
interruption
of
communication
with
them
by
indian
hostility
,
have
been
only
partially
organized
;
but
it
is
understood
that
these
difficulty
are
about
to
disappear
,
which
will
permit
their
government
,
like
those
of
the
others
,
to
go
into
speedy
and
full
operation

there
is
open
to

the
great
enterprise
of
connecting

pacific
state
by
railway
and

line
ha
been
entered
upon
with
a
vigor
that

last
session

acting
upon
the
recommendation
,
did
provide
for
reorganizing

it

believed
that
under

organization
the
management

his
recommendation

attention

i
cheerfully
commend
to
your

the
benevolent
institution

and
other
matter
of
local
interest
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
.
the
agricultural
department
,
under
the
supervision
of
it
present
energetic
and
faithful
head
,
is
rapidly
commending
itself
to
the
great
and
vital
interest
it
wa
created
to
advance
it
is
peculiarly
the
people
's
department
,
in
which
they
feel
more
directly
concerned
than
in
any
other
.
i
commend
it
to
the
continued
attention
and
fostering
care
of
congress
.
the
war
continues
.
since
the
last
annual
message
all
the
important
line
and
position
then
occupied
by
our
force
have
been
maintained
and
our
arm
have
steadily
advanced
,
thus
liberating
the
region
left
in
rear
,
so
that
missouri
,
kentucky
,
tennessee
,
and
part
of
other
state
have
again
produced
reasonably
fair
crop
.
the
most
remarkable
feature
in
the
military
operation
of
the
year
is
general
sherman's
attempted
march
of
300
mile
directly
through
the
insurgent
region
.
it
tends
to
show
a
great
increase
of
our
relative
strength
that
our
general
in
chief
should
feel
able
to
confront
and
hold
in
check
every
active
force
of
the
enemy
,
and
yet
to
detach
a
well-appointed
large
army
to
move
on
such
an
expedition
.
the
result
not
yet
being
known
,
conjecture
in
regard
to
it
is
not
here
indulged
.
important
movement
have
also
occurred
during
the
year
to
the
effect
of
molding
society
for
durability
in
the
union
.
although
short
of
complete
success
,
it
is
much
in
the
fight
direction
that
12,000
citizen
in
each
of
the
state
of
arkansas
and
louisiana
have
organized
loyal
state
government
,
with
free
constitution
,
and
are
earnestly
struggling
to
maintain
and
administer
them
.
the
movement
in
the
same
direction
,
more
extensive
though
le
definite
,
in
missouri
,
kentucky
,
and
tennessee
should
not
be
overlooked
.
but
maryland
present
the
example
of
complete
success
.
maryland
is
secure
to
liberty
and
union
for
all
the
future
.
the
genius
of
rebellion
will
no
more
claim
maryland
.
like
another
foul
spirit
being
driven
out
,
it
may
seek
to
tear
her
,
but
it
will
woo
her
no-more
.
at
the
last
session
of
congress
a
proposed
amendment
of
the
constitution
abolishing
slavery
throughout
the
united
state
passed
the
senate
,
but
failed
for
lack
of
the
requisite
two-thirds
vote
in
the
house
of
representative
.
although
the
present
is
the
same
congress
and
nearly
the
same
member
,
and
without
questioning
the
wisdom
or
patriotism
of
those
who
stood
in
opposition
,
i
venture
to
recommend
the
reconsideration
and
passage
of
the
measure
at
the
present
session
.
of
course
the
abstract
question
is
not
changed
;
but
in
intervening
election
show
almost
certainly
that
the
next
congress
will
pas
the
measure
if
this
doe
not
.
hence
there
is
only
a
question
of
time
a
to
when
the
proposed
amendment
will
go
to
the
state
for
their
action
.
and
a
it
is
to
so
go
at
all
event
,
may
we
not
agree
that
the
sooner
the
better
?
it
is
not
claimed
that
the
election
ha
imposed
a
duty
on
member
to
change
their
view
or
their
vote
any
further
than
,
a
an
additional
element
to
be
considered
,
their
judgment
may
be
affected
by
it
.
it
is
the
voice
of
the
people
now
for
the
first
time
heard
upon
the
question
.
in
a
great
national
crisis
like
ours
unanimity
of
action
among
those
seeking
a
common
end
is
very
desirable
--
almost
indispensable
.
and
yet
no
approach
to
such
unanimity
is
attainable
unless
some
deference
shall
be
paid
to
the
will
of
the
majority
simply
because
it
is
the
will
of
the
majority
.
in
this
case
the
common
end
is
the
maintenance
of
the
union
,
and
among
the
mean
to
secure
that
end
such
will
,
through
the
election
,
is
most
dearly
declared
in
favor
of
such
constitutional
amendment
.
the
most
reliable
indication
of
public
purpose
in
this
country
is
derived
through
our
popular
election
.
judging
by
the
recent
canvas
and
it
result
,
the
purpose
of
the
people
within
the
loyal
state
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
union
wa
never
more
firm
nor
more
nearly
unanimous
than
now
.
the
extraordinary
calmness
and
good
order
with
which
the
million
of
voter
met
and
mingled
at
the
poll
give
strong
assurance
of
this
.
not
only
all
those
who
supported
the
union
ticket
,
so
called
,
but
a
great
majority
of
the
opposing
party
also
may
be
fairly
claimed
to
entertain
and
to
be
actuated
by
the
same
purpose
.
it
is
an
unanswerable
argument
to
this
effect
that
no
candidate
for
any
officce
whatever
,
high
or
low
,
ha
ventured
to
seek
vote
on
the
avowal
that
he
wa
for
giving
up
the
union
.
there
have
been
much
impugning
of
motif
and
much
heated
controversy
a
to
the
proper
mean
and
best
mode
of
advancing
the
union
cause
,
but
on
the
distinct
issue
of
union
or
no
union
the
politician
have
shown
their
instinctive
knowledge
that
there
is
no
diversity
among
the
people
.
in
affording
the
people
the
fair
opportunity
of
showing
one
to
another
and
to
the
world
this
firmess
and
unanimity
of
purpose
,
the
election
ha
been
of
vast
value
to
the
national
cause
.
the
election
ha
exhibited
another
tact
not
le
valuable
to
be
known
--
the
fact
that
we
do
not
approach
exhaustion
in
the
most
important
branch
of
national
resource
,
that
of
living
men
.
while
it
is
melancholy
to
reflect
that
the
war
ha
filled
so
many
graf
and
carried
mourning
to
so
many
heart
,
it
is
some
relief
to
know
that
,
compared
with
the
surviving
,
the
fallen
have
been
so
few
.
while
corp
and
division
and
brigade
and
regiment
have
formed
and
fought
and
dwindled
and
gone
out
of
existence
,
a
great
majority
of
the
men
who
composed
them
are
still
living
.
the
same
is
true
of
the
naval
service
.
the
election
return
prove
this

so
many

could
not
else

to
this
is
to
be
added
33,762
cast
now
in
the
new
state
of

and

,
which
state
did

thus
swelling
the
aggregate
to
4,015,773
and
the
net
increase
during
the
three
year
and
a
half
of
war
to
145,551
.
a
table
is
appended
showing
particular
.
to
this
again
should
be
added
the
number
of
all

in
the
field
from
massachusetts
,
rhode
island
,
new

,
delaware
,
indiana
,

,
and
california
,
who
by
the
law
of
those
state
could
not
vote
away
from
their
home
,
and
which
number
can
not
be
le
than
90,000
.
nor
yet
is
this
all
.
the
number
in
organized
territory
is
triple
now
what
it
wa
four
year
ago
,
while
thousand
,
white
and
black
,
join
u
a
the
national
arm
press
back
the
insurgent
line
.
so
much
is
shown
,
affirmatively
and
negatively
,
by
the
election
.
it
is
not
material
to
inquire
how
the
increase
ha
been
produced
or
to
show
that
it
would
have
been
greater
but
for
the
war
,
which
is
probably
true
.
the
important
fact
remains
demonstrated
that
we
have
more
men
now
than
we
had
when
the
war
began
;
that
we
are
not
exhausted
nor
in
process
of
exhaustion
;
that
we
are
gaining
strength
and
may
if
need
be
maintain
the
contest
indefinitely
.
this
a
to
men
.
material
resource
are
now
more
complete
and
abundant
than
ever
.
the
national
resource
,
then
,
are
unexhausted
,
and
,
a
we
believe
,
inexhaustible
.
the
public
purpose
to
reestablish
and
maintain
the
national
authority
is
unchanged
,
and
,
a
we
believe
,
unchangeable
.
the
manner
of
continuing
the
effort
remains
to
choose
.
on
careful
consideration
of
all
the
evidence
accessible
it
seems
to
me
that
no
attempt
at
negotiation
with
the
insurgent
leader
could
result
in
any
good
.
he
would
accept
nothing
short
of
severance
of
the
union
,
precisely
what
we
will
not
and
can
not
give
.
his
declaration
to
this
effect
are
explicit
and
oft
repeated
.
he
doe
not
attempt
to
deceive
u
.
he
affords
u
no
excuse
to
deceive
ourselves
.
he
can
not
voluntarily
reaccept
the
union
;
we
can
not
voluntarily
yield
it
.
between
him
and
u
the
issue
is
distinct
,
simple
,
and
inflexible
.
it
is
an
issue
which
can
only
be
tried
by
war
and
decided
by
victory
.
if
we
yield
,
we
are
beaten
;
if
the
southern
people
fail
him
,
he
is
beaten
.
either
way
it
would
be
the
victory
and
defeat
following
war
.
what
is
true
,
however
,
of
him
who
head
the
insurgent
cause
is
not
necessarily
true
of
those
who
follow
.
although
he
can
not
reaccept
the
union
,
they
can
.
some
of
them
,
we
know
,
already
desire
peace
and
reunion
.
the
number
of
such
may
increase
.
they
can
at
any
moment
have
peace
simply
by
laying
down
their
arm
and
submitting
to
the
national
authority
under
the
constitution
.
alter
so
much
the
government
could
not
,
if
it
would
,
maintain
war
against
them
.
the
loyal
people
would
not
sustain
or
allow
it
.
if
question
should
remain
,
we
would
adjust
them
by
the
peaceful
mean
of
legislation
,
conference
,
court
,
and
vote
,
operating
only
in
constitutional
and
lawful
channel
.
some
certain
,
and
other
possible
,
question
are
and
would
be
beyond
the
executive
power
to
adjust
;
a
,
for
instance
,
the
admission
of
member
into
congress
and
whatever
might
require
the
appropriation
of
money
.
the
executive
power
itself
would
be
greatly
diminished
by
the
cessation
of
actual
war
.
pardon
and
remission
of
forfeiture
,
however
,
would
still
be
within
executive
control
.
in
what
spirit
and
temper
this
control
would
be
exercised
can
be
fairly
judged
of
by
the
past
.
a
year
ago
general
pardon
and
amnesty
,
upon
specified
term
,
were
offered
to
all
except
certain
designated
class
,
and
it
wa
at
the
same
time
made
known
that
the
excepted
class
were
still
within
contemplation
of
special
clemency
.
during
the
year
many
availed
themselves
of
the
general
provision
,
and
many
more
would
,
only
that
the
sign
of
bad
faith
in
some
led
to
such
precautionary
measure
a
rendered
the
practical
process
le
easy
and
certain
.
during
the
same
time
also
special
pardon
have
been
granted
to
individual
of
the
excepted
class
,
and
no
voluntary
application
ha
been
denied
.
thus
practically
the
door
ha
been
for
a
full
year
open
to
all
except
such
a
were
not
in
condition
to
make
free
choice
;
that
is
,
such
a
were
in
custody
or
under
constraint
.
it
is
still
so
open
to
all
.
but
the
time
may
come
,
probably
will
come
,
when
public
duty
shall
demand
that
it
be
closed
and
that
in
lieu
more
rigorous
measure
than
heretofore
shall
be
adopted
.
in
presenting
the
abandonment
of
armed
resistance
to
the
national
authority
on
the
part
of
the
insurgent
a
the
only
indispensable
condition
to
ending
the
war
on
the
part
of
the
government
,
i
retract
nothing
heretofore
said
a
to
slavery
.
i
repeat
the
declaration
made
a
year
a
ago
,
that
``
while
i
remain
in
my
present
position
i
shall
not
attempt
to
retract
or
modify
the
emancipation
proclamation
,
nor
shall
i
return
to
slavery
any
person
who
is
free
by
the
term
of
that
proclamation
or
by
any
of
the
act
of
congress
.
''
if
the
people
should
,
by
whatever
mode
or
mean
,
make
it
an
executive
duty
to
reenslave
such
person
,
another
,
and
not
i
,
must
be
their
instrument
to
perform
it
.
in
stating
a
single
condition
of
peace
i
mean
simply
to
say
that
the
war
will
cease
on
the
part
of
the
government
whenever
it
shall
have
ceased
on
the
part
of
those
who
began
it
.
