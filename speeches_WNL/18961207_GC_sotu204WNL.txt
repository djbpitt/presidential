to
the
congress
of
the
united
state
:
a
representative
of
the
people
in
the
legislative
branch
of
their
government
,
you
have
assembled
at
a
time
when
the
strength
and
excellence
of
our
free
institution
and
the
fitness
of
our
citizen
to
enjoy
popular
rule
have
been
again
made
manifest
.
a
political
contest
involving
momentous
consequence
,
fraught
with
feverish
apprehension
,
and
creating
aggressiveness
so
intense
a
to
approach
bitterness
and
passion
ha
been
waged
throughout
our
land
and
determined
by
the
decree
of
free
and
independent
suffrage
without
disturbance
of
our
tranquillity
or
the
least
sign
of
weakness
in
our
national
structure
.
when
we
consider
these
incident
and
contemplate
the
peaceful
obedience
and
manly
submission
which
have
succeeded
a
heated
clash
of
political
opinion
,
we
discover
abundant
evidence
of
a
determination
on
the
part
of
our
countryman
to
abide
by
every
verdict
of
the
popular
will
and
to
be
controlled
at
all
time
by
an
abiding
faith
in
the
agency
established
for
the
direction
of
the
affair
of
their
government
.
thus
our
people
exhibit
a
patriotic
disposition
which
entitles
them
to
demand
of
those
who
undertake
to
make
and
execute
their
law
such
faithful
and
unselfish
service
in
their
behalf
a
can
only
be
prompted
by
a
serious
appreciation
of
the
trust
and
confidence
which
the
acceptance
of
public
duty
invite
.
in
obedience
to
a
constitutional
requirement
i
herein
submit
to
the
congress
certain
information
concerning
national
affair
,
with
the
suggestion
of
such
legislation
a
in
my
judgment
is
necessary
and
expedient
.
to
secure
brevity
and
avoid
tiresome
narration
i
shall
omit
many
detail
concerning
matter
within
federal
control
which
,
though
by
no
mean
unimportant
,
are
more
profitably
discussed
in
departmental
report
.
i
shall
also
further
curtail
this
communication
by
omitting
a
minute
recital
of
many
minor
incident
connected
with
our
foreign
relation
which
have
heretofore
found
a
place
in
executive
message
,
but
are
now
contained
in
a
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
,
which
is
herewith
submitted
.
at
the
outset
of
a
reference
to
the
more
important
matter
affecting
our
relation
with
foreign
power
it
would
afford
me
satisfaction
if
i
could
assure
the
congress
that
the
disturbed
condition
in
asiatic
turkey
had
during
the
past
year
assumed
a
le
hideous
and
bloody
aspect
and
that
,
either
a
a
consequence
of
the
awakening
of
the
turkish
government
to
the
demand
of
humane
civilization
or
a
the
result
of
decisive
action
on
the
part
of
the
great
nation
having
the
right
by
treaty
to
interfere
for
the
protection
of
those
exposed
to
the
rage
of
mad
bigotry
and
cruel
fanaticism
,
the
shocking
feature
of
the
situation
had
been
mitigated
.
instead
,
however
,
of
welcoming
a
softened
disposition
or
protective
intervention
,
we
have
been
afflicted
by
continued
and
not
unfrequent
report
of
the
wanton
destruction
of
home
and
the
bloody
butchery
of
men
,
woman
,
and
child
,
made
martyr
to
their
profession
of
christian
faith
.
while
none
of
our
citizen
in
turkey
have
thus
far
been
killed
or
wounded
,
though
often
in
the
midst
of
dreadful
scene
of
danger
,
their
safety
in
the
future
is
by
no
mean
assured
.
our
government
at
home
and
our
minister
at
constantinople
have
left
nothing
undone
to
protect
our
missionary
in
ottoman
territory
,
who
constitute
nearly
all
the
individual
residing
there
who
have
a
right
to
claim
our
protection
on
the
score
of
american
citizenship
.
our
effort
in
this
direction
will
not
be
relaxed
;
but
the
deep
feeling
and
sympathy
that
have
been
aroused
among
our
people
ought
not
to
so
far
blind
their
reason
and
judgment
a
to
lead
them
to
demand
impossible
thing
.
the
outbreak
of
the
blind
fury
which
lead
to
murder
and
pillage
in
turkey
occur
suddenly
and
without
notice
,
and
an
attempt
on
our
part
to
force
such
a
hostile
presence
there
a
might
be
effective
for
prevention
or
protection
would
not
only
be
resisted
by
the
ottoman
government
,
but
would
be
regarded
a
an
interruption
of
their
plan
by
the
great
nation
who
assert
their
exclusive
right
to
intervene
in
their
own
time
and
method
for
the
security
of
life
and
property
in
turkey
.
several
naval
vessel
are
stationed
in
the
mediterranean
a
a
measure
of
caution
and
to
furnish
all
possible
relief
and
refuge
in
case
of
emergency
.
we
have
made
claim
against
the
turkish
government
for
the
pillage
and
destruction
of
missionary
property
at
harpoot
and
marash
during
uprising
at
those
place
.
thus
far
the
validity
of
these
demand
ha
not
been
admitted
,
though
our
minister
,
prior
to
such
outrage
and
in
anticipation
of
danger
,
demanded
protection
for
the
person
and
property
of
our
missionary
citizen
in
the
locality
mentioned
and
notwithstanding
that
strong
evidence
exists
of
actual
complicity
of
turkish
soldier
in
the
work
of
destruction
and
robbery
.
the
fact
a
they
now
appear
do
not
permit
u
to
doubt
the
justice
of
these
claim
,
and
nothing
will
be
omitted
to
bring
about
their
prompt
settlement
.
a
number
of
armenian
refugee
having
arrived
at
our
port
,
an
order
ha
lately
been
obtained
from
the
turkish
government
permitting
the
wife
and
child
of
such
refugee
to
join
them
here
.
it
is
hoped
that
hereafter
no
obstacle
will
be
interposed
to
prevent
the
escape
of
all
those
who
seek
to
avoid
the
peril
which
threaten
them
in
turkish
dominion
.
our
recently
appointed
consul
to
erzerum
is
at
his
post
and
discharging
the
duty
of
his
office
,
though
for
some
unaccountable
reason
his
formal
exequatur
from
the
sultan
ha
not
been
issued
.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
present
somber
prospect
in
turkey
will
be
long
permitted
to
offend
the
sight
of
christendom
.
it
so
mar
the
humane
and
enlightened
civilization
that
belongs
to
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
it
seems
hardly
possible
that
the
earnest
demand
of
good
people
throughout
the
christian
world
for
it
corrective
treatment
will
remain
unanswered
.
the
insurrection
in
cuba
still
continues
with
all
it
perplexity
.
it
is
difficult
to
perceive
that
any
progress
ha
thus
far
been
made
toward
the
pacification
of
the
island
or
that
the
situation
of
affair
a
depicted
in
my
last
annual
message
ha
in
the
least
improved
.
if
spain
still
hold
havana
and
the
seaport
and
all
the
considerable
town
,
the
insurgent
still
roam
at
will
over
at
least
two-thirds
of
the
inland
country
.
if
the
determination
of
spain
to
put
down
the
insurrection
seems
but
to
strengthen
with
the
lapse
of
time
and
is
evinced
by
her
unhesitating
devotion
of
largely
increased
military
and
naval
force
to
the
task
,
there
is
much
reason
to
believe
that
the
insurgent
have
gained
in
point
of
number
and
character
and
resource
and
are
none
the
le
inflexible
in
their
resolve
not
to
succumb
without
practically
securing
the
great
object
for
which
they
took
up
arm
.
if
spain
ha
not
yet
reestablished
her
authority
,
neither
have
the
insurgent
yet
made
good
their
title
to
be
regarded
a
an
independent
state
.
indeed
,
a
the
contest
ha
gone
on
the
pretense
that
civil
government
exists
on
the
island
,
except
so
far
a
spain
is
able
to
maintain
it
,
ha
been
practically
abandoned
.
spain
doe
keep
on
foot
such
a
government
,
more
or
le
imperfectly
,
in
the
large
town
and
their
immediate
suburb
;
but
that
exception
being
made
,
the
entire
country
is
either
given
over
to
anarchy
or
is
subject
to
the
military
occupation
of
one
or
the
other
party
.
it
is
reported
,
indeed
,
on
reliable
authority
that
at
the
demand
of
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
insurgent
army
the
putative
cuban
government
ha
now
given
up
all
attempt
to
exercise
it
function
,
leaving
that
government
confessedly
(
what
there
is
the
best
reason
for
supposing
it
always
to
have
been
in
fact
)
a
government
merely
on
paper
.
were
the
spanish
army
able
to
meet
their
antagonist
in
the
open
or
in
pitched
battle
,
prompt
and
decisive
result
might
be
looked
for
,
and
the
immense
superiority
of
the
spanish
force
in
number
,
discipline
,
and
equipment
could
hardly
fail
to
tell
greatly
to
their
advantage
.
but
they
are
called
upon
to
face
a
foe
that
shuns
general
engagement
,
that
can
choose
and
doe
choose
it
own
ground
,
that
from
the
nature
of
the
country
is
visible
or
invisible
at
pleasure
,
and
that
fight
only
from
ambuscade
and
when
all
the
advantage
of
position
and
number
are
on
it
side
.
in
a
country
where
all
that
is
indispensable
to
life
in
the
way
of
food
,
clothing
,
and
shelter
is
so
easily
obtainable
,
especially
by
those
born
and
bred
on
the
soil
,
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
hardly
a
limit
to
the
time
during
which
hostility
of
this
sort
may
be
prolonged
.
meanwhile
,
a
in
all
case
of
protracted
civil
strife
,
the
passion
of
the
combatant
grow
more
and
more
inflamed
and
excess
on
both
side
become
more
frequent
and
more
deplorable
.
they
are
also
participated
in
by
band
of
marauder
,
who
,
now
in
the
name
of
one
party
and
now
in
the
name
of
the
other
,
a
may
best
suit
the
occasion
,
harry
the
country
at
will
and
plunder
it
wretched
inhabitant
for
their
own
advantage
.
such
a
condition
of
thing
would
inevitably
entail
immense
destruction
of
property
,
even
if
it
were
the
policy
of
both
party
to
prevent
it
a
far
a
practicable
;
but
while
such
seemed
to
be
the
original
policy
of
the
spanish
government
,
it
ha
now
apparently
abandoned
it
and
is
acting
upon
the
same
theory
a
the
insurgent
,
namely
,
that
the
exigency
of
the
contest
require
the
wholesale
annihilation
of
property
that
it
may
not
prove
of
use
and
advantage
to
the
enemy
.
it
is
to
the
same
end
that
,
in
pursuance
of
general
order
,
spanish
garrison
are
now
being
withdrawn
from
plantation
and
the
rural
population
required
to
concentrate
itself
in
the
town
.
the
sure
result
would
seem
to
be
that
the
industrial
value
of
the
island
is
fast
diminishing
and
that
unless
there
is
a
speedy
and
radical
change
in
existing
condition
it
will
soon
disappear
altogether
.
that
value
consists
very
largely
,
of
course
,
in
it
capacity
to
produce
sugar
--
a
capacity
already
much
reduced
by
the
interruption
to
tillage
which
have
taken
place
during
the
last
two
year
.
it
is
reliably
asserted
that
should
these
interruption
continue
during
the
current
year
,
and
practically
extend
,
a
is
now
threatened
,
to
the
entire
sugar-producing
territory
of
the
island
,
so
much
time
and
so
much
money
will
be
required
to
restore
the
land
to
it
normal
productiveness
that
it
is
extremely
doubtful
if
capital
can
be
induced
to
even
make
the
attempt
.
the
spectacle
of
the
utter
ruin
of
an
adjoining
country
,
by
nature
one
of
the
most
fertile
and
charming
on
the
globe
,
would
engage
the
serious
attention
of
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
state
in
any
circumstance
.
in
point
of
fact
,
they
have
a
concern
with
it
which
is
by
no
mean
of
a
wholly
sentimental
or
philanthropic
character
.
it
lie
so
near
to
u
a
to
be
hardly
separated
from
our
territory
.
our
actual
pecuniary
interest
in
it
is
second
only
to
that
of
the
people
and
government
of
spain
.
it
is
reasonably
estimated
that
at
least
from
$
30,000,000
to
$
50,000,000
of
american
capital
are
invested
in
plantation
and
in
railroad
,
mining
,
and
other
business
enterprise
on
the
island
.
the
volume
of
trade
between
the
united
state
and
cuba
,
which
in
1889
amounted
to
about
$
64,000,000
,
rose
in
1893
to
about
$
103,000,000
,
and
in
1894
,
the
year
before
the
present
insurrection
broke
out
,
amounted
to
nearly
$
96,000,000
.
besides
this
large
pecuniary
stake
in
the
fortune
of
cuba
,
the
united
state
find
itself
inextricably
involved
in
the
present
contest
in
other
way
,
both
vexatious
and
costly
.
many
cuban
reside
in
this
country
,
and
indirectly
promote
the
insurrection
through
the
press
,
by
public
meeting
,
by
the
purchase
and
shipment
of
arm
,
by
the
raising
of
fund
,
and
by
other
mean
which
the
spirit
of
our
institution
and
the
tenor
of
our
law
do
not
permit
to
be
made
the
subject
of
criminal
prosecution
.
some
of
them
,
though
cuban
at
heart
and
in
all
their
feeling
and
interest
,
have
taken
out
paper
a
naturalized
citizen
of
the
united
state
--
a
proceeding
resorted
to
with
a
view
to
possible
protection
by
this
government
,
and
not
unnaturally
regarded
with
much
indignation
by
the
country
of
their
origin
.
the
insurgent
are
undoubtedly
encouraged
and
supported
by
the
widespread
sympathy
the
people
of
this
country
always
and
instinctively
feel
for
every
struggle
for
better
and
freer
government
,
and
which
,
in
the
case
of
the
more
adventurous
and
restless
element
of
our
population
,
lead
in
only
too
many
instance
to
active
and
personal
participation
in
the
contest
.
the
result
is
that
this
government
is
constantly
called
upon
to
protect
american
citizen
,
to
claim
damage
for
injury
to
person
and
property
,
now
estimated
at
many
million
of
dollar
,
and
to
ask
explanation
and
apology
for
the
act
of
spanish
official
whose
zeal
for
the
repression
of
rebellion
sometimes
blind
them
to
the
immunity
belonging
to
the
unoffending
citizen
of
a
friendly
power
.
it
follows
from
the
same
cause
that
the
united
state
is
compelled
to
actively
police
a
long
line
of
seacoast
against
unlawful
expedition
,
the
escape
of
which
the
utmost
vigilance
will
not
always
suffice
to
prevent
.
these
inevitable
entanglement
of
the
united
state
with
the
rebellion
in
cuba
,
the
large
american
property
interest
affected
,
and
consideration
of
philanthropy
and
humanity
in
general
have
led
to
a
vehement
demand
in
various
quarter
for
some
sort
of
positive
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
united
state
.
it
wa
at
first
proposed
that
belligerent
right
should
be
accorded
to
the
insurgent
--
a
proposition
no
longer
urged
because
untimely
and
in
practical
operation
dearly
perilous
and
injurious
to
our
own
interest
.
it
ha
since
been
and
is
now
sometimes
contended
that
the
independence
of
the
insurgent
should
be
recognized
;
but
imperfect
and
restricted
a
the
spanish
government
of
the
island
may
be
,
no
other
exists
there
,
unless
the
will
of
the
military
officer
in
temporary
command
of
a
particular
district
can
be
dignified
a
a
specie
of
government
.
it
is
now
also
suggested
that
the
united
state
should
buy
the
island
--
a
suggestion
possibly
worthy
of
consideration
if
there
were
any
evidence
of
a
desire
or
willingness
on
the
part
of
spain
to
entertain
such
a
proposal
.
it
is
urged
finally
that
,
all
other
method
failing
,
the
existing
internecine
strife
in
cuba
should
be
terminated
by
our
intervention
,
even
at
the
cost
of
a
war
between
the
united
state
and
spain
--
a
war
which
it
advocate
confidently
prophesy
could
neither
be
large
in
it
proportion
nor
doubtful
in
it
issue
.
the
correctness
of
this
forecast
need
be
neither
affirmed
nor
denied
.
the
united
state
ha
,
nevertheless
,
a
character
to
maintain
a
a
nation
,
which
plainly
dictate
that
right
and
not
might
should
be
the
rule
of
it
conduct
.
further
,
though
the
united
state
is
not
a
nation
to
which
peace
is
a
necessity
,
it
is
in
truth
the
most
pacific
of
power
and
desire
nothing
so
much
a
to
live
in
amity
with
all
the
world
.
it
own
ample
and
diversified
domain
satisfy
all
possible
longing
for
territory
,
preclude
all
dream
of
conquest
,
and
prevent
any
casting
of
covetous
eye
upon
neighboring
region
,
however
attractive
.
that
our
conduct
toward
spain
and
her
dominion
ha
constituted
no
exception
to
this
national
disposition
is
made
manifest
by
the
course
of
our
government
,
not
only
thus
far
during
the
present
insurrection
,
but
during
the
ten
year
that
followed
the
rising
at
yara
in
1868
.
no
other
great
power
,
it
may
safely
be
said
,
under
circumstance
of
similar
perplexity
,
would
have
manifested
the
same
restraint
and
the
same
patient
endurance
.
it
may
also
be
said
that
this
persistent
attitude
of
the
united
state
toward
spain
in
connection
with
cuba
unquestionably
evinces
no
slight
respect
and
regard
for
spain
on
the
part
of
the
american
people
.
they
in
truth
do
not
forget
her
connection
with
the
discovery
of
the
western
hemisphere
,
nor
do
they
underestimate
the
great
quality
of
the
spanish
people
nor
fail
to
fully
recognize
their
splendid
patriotism
and
their
chivalrous
devotion
to
the
national
honor
.
they
view
with
wonder
and
admiration
the
cheerful
resolution
with
which
vast
body
of
men
are
sent
across
thousand
of
mile
of
ocean
and
an
enormous
debt
accumulated
that
the
costly
possession
of
the
gem
of
the
antilles
may
still
hold
it
place
in
the
spanish
crown
.
and
yet
neither
the
government
nor
the
people
of
the
united
state
have
shut
their
eye
to
the
course
of
event
in
cuba
or
have
failed
to
realize
the
existence
of
conceded
grievance
which
have
led
to
the
present
revolt
from
the
authority
of
spain
--
grievance
recognized
by
the
queen
regent
and
by
the
cortes
,
voiced
by
the
most
patriotic
and
enlightened
of
spanish
statesman
,
without
regard
to
party
,
and
demonstrated
by
reform
proposed
by
the
executive
and
approved
by
the
legislative
branch
of
the
spanish
government
.
it
is
in
the
assumed
temper
and
disposition
of
the
spanish
government
to
remedy
these
grievance
,
fortified
by
indication
of
influential
public
opinion
in
spain
,
that
this
government
ha
hoped
to
discover
the
most
promising
and
effective
mean
of
composing
the
present
strife
with
honor
and
advantage
to
spain
and
with
the
achievement
of
all
the
reasonable
object
of
the
insurrection
.
it
would
seem
that
if
spain
should
offer
to
cuba
genuine
autonomy
--
a
measure
of
home
rule
which
,
while
preserving
the
sovereignty
of
spain
,
would
satisfy
all
rational
requirement
of
her
spanish
subject
--
there
should
be
no
just
reason
why
the
pacification
of
the
island
might
not
be
effected
on
that
basis
.
such
a
result
would
appear
to
be
in
the
true
interest
of
all
concerned
.
it
would
at
once
stop
the
conflict
which
is
now
consuming
the
resource
of
the
island
and
making
it
worthless
for
whichever
party
may
ultimately
prevail
.
it
would
keep
intact
the
possession
of
spain
without
touching
her
honor
,
which
will
be
consulted
rather
than
impugned
by
the
adequate
redress
of
admitted
grievance
.
it
would
put
the
prosperity
of
the
island
and
the
fortune
of
it
inhabitant
within
their
own
control
without
severing
the
natural
and
ancient
tie
which
bind
them
to
the
mother
country
,
and
would
yet
enable
them
to
test
their
capacity
for
self-government
under
the
most
favorable
condition
.
it
ha
been
objected
on
the
one
side
that
spain
should
not
promise
autonomy
until
her
insurgent
subject
lay
down
their
arm
;
on
the
other
side
,
that
promised
autonomy
,
however
liberal
,
is
insufficient
,
because
without
assurance
of
the
promise
being
fulfilled
.
but
the
reasonableness
of
a
requirement
by
spain
of
unconditional
surrender
on
the
part
of
the
insurgent
cuban
before
their
autonomy
is
conceded
is
not
altogether
apparent
.
it
ignores
important
feature
of
the
situation
--
the
stability
two
year
'
duration
ha
given
to
the
insurrection
;
the
feasibility
of
it
indefinite
prolongation
in
the
nature
of
thing
,
and
,
a
shown
by
past
experience
,
the
utter
and
imminent
ruin
of
the
island
unless
the
present
strife
is
speedily
composed
;
above
all
,
the
rank
abuse
which
all
party
in
spain
,
all
branch
of
her
government
,
and
all
her
leading
public
men
concede
to
exist
and
profess
a
desire
to
remove
.
facing
such
circumstance
,
to
withhold
the
proffer
of
needed
reform
until
the
party
demanding
them
put
themselves
at
mercy
by
throwing
down
their
arm
ha
the
appearance
of
neglecting
the
gravest
of
peril
and
inviting
suspicion
a
to
the
sincerity
of
any
professed
willingness
to
grant
reform
.
the
objection
on
behalf
of
the
insurgent
that
promised
reform
can
not
be
relied
upon
must
of
course
be
considered
,
though
we
have
no
right
to
assume
and
no
reason
for
assuming
that
anything
spain
undertakes
to
do
for
the
relief
of
cuba
will
not
be
done
according
to
both
the
spirit
and
the
letter
of
the
undertaking
.
nevertheless
,
realizing
that
suspicion
and
precaution
on
the
part
of
the
weaker
of
two
combatant
are
always
natural
and
not
always
unjustifiable
,
being
sincerely
desirous
in
the
interest
of
both
a
well
a
on
it
own
account
that
the
cuban
problem
should
be
solved
with
the
least
possible
delay
,
it
wa
intimated
by
this
government
to
the
government
of
spain
some
month
ago
that
if
a
satisfactory
measure
of
home
rule
were
tendered
the
cuban
insurgent
and
would
be
accepted
by
them
upon
a
guaranty
of
it
execution
the
united
state
would
endeavor
to
find
a
way
not
objectionable
to
spain
of
furnishing
such
graranty
.
while
no
definite
response
to
this
intimation
ha
yet
been
received
from
the
spanish
government
,
it
is
believed
to
be
not
altogether
unwelcome
,
while
,
a
already
suggested
,
no
reason
is
perceived
why
it
should
not
be
approved
by
the
insurgent
.
neither
party
can
fail
to
see
the
importance
of
early
action
,
and
both
must
realize
that
to
prolong
the
present
state
of
thing
for
even
a
short
period
will
add
enormously
to
the
time
and
labor
and
expenditure
necessary
to
bring
about
the
industrial
recuperation
of
the
island
.
it
is
therefore
fervently
hoped
on
all
ground
that
earnest
effort
for
healing
the
breach
between
spain
and
the
insurgent
cuban
upon
the
line
above
indicated
may
be
at
once
inaugurated
and
pushed
to
an
immediate
and
successful
issue
.
the
friendly
office
of
the
united
state
,
either
in
the
manner
above
outlined
or
in
any
other
way
consistent
with
our
constitution
and
law
,
will
always
be
at
the
disposal
of
either
party
.
whatever
circumstance
may
arise
,
our
policy
and
our
interest
would
constrain
u
to
object
to
the
acquisition
of
the
island
or
an
interference
with
it
control
by
any
other
power
.
it
should
be
added
that
it
can
not
be
reasonably
assumed
that
the
hitherto
expectant
attitude
of
the
united
state
will
be
indefinitely
maintained
.
while
we
are
anxious
to
accord
all
due
respect
to
the
sovereignty
of
spain
,
we
can
not
view
the
pending
conflict
in
all
it
feature
and
properly
apprehend
our
inevitably
close
relation
to
it
and
it
possible
result
without
considering
that
by
the
course
of
event
we
may
be
drawn
into
such
an
unusual
and
unprecedented
condition
a
will
fix
a
limit
to
our
patient
waiting
for
spain
to
end
the
contest
,
either
alone
and
in
her
own
way
or
with
our
friendly
cooperation
.
when
the
inability
of
spain
to
deal
successfully
with
the
insurrection
ha
become
manifest
and
it
is
demonstrated
that
her
sovereignty
is
extinct
in
cuba
for
all
purpose
of
it
rightful
existence
,
and
when
a
hopeless
struggle
for
it
reestablishment
ha
degenerated
into
a
strife
which
mean
nothing
more
than
the
useless
sacrifice
of
human
life
and
the
utter
destruction
of
the
very
subject-matter
of
the
conflict
,
a
situation
will
be
presented
in
which
our
obligation
to
the
sovereignty
of
spain
will
be
superseded
by
higher
obligation
,
which
we
can
hardly
hesitate
to
recognize
and
discharge
.
deferring
the
choice
of
way
and
method
until
the
time
for
action
arrives
,
we
should
make
them
depend
upon
the
precise
condition
then
existing
;
and
they
should
not
be
determined
upon
without
giving
careful
heed
to
every
consideration
involving
our
honor
and
interest
or
the
international
duty
we
owe
to
spain
.
until
we
face
the
contingency
suggested
or
the
situation
is
by
other
incident
imperatively
changed
we
should
continue
in
the
line
of
conduct
heretofore
pursued
,
thus
in
all
circumstance
exhibiting
our
obedience
to
the
requirement
of
public
law
and
our
regard
for
the
duty
enjoined
upon
u
by
the
position
we
occupy
in
the
family
of
nation
.
a
contemplation
of
emergency
that
may
arise
should
plainly
lead
u
to
avoid
their
creation
,
either
through
a
careless
disregard
of
present
duty
or
even
an
undue
stimulation
and
ill-timed
expression
of
feeling
.
but
i
have
deemed
it
not
amiss
to
remind
the
congress
that
a
time
may
arrive
when
a
correct
policy
and
care
for
our
interest
,
a
well
a
a
regard
for
the
interest
of
other
nation
and
their
citizen
,
joined
by
consideration
of
humanity
and
a
desire
to
see
a
rich
and
fertile
country
intimately
related
to
u
saved
from
complete
devastation
,
will
constrain
our
government
to
such
action
a
will
subserve
the
interest
thus
involved
and
at
the
same
time
promise
to
cuba
and
it
inhabitant
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
blessing
of
peace
.
the
venezuelan
boundary
question
ha
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
difference
between
great
britain
and
the
united
state
,
their
respective
government
having
agreed
upon
the
substantial
provision
of
a
treaty
between
great
britain
and
venezuela
submitting
the
whole
controversy
to
arbitration
.
the
provision
of
the
treaty
are
so
eminently
just
and
fair
that
the
assent
of
venezuela
thereto
may
confidently
be
anticipated
.
negotiation
for
a
treaty
of
general
arbitration
for
all
difference
between
great
britain
and
the
united
state
are
far
advanced
and
promise
to
reach
a
successful
consummation
at
an
early
date
.
the
scheme
of
examining
applicant
for
certain
consular
position
to
test
their
competency
and
fitness
,
adopted
under
an
executive
order
issued
on
the
20th
of
september
,
1895
,
ha
fully
demonstrated
the
usefulness
of
this
innovation
.
in
connection
with
this
plan
of
examination
promotion
and
transfer
of
deserving
incumbent
have
been
quite
extensively
made
,
with
excellent
result
.
during
the
past
year
35
appointment
have
been
made
in
the
consular
service
,
27
of
which
were
made
to
fill
vacancy
caused
by
death
or
resignation
or
to
supply
newly
created
post
,
2
to
succeed
incumbent
removed
for
cause
,
2
for
the
purpose
of
displacing
alien
consular
official
by
american
citizen
,
and
4
merely
changing
the
official
title
of
incumbent
from
commercial
agent
to
consul
.
twelve
of
these
appointment
were
transfer
or
promotion
from
other
position
under
the
department
of
state
,
4
of
those
appointed
had
rendered
previous
service
under
the
department
,
8
were
made
of
person
who
passed
a
satisfactory
examination
,
7
were
appointed
to
place
not
included
in
the
order
of
september
20
,
1895
,
and
4
appointment
,
a
above
stated
,
involved
no
change
of
incumbency
.
the
inspection
of
consular
office
provided
for
by
an
appropriation
for
that
purpose
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
ha
been
productive
of
such
wholesome
effect
that
i
hope
this
important
work
will
in
the
future
be
continued
.
i
know
of
nothing
that
can
be
done
with
the
same
slight
expense
so
improving
to
the
service
.
i
desire
to
repeat
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
last
annual
message
in
favor
of
providing
at
public
expense
official
residence
for
our
ambassador
and
minister
at
foreign
capital
.
the
reason
supporting
this
recommendation
are
strongly
stated
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
,
and
the
subject
seems
of
such
importance
that
i
hope
it
may
receive
the
early
attention
of
the
congress
.
we
have
during
the
last
year
labored
faithfully
and
against
unfavorable
condition
to
secure
better
preservation
of
seal
life
in
the
bering
sea
.
both
the
united
state
and
great
britain
have
lately
dispatched
commissioner
to
these
water
to
study
the
habit
and
condition
of
the
seal
herd
and
the
cause
of
their
rapid
decrease
.
upon
the
report
of
these
commissioner
,
soon
to
be
submitted
,
and
with
the
exercise
of
patience
and
good
sense
on
the
part
of
all
interested
party
,
it
is
earnestly
hoped
that
hearty
cooperation
may
be
secured
for
the
protection
against
threatened
extinction
of
seal
life
in
the
northern
pacific
and
bering
sea

which

attention

invited

exhibit
satisfactory
condition
in
the
several
branch
of
the
public
service
intrusted
to
his
charge
.
the
limit
of
our
military
force
a
fixed
by
law
is
constantly
and
readily
maintained
.
the
present
discipline
and
morale
of
our
army
are
excellent
,
and
marked
progress
and
efficiency
are
apparent
throughout
it
entire
organization

exception
of
delicate
duty
in
the
suppression

disturbance
along

change
in
method
of
administration
,
the
abandonment
of
unnecessary
post
and
consequent
concentration
of
troop
,
and
the
exercise
of
care
and
vigilance
by
the
various
officer
charged
with
the
responsibility
in
the
expenditure
of
the
appropriation
have
resulted
in
reducing
to
a
minimum
the
cost
of
maintenance
of
our
military
establishment
.
during
the
past
year
the
work
of
constructing
permanent
infantry
and
cavalry
post
ha
been
continued
at
the
place
heretofore
designated
.
the
secretary
of
war
repeat
his
recommendation
that
appropriation
for
barrack
and
quarter
should
more
strictly
conform
to
the
need
of
the
service
a
judged
by
the
department
rather
than
respond
to
the
wish
and
importunity
of
locality
.
it
is
imperative
that
much
of
the
money
provided
for
such
construction
should
now
be
allotted
to
the
erection
of
necessary
quarter
for
the
garrison
assigned
to
the
coast
defense
,
where
many
men
will
be
needed
to
properly
care
for
and
operate
modern
gun
.
it
is
essential
,
too
,
that
early
provision
be
made
to
supply
the
necessary
force
of
artillery
to
meet
the
demand
of
this
service
.
the
entire
army
ha
now
been
equipped
with
the
new
magazine
arm
,
and
wise
policy
demand
that
all
available
public
and
private
resource
should
be
so
employed
a
to
provide
within
a
reasonable
time
a
sufficient
number
to
supply
the
state
militia
with
these
modern
weapon
and
provide
an
ample
reserve
for
any
emergency
.
the
organized
militia
number
112,879
men
.
the
appropriation
for
it
support
by
the
several
state
approximate
$
2,800,000
annually
,
and
$
400,000
is
contributed
by
the
general
government
.
investigation
show
these
troop
to
be
usually
well
drilled
and
inspired
with
much
military
interest
,
but
in
many
instance
they
are
so
deficient
in
proper
arm
and
equipment
that
a
sudden
call
to
active
duty
would
find
them
inadequately
prepared
for
field
service
.
i
therefore
recommend
that
prompt
measure
be
taken
to
remedy
this
condition
and
that
every
encouragement
be
given
to
this
deserving
body
of
unpaid
and
voluntary
citizen
soldier
,
upon
whose
assistance
we
must
largely
rely
in
time
of
trouble
.
during
the
past
year
rapid
progress
ha
been
made
toward
the
completion
of
the
scheme
adopted
for
the
erection
and
armament
of
fortification
along
our
seacoast
,
while
equal
progress
ha
been
made
in
providing
the
material
for
submarine
defense
in
connection
with
these
work
.
it
is
peculiarly
gratifying
at
this
time
to
note
the
great
advance
that
ha
been
made
in
this
important
undertaking
since
the
date
of
my
annual
message
to
the
fifty-third
congress
at
the
opening
of
it
second
session
,
in
december
,
1893
.
at
that
time
i
informed
the
congress
of
the
approaching
completion
of
nine
12-inch
,
twenty
10-inch
,
and
thirty-four
8-inch
high-power
steel
gun
and
seventy-five
12-inch
rifled
mortar
.
this
total
then
seemed
insignificant
when
compared
with
the
great
work
remaining
to
be
done
.
yet
it
wa
none
the
le
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
every
citizen
when
he
reflected
that
it
represented
the
first
installment
of
the
new
ordnance
of
american
design
and
american
manufacture
and
demonstrated
our
ability
to
supply
from
our
own
resource
gun
of
unexcelled
power
and
accuracy
.
at
that
date
,
however
,
there
were
practically
no
carriage
upon
which
to
mount
these
gun
and
only
thirty-one
emplacement
for
gun
and
sixty-four
for
mortar
.
nor
were
all
these
emplacement
in
condition
to
receive
their
armament
.
only
one
high-power
gun
wa
at
that
time
in
position
for
the
defense
of
the
entire
coast
.
since
that
time
the
number
of
gun
actually
completed
ha
been
increased
to
a
total
of
twenty-one
12-inch
,
fifty-six
10-inch
,
sixty-one
8-inch
high-power
breech-loading
steel
gun
,
ten
rapid-fire
gun
,
and
eighty
12-inch
rifled
mortar
.
in
addition
there
are
in
process
of
construction
one
16-inch-type
gun
,
fifty
12-inch
,
fifty-six
10-inch
,
twenty-seven
8-inch
high-power
gun
,
and
sixty-six
12-inch
rifled
mortar
;
in
all
,
four
hundred
and
twenty-eight
gun
and
mortar
.
during
the
same
year
,
immediately
preceding
the
message
referred
to
,
the
first
modern
gun
carriage
had
been
completed
and
eleven
more
were
in
process
of
construction
.
all
but
one
were
of
the
nondisappearing
type
.
these
,
however
,
were
not
such
a
to
secure
necessary
cover
for
the
artillery
gunner
against
the
intense
fire
of
modern
machine
rapid-fire
and
high-power
gun
.
the
inventive
genius
of
ordnance
and
civilian
expert
ha
been
taxed
in
designing
carriage
that
would
obviate
this
fault
,
resulting
,
it
is
believed
,
in
the
solution
of
this
difficult
problem
.
since
1893
the
number
of
gun
carriage
constructed
or
building
ha
been
raised
to
a
total
of
129
,
of
which
90
are
on
the
disappearing
principle
,
and
the
number
of
mortar
carriage
to
152
,
while
the
95
emplacement
which
were
provided
for
prior
to
that
time
have
been
increased
to
280
built
and
building
.
this
improved
situation
is
largely
due
to
the
recent
generous
response
of
congress
to
the
recommendation
of
the
war
department
.
thus
we
shall
soon
have
complete
about
one-fifth
of
the
comprehensive
system
the
first
step
in
which
wa
noted
in
my
message
to
the
congress
of
december
4
,
1893
.
when
it
is
understood
that
a
masonry
emplacement
not
only
furnishes
a
platform
for
the
heavy
modern
high-power
gun
,
but
also
in
every
particular
serf
the
purpose
and
take
the
place
of
the
fort
of
former
day
,
the
importance
of
the
work
accomplished
is
better
comprehended
.
in
the
hope
that
the
work
will
be
prosecuted
with
no
le
vigor
in
the
future
,
the
secretary
of
war
ha
submitted
an
estimate
by
which
,
if
allowed
,
there
will
be
provided
and
either
built
or
building
by
the
end
of
the
next
fiscal
year
such
additional
gun
,
mortar
,
gun
carriage
,
and
emplacement
a
will
represent
not
far
from
one-third
of
the
total
work
to
be
done
under
the
plan
adopted
for
our
coast
defense
,
thus
affording
a
prospect
that
the
entire
work
will
be
substantially
completed
within
six
year
.
in
le
time
than
that
,
however
,
we
shall
have
attained
a
marked
degree
of
security
.
the
experience
and
result
of
the
past
year
demonstrate
that
with
a
continuation
of
present
careful
method
the
cost
of
the
remaining
work
will
be
much
le
than
the
original
estimate
.
we
should
always
keep
in
mind
that
of

while

give
the
sense
of
security
due
to
a
consciousness
of
strength
,
it
is
neither
the
purpose
nor
the
effect
of
such
permanent
fortification
to
involve

in

,
but
rather
to
guarantee

thus
they
are
thoroughly
in

with
all
the
tradition
of
our
national
diplomacy

the
attorney-general
present
a
detailed
and
interesting
statement
of
the
important
work
done
under
his
supervision
during
the
last
fiscal
year
.
the
ownership
and
management
by
the
government
of
penitentiary
for
the
confinement
of
those
convicted
in
united
state
court
of
violation
of
federal
law
,
which
for
many
year
ha
been
a
subject
of
executive
recommendation
,
have
at
last
to
a
slight
extent
been
realized
by
the
utilization
of
the
abandoned
military
prison
at
fort
leavenworth
a
a
united
state
penitentiary
.
this
is
certainly
a
movement
in
the
right
direction
,
but
it
ought
to
be
at
once
supplemented
by
the
rebuilding
or
extensive
enlargement
of
this
improvised
prison
and
the
construction
of
at
least
one
more
,
to
be
located
in
the
southern
state
.
the
capacity
of
the
leavenworth
penitentiary
is
so
limited
that
the
expense
of
it
maintenance
,
calculated
at
a
per
caput
rate
upon
the
number
of
prisoner
it
can
accommodate
,
doe
not
make
a
economical
an
exhibit
a
it
would
if
it
were
larger
and
better
adapted
to
prison
purpose
;
but
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
economy
,
humanity
,
and
a
proper
sense
of
responsibility
and
duty
toward
those
whom
we
punish
for
violation
of
federal
law
dictate
that
the
federal
government
should
have
the
entire
control
and
management
of
the
penitentiary
where
convicted
violator
are
confined
.
it
appears
that
since
the
transfer
of
the
fort
leavenworth
military
prison
to
it
new
us
the
work
previously
done
by
prisoner
confined
there
,
and
for
which
expensive
machinery
ha
been
provided
,
ha
been
discontinued
.
this
work
consisted
of
the
manufacture
of
article
for
army
use
,
now
done
elsewhere
.
on
all
ground
it
is
exceedingly
desirable
that
the
convict
confined
in
this
penitentiary
be
allowed
to
resume
work
of
this
description
.
it
is
most
gratifying
to
note
the
satisfactory
result
that
have
followed
the
inauguration
of
the
new
system
provided
for
by
the
act
of
may
28
,
1896
,
under
which
certain
federal
official
are
compensated
by
salary
instead
of
fee
.
the
new
plan
wa
put
in
operation
on
the
1st
day
of
july
,
1896
,
and
already
the
great
economy
it
enforces
,
it
prevention
of
abuse
,
and
it
tendency
to
a
better
enforcement
of
the
law
are
strikingly
apparent
.
detailed
evidence
of
the
usefulness
of
this
long-delayed
but
now
happily
accomplished
reform
will
be
found
clearly
set
forth
in
the
attorney-general
's
report
.
our
post-office
department
is
in
good
condition
,
and
the
exhibit
made
of
it
operation
during
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
30
,
1896
,
if
allowance
is
made
for
imperfection
in
the
law
applicable
to
it
,
is
very
satisfactory
.

the
year

pacific

and
credited

increase
of

over

previous
year
of

5,516,080.21

that
of
the
preceding

the
chief
expenditure
of
the
postal
service
are
regulated
by
law
and
are
not
in
the
control
of
the
postmaster-general
.
all
that
he
can
accomplish
by
the
most
watchful
administration
and
economy
is
to
enforce
prompt
and
thorough
collection
and
accounting
for
public
money
and
such
minor
saving
in
small
expenditure
and
in
letting
those
contract
,
for
post-office
supply
and
star
service
,
which
are
not
regulated
by
statute
.
an
effective
cooperation
between
the
auditor
's
office
and
the
post-office
department
and
the
making
and
enforcement
of
order
by
the
department
requiring
immediate
notification
to
their
surety
of
all
delinquency
on
the
part
of
postmaster
,
and
compelling
such
postmaster
to
make
more
frequent
deposit
of
postal
fund
,
have
resulted
in
a
prompter
auditing
of
their
account
and
much
le
default
to
the
government
than
heretofore
.
the
year
's
report
show
large
extension
of
both
star-route
service
and
railway
mail
service
,
with
increased
postal
facility
.
much
higher
accuracy
in
handling
mail
ha
also
been
reached
,
a
appears
by
the
decrease
of
error
in
the
railway
mail
service
and
the
reduction
of
mail
matter
returned
to
the
dead-letter
office
.
the
deficit
for
the
last
year
,
although
much
le
than
that
of
the
last
and
preceding
year
,
emphasizes
the
necessity
for
legislation
to
correct
the
growing
abuse
of
second-class
rate
,
to
which
the
deficiency
is
mainly
attributable
.

and
the

ought
certainly
to
be
discontinued
.
a
glance
at
the
revenue
received
for
the
work
done
last
year
will
show
more
plainly
than
any
other
statement
the
gross
abuse
of
the
postal
service

the
growing
waste

be
considered

it
thus
appears
that
though

more
than
two-thirds
of
the

the

the
growth
in
weight
of
second-class
matter
ha
been
from
299,000,000
pound
in
1894
to
312,000,000
in
1895
and
to
almost
349,000,000
in
1896
,
and
it
is
quite
evident
this
increasing
drawback
is
far
outstripping
any
possible
growth
of
postal
revenue
.
our
mail
service
should
of
course
be
such
a
to
meet
the
want
and
even
the
convenience
of
our
people
at
a
direct
charge
upon
them
so
light
a
perhaps
to
exclude
the
idea
of
our
post-office
department
being
a
money-making
concern
;
but
in
the
face
of
a
constantly
recurring
deficiency
in
it
revenue
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
supply
the
best
mail
service
in
the
world
it
seems
to
me
it
is
quite
time
to
correct
the
abuse
that
swell
enormously
our
annual
deficit
.
if
we
concede
the
public
policy
of
carrying
weekly
newspaper
free
in
the
county
of
publication
,
and
even
the
policy
of
carrying
at
le
than
one-tenth
of
their
cost
other
bona
fide
newspaper
and
periodical
,
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
subjecting
the
service
to
the
further
immense
and
increasing
loss
involved
in
carrying
at
the
nominal
rate
of
1
cent
a
pound
the
serial
library
,
sometimes
including
trashy
and
even
harmful
literature
,
and
other
matter
which
under
the
loose
interpretation
of
a
loose
statute
have
been
gradually
given
second-class
rate
,
thus
absorbing
all
profitable
return
derived
from
first-class
matter
,
which
pay
three
or
four
time
more
than
it
cost
,
and
producing
a
large
annual
loss
to
be
paid
by
general
taxation
.
if
such
second-class
matter
paid
merely
the
cost
of
it
handling
,
our
deficit
would
disappear
and
a
surplus
result
which
might
be
used
to
give
the
people
still
better
mail
facility
or
cheaper
rate
of
letter
postage
.
i
recommend
that
legislation
be
at
once
enacted
to
correct
these
abuse
and
introduce
better
business
idea
in
the
regulation
of
our
postal
rate
.
experience
and
observation
have
demonstrated
that
certain
improvement
in
the
organization
of
the
post-office
department
must
be
secured
before
we
can
gain
the
full
benefit
of
the
immense
sum
expended
in
it
administration
.
this
involves
the
following
reform
,
which
i
earnestly
recommend
:
there
should
be
a
small
addition
to
the
existing
inspector
service
,
to
be
employed
in
the
supervision
of
the
carrier
force
,
which
now
number
13,000
men
and
performs
it
service
practically
without
the
surveillance
exercised
over
all
other
branch
of
the
postal
or
public
service
.
of
course
such
a
lack
of
supervision
and
freedom
from
wholesome
disciplinary
restraint
must
inevitably
lead
to
imperfect
service
.
there
should
also
be
appointed
a
few
inspector
who
could
assist
the
central
office
in
necessary
investigation
concerning
matter
of
post-office
lease
,
post-office
site
,
allowance
for
rent
,
fuel
,
and
light
,
and
in
organizing
and
securing
the
best
result
from
the
work
of
the
14,000
clerk
now
employed
in
first
and
second
class
office
.
i
am
convinced
that
the
small
expense
attending
the
inauguration
of
these
reform
would
actually
be
a
profitable
investment
.
i
especially
recommend
such
a
recasting
of
the
appropriation
by
congress
for
the
post-office
department
a
will
permit
the
postmaster-general
to
proceed
with
the
work
of
consolidating
post-offices
.
this
work
ha
already
been
entered
upon
sufficiently
to
fully
demonstrate
by
experiment
and
experience
that
such
consolidation
is
productive
of
better
service
,
larger
revenue
,
and
le
expenditure
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
further
advantage
of
gradually
withdrawing
post-offices
from
the
spoil
system
.
the
universal
postal
union
,
which
now
embrace
all
the
civilized

whose
delegate

people
,
will
hold
it
fifth
congress
in
the
city
of
washington
in
may
,
1897
.
the
united
state
may
be
said
to
have
taken
the
initiative
which
led
to
the
first
meeting
of
this
congress
,
at
berne
in
1874
,
and
the
formation
of
the
universal
postal
union
,
which
brings
the
postal
service
of
all
country
to
every
man
's
neighborhood
and
ha
wrought
marvel
in
cheapening
postal
rate
and
securing
absolutely
safe
mail
communication
throughout
the
world
.

met
in

country
in

they
have
assembled
have
made
generous
provision
for
their
accommodation
and
for
the
reception
and
entertainment
of
the
delegate
.
in
view
of
the
importance
of
this
assemblage
and
of
it
deliberation
and
of
the
honor
and
hospitality
accorded
to
our
representative
by
other
country
on
similar
occasion
,
i
earnestly
hope
that
such
an
appropriation
will
be
made
for
the
expense
necessarily
attendant
upon
the
coming
meeting
in
our
capital
city
a
will
be
worthy
of
our
national
hospitality

indicative
of
our
appreciation

event

the
work
of
the
navy
department

it
present
condition
are
fully
exhibited
in

report
of
the
secretary

the
construction
of
vessel
for
our
new
navy
ha
been
energetically
prosecuted
by
the
present
administration
upon
the
general
line
previously
adopted
,
the
department
having
seen
no
necessity
for
radical
change
in
prior
method
,
under
which
the
work
wa
found
to
be
progressing
in
a
manner
highly
satisfactory
.
it
ha
been
decided
,
however
,
to
provide
in
every

contract
that
the
builder
should
pay

and
it
ha
also
been
determined
to
pay
no

the
premium
recently
earned
and
some
yet
to
be
decided

of
the

made

the
secretary
express
the
opinion
that
we
have
for
the
present
a
sufficient
supply
of
cruiser
and
gunboat
,
and
that
hereafter
the
construction
of
battle
ship
and
torpedo
boat
will
supply
our
need
.
much
attention
ha
been
given
to
the
method
of
carrying
on
departmental
business
.
important
modification
in
the
regulation
have
been
made
,
tending
to
unify
the
control
of
shipbuilding

far
a
may
be
under
the
bureau
of
construction
and
repair
,
and
also
to
improve
the
mode
of
purchasing
supply
for
the
navy
by
the
bureau
of
supply
and
account
.
the
establishment
under
recent
act
of
congress
of
a
supply
fund
with
which
to
purchase
these
supply
in
large
quantity
and
other
modification
of
method
have
tended
materially
to
their
cheapening
and
better
quality
.
the
war
college
ha
developed
into
an
institution
which
it
is
believed
will
be
of
great
value
to
the
navy
in
teaching
the
science
of
war
,
a
well
a
in
stimulating
professional
zeal
in
the
navy
,
and
it
will
be
especially
useful
in
the
devising
of
plan
for
the
utilization
in
case
of
necessity
of
all
the
naval
resource
of
the
united
state
.
the
secretary
ha
persistently
adhered
to
the
plan
he
found
in
operation
for
securing
labor
at
navy-yards
through
board
of
labor
employment
,
and
ha
done
much
to
make
it
more
complete
and
efficient
.
the
naval
officer
who
are
familiar
with
this
system
and
it
operation
express
the
decided
opinion
that
it
result
have
been
to
vastly
improve
the
character
of
the
work
done
at
our
yard
and
greatly
reduce
it
cost
.
discipline
among
the
officer
and
men
of
the
navy
ha
been
maintained
to
a
high
standard
and
the
percentage
of
american
citizen
enlisted
ha
been
very
much
increased
.
the
secretary
is
considering
and
will
formulate
during
the
coming
winter
a
plan
for
laying
up
ship
in
reserve
,
thereby
largely
reducing
the
cost
of
maintaining
our
vessel
afloat
.
this
plan
contemplates
that
battle
ship
,
torpedo
boat
,
and
such
of
the
cruiser
a
are
not
needed
for
active
service
at
sea
shall
be
kept
in
reserve
with
skeleton
crew
on
board
to
keep
them
in
condition
,
cruising
only
enough
to
insure
the
efficiency
of
the
ship
and
their
crew
in
time
of
activity
.
the
economy
to
result
from
this
system
is
too
obvious
to
need
comment
.
the
naval
militia
,
which
wa
authorized
a
few
year
ago
a
an
experiment
,
ha
now
developed
into
a
body
of
enterprising
young
men
,
active
and
energetic
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
and
promising
great
usefulness
.
this
establishment
ha
nearly
the
same
relation
to
our
navy
a
the
national
guard
in
the
different
state
bear
to
our
army
,
and
it
constitutes
a
source
of
supply
for
our
naval
force
the
importance
of
which
is
immediately
apparent
.
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
present
a
comprehensive
and
interesting
exhibit
of
the
numerous
and
important
affair
committed
to
his
supervision
.
it
is
impossible
in
this
communication
to
do
more
than
briefly
refer
to
a
few
of
the
subject
concerning
which
the
secretary
give
full
and
instructive
information
.
the
money
appropriated
on
account
of
this
department
and
for
it
disbursement
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
30
,
1896
,
amounted
to
more
than
$
157,000,000
,
or
a
greater
sum
than
wa
appropriated
for
the
entire
maintenance
of
the
government
for
the
two
fiscal
year
ended
june
30
,
1861
.
our
public
land
,
originally
amounting
to
1,840,000,000
acre
,
have
been
so
reduced
that
only
about
600,000,000
acre
still
remain
in
government
control
,
excluding
alaska
.
the
balance
,
being
by
far
the
most
valuable
portion
,
ha
been
given
away
to
settler
,
to
new
state
,
and
to
railroad
or
sold
at
a
comparatively
nominal
sum
.
the
patenting
of
land
in
execution
of
railroad
grant
ha
progressed
rapidly
during
the
year
,
and
since
the
4th
day
of
march
,
1893
,
about
25,000,000
acre
have
thus
been
conveyed
to
these
corporation
.
i
agree
with
the
secretary
that
the
remainder
of
our
public
land
should
be
more
carefully
dealt
with
and
their
alienation
guarded
by
better
economy
and
greater
prudence
.
the
commission
appointed
from
the
membership
of
the
national
academy
of
science
,
provided
for
by
an
act
of
congress
,
to
formulate
plan
for
a
national
forestry
system
will
,
it
is
hoped
,
soon
be
prepared
to
present
the
result
of
thorough
and
intelligent
examination
of
this
important
subject
.
the
total
indian
population
of
the
united
state
is
177,235
,
according
to
a
census
made
in
1895
,
exclusive
of
those
within
the
state
of
new
york
and
those
comprising
the
five
civilized
tribe
.
of
this
number
there
are
approximately
38,000
child
of
school
age
.
during
the
year
23,393
of
these
were
enrolled
in
school
.
the
progress
which
ha
attended
recent
effort
to
extend
indian-school
facility
and
the
anticipation
of
continued
liberal
appropriation
to
that
end
can
not
fail
to
afford
the
utmost
satisfaction
to
those
who
believe
that
the
education
of
indian
child
is
a
prime
factor
in
the
accomplishment
of
indian
civilization
.
it
may
be
said
in
general
term
that
in
every
particular
the
improvement
of
the
indian
under
government
care
ha
been
most
marked
and
encouraging
.
the
secretary
,
the
commissioner
of
indian
affair
,
and
the
agent
having
charge
of
indian
to
whom
allotment
have
been
made
strongly
urge
the
passage
of
a
law
prohibiting
the
sale
of
liquor
to
allottees
who
have
taken
their
land
in
severalty
.
i
earnestly
join
in
this
recommendation
and
venture
to
express
the
hope
that
the
indian
may
be
speedily
protected
against
this
greatest
of
all
obstacle
to
his
well-being
and
advancement
.
the
condition
of
affair
among
the
five
civilized
tribe
,
who
occupy
large
tract
of
land
in
the
indian
territory
and
who
have
government
of
their
own
,
ha
assumed
such
an
aspect
a
to
render
it
almost
indispensable
that
there
should
be
an
entire
change
in
the
relation
of
these
indian
to
the
general
government
.
this
seems
to
be
necessary
in
furtherance
of
their
own
interest
,
a
well
a
for
the
protection
of
non-indian
resident
in
their
territory
.
a
commission
organized
and
empowered
under
several
recent
law
is
now
negotiating
with
these
indian
for
the
relinquishment
of
their
court
and
the
division
of
their
common
land
in
severalty
and
are
aiding
in
the
settlement
of
the
troublesome
question
of
tribal
membership
.
the
reception
of
their
first
proffer
of
negotiation
wa
not
encouraging
,
but
through
patience
and
such
conduct
on
their
part
a
demonstrated
that
their
intention
were
friendly
and
in
the
interest
of
the
tribe
the
prospect
of
success
ha
become
more
promising
.
the
effort
should
be
to
save
these
indian
from
the
consequence
of
their
own
mistake
and
improvidence
and
to
secure
to
the
real
indian
his
right
a
against
intruder
and
professed
friend
who
profit
by
his
retrogression
.
a
change
is
also
needed
to
protect
life
and
property
through
the
operation
of
court
conducted
according
to
strict
justice
and
strong
enough
to
enforce
their
mandate
.
a
a
sincere
friend
of
the
indian
,
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
that
these
reform
should
be
accomplished
with
the
consent
and
aid
of
the
tribe
and
that
no
necessity
may
be
presented
for
radical
or
drastic
legislation
i
hope
,
therefore
,
that
the
commission
now
conducting
negotiation
will
soon
be
able
to
report
that
progress
ha
been
made
toward
a
friendly
adjustment
of
existing
difficulty
.
it
appears
that
a
very
valuable
deposit
of
gilsonite
or
asphaltum
ha
been
found
on
the
reservation
in
utah
occupied
by
the
uncompahgre
ute
indian
.
every
consideration
of
care
for
the
public
interest
and
every
sensible
business
reason
dictate
such
management
or
disposal
of
this
important
source
of
public
revenue
a
will
except
it
from
the
general
rule
and
incident
attending
the
ordinary
disposition
of
public
land
and
secure
to
the
government
a
fair
share
at
least
of
it
advantage
in
place
of
it
transfer
for
a
nominal
sum
to
interested
individual
.
i
indorse
the
recommendation
made
by
the
present
secretary
of
the
interior
,
a
well
a
his
predecessor
,
that
a
permanent
commission
,
consisting
of
three
member
,
one
of
whom
shall
be
an
army
officer
,
be
created
to
perform
the
duty
now
devolving
upon
the
commissioner
and
assistant
commissioner
of
indian
affair
.
the
management
of
the
bureau
involves
such
numerous
and
diverse
detail
and
the
advantage
of
an
uninterrupted
policy
are
so
apparent
that
i
hope
the
change
suggested
will
meet
the
approval
of
the
congress
.
the
diminution
of
our
enormous
pension
roll
and
the
decrease
of
pension
expenditure
,
which
have
been
so
often
confidently
for
told
,
still
fail
in
material
realization
.
the
number
of
pensioner
on
the
poll
at
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
30
,
1896
,
wa
970,678
.
this
is
the
largest
number
ever
reported
.
the
amount
paid
exclusively
for
pension
during
the
year
wa
$
138,214,761.94
,
a
slight
decrease
from
that
of
the
preceding
year
,
while
the
total
expenditure
on
account
of
pension
,
including
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
department
and
expense
attending
pension
distribution
,
amounted
to
$
142,206,550.59
,
or
within
every
small
fraction
of
one-third
of
the
entire
expense
of
supporting
the
government
during
the
same
year
.
the
number
of
new
pension
certificate
issued
wa
90,640
.
of
these
,
40,374
represent
original
allowance
of
claim
and
15,878
increase
of
existing
pension
.
the
number
of
person
receiving
pension
from
the
united
state
,
but
residing
in
foreign
country
,
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
wa
3,781
,
and
the
amount
paid
to
them
during
the
year
wa
$
582,735.38
.
the
sum
appropriated
for
the
payment
of
pension
for
the
current
fiscal
year
,
ending
june
30
,
1897
,
is
$
140,000,000
,
and
for
the
succeeding
year
it
is
estimated
that
the
same
amount
will
be
necessary
.
the
commissioner
of
pension
report
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
339
indictment
were
found
against
violator
of
the
pension
law
.
upon
these
indictment
167
conviction
resulted
.
in
my
opinion
,
based
upon
such
statement
a
these
and
much
other
information
and
observation
,
the
abuse
which
have
been
allowed
to
creep
into
our
pension
system
have
done
incalculable
harm
in
demoralizing
our
people
and
undermining
good
citizenship
.
i
have
endeavored
within
my
sphere
of
official
duty
to
protect
our
pension
roll
and
make
it
what
it
should
be
,
a
roll
of
honor
,
containing
the
name
of
those
disabled
in
their
country
's
service
and
worthy
of
their
country
's
affectionate
remembrance
.
when
i
have
seen
those
who
pose
a
the
soldier
'
friend
active
and
alert
in
urging
greater
laxity
and
more
reckless
pension
expenditure
,
while
nursing
selfish
scheme
,
i
have
deprecated
the
approach
of
a
situation
when
necessary
retrenchment
and
enforced
economy
may
lead
to
an
attack
upon
pension
abuse
so
determined
a
to
overlook
the
discrimination
due
to
those
who
,
worthy
of
a
nation
's
care
,
ought
to
live
and
die
under
the
protection
of
a
nation
's
gratitude
.
the
secretary
call
attention
to
the
public
interest
involved
in
an
adjustment
of
the
obligation
of
the
pacific
railroad
to
the
government
.
i
deem
it
to
be
an
important
duty
to
especially
present
this
subject
to
the
consideration
of
the
congress
.
on
january
1
,
1897
,
with
the
amount
already
matured
,
more
than
$
13,000,000
of
the
principal
of
the
subsidy
bond
issued
by
the
united
state
in
aid
of
the
construction
of
the
union
pacific
railway
,
including
it
kansa
line
,
and
more
than
$
6,000,000
of
like
bond
issued
in
aid
of
the
central
pacific
railroad
,
including
those
issued
to
the
western
pacific
railroad
company
,
will
have
fallen
due
and
been
paid
or
must
on
that
day
be
paid
by
the
government
.
without
any
reference
to
the
application
of
the
sinking
fund
now
in
the
treasury
,
this
will
create
such
a
default
on
the
part
of
these
company
to
the
government
a
will
give
it
the
right
to
at
once
institute
proceeding
to
foreclose
it
mortgage
lien
.
in
addition
to
this
indebtedness
,
which
will
be
due
january
1
,
1897
,
there
will
mature
between
that
date
and
january
1
,
1899
,
the
remaining
principal
of
such
subsidy
bond
,
which
must
also
be
met
by
the
government
.
these
amount
to
more
than
$
20,000,000
on
account
of
the
union
pacific
line
and
exceed
$
21,000,000
on
account
of
the
central
pacific
line
.
the
situation
of
these
road
and
the
condition
of
their
indebtedness
to
the
government
have
been
fully
set
forth
in
the
report
of
various
committee
to
the
present
and
prior
congress
,
and
a
early
a
1887
they
were
thoroughly
examined
by
a
special
commission
appointed
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress
.
the
consideration
requiring
an
adjustment
of
the
government
's
relation
to
the
company
have
been
clearly
presented
and
the
conclusion
reached
with
practical
uniformity
that
if
these
relation
are
not
terminated
they
should
be
revised
upon
a
basis
securing
their
safe
continuance
.
under
section
4
of
the
act
of
congress
passed
march
3
,
1887
,
the
president
is
charged
with
the
duty
,
in
the
event
that
any
mortgage
or
other
incumbrance
paramount
to
the
interest
of
the
united
state
in
the
property
of
the
pacific
railroad
should
exist
and
be
lawfully
liable
to
be
enforced
,
to
direct
the
action
of
the
department
of
treasury
and
of
justice
in
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
united
state
by
redemption
or
through
judicial
proceeding
,
including
foreclosure
of
the
government
lien
.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
ha
for
a
number
of
year
almost
constantly
had
under
consideration
various
plan
for
dealing
with
the
condition
existing
between
these
road
and
the
government
,
i
have
thus
far
felt
justified
in
withholding
action
under
the
statute
above
mentioned
.
in
the
case
of
the
union
pacific
company
,
however
,
the
situation
ha
become
especially
and
immediately
urgent
.
proceeding
have
been
instituted
to
foreclose
a
first
mortgage
upon
those
aided
part
of
the
main
line
upon
which
the
government
hold
a
second
and
subordinate
mortgage
lien
.
in
consequence
of
those
proceeding
and
increasing
complication
,
added
to
the
default
occurring
on
the
1st
day
of
january
,
1897
,
a
condition
will
be
presented
at
that
date
,
so
far
a
this
company
is
concerned
,
that
must
emphasize
the
mandate
of
the
act
of
1887
and
give
to
executive
duty
under
it
provision
a
more
imperative
aspect
.
therefore
,
unless
congress
shall
otherwise
direct
or
shall
have
previously
determined
upon
a
different
solution
of
the
problem
,
there
will
hardly
appear
to
exist
any
reason
for
delaying
beyond
the
date
of
the
default
above
mentioned
such
executive
action
a
will
promise
to
subserve
the
public
interest
and
save
the
government
from
the
loss
threatened
by
further
inaction
.
the
department
of
agriculture
is
so
intimately
related
to
the
welfare
of
our
people
and
the
prosperity
of
our
nation
that
it
should
constantly
receive
the
care
and
encouragement
of
the
government
.
from
small
beginning
it
ha
grown
to
be
the
center
of
agricultural
intelligence
and
the
source
of
aid
and
encouragement
to
agricultural
effort
.
large
sum
of
money
are
annually
appropriated
for
the
maintenance
of
this
department
,
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
legislation
relating
to
it
ha
not
always
been
directly
in
the
interest
of
practical
farming
or
properly
guarded
against
waste
and
extravagance
.
so
far
,
however
,
a
public
money
ha
been
appropriated
fairly
and
sensibly
to
help
those
who
actually
till
the
soil
,
no
expenditure
ha
been
more
profitably
made
or
more
generally
approved
by
the
people
.
under
the
present
management
of
the
department
it
usefulness
ha
been
enhanced
in
every
direction
,
and
at
the
same
time
strict
economy
ha
been
enforced
to
the
utmost
extent
permitted
by
congressional
action
.
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
it
appears
that
through
careful
and
prudent
financial
management
he
ha
annually
saved
a
large
sum
from
his
appropriation
,
aggregating
during
his
incumbency
and
up
to
the
close
of
the
present
fiscal
year
nearly
one-fifth
of
the
entire
amount
appropriated
.
these
result
have
been
accomplished
by
a
conscientious
study
of
the
real
need
of
the
farmer
and
such
a
regard
for
economy
a
the
genuine
farmer
ought
to
appreciate
,
supplemented
by
a
rigid
adherence
to
civil-service
method
in
a
department
which
should
be
conducted
in
the
interest
of
agriculture
instead
of
partisan
politics
.
the
secretary
report
that
the
value
of
our
export
of
farm
product
during
the
last
fiscal
year
amounted
to
$
570,000,000
,
an
increase
of
$
17,000,000
over
those
of
the
year
immediately
preceding
.
this
statement
is
not
the
le
welcome
because
of
the
fact
that
,
notwithstanding
such
increase
,
the
proportion
of
exported
agricultural
product
to
our
total
export
of
all
description
fell
off
during
the
year
.
the
benefit
of
an
increase
in
agricultural
export
being
assured
,
the
decrease
in
it
proportion
to
our
total
export
is
the
more
gratifying
when
we
consider
that
it
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
such
total
export
for
the
year
increased
more
than
$
75,000,000
.
the
large
and
increasing
exportation
of
our
agricultural
product
suggests
the
great
usefulness
of
the
organization
lately
established
in
the
department
for
the
purpose
of
giving
to
those
engaged
in
farming
pursuit
reliable
information
concerning
the
condition
,
need
,
and
advantage
of
different
foreign
market
.
inasmuch
a
the
success
of
the
farmer
depends
upon
the
advantageous
sale
of
his
product
,
and
inasmuch
a
foreign
market
must
largely
be
the
destination
of
such
product
,
it
is
quite
apparent
that
a
knowledge
of
the
condition
and
want
that
affect
those
market
ought
to
result
in
sowing
more
intelligently
and
reaping
with
a
better
promise
of
profit
.
such
information
point
out
the
way
to
a
prudent
foresight
in
the
selection
and
cultivation
of
crop
and
to
a
release
from
the
bondage
of
unreasoning
monotony
of
production
,
a
glutted
and
depressed
market
,
and
constantly
recurring
unprofitable
toil
.
in
my
opinion
the
gratuitous
distribution
of
seed
by
the
department
a
at
present
conducted
ought
to
be
discontinued
.
no
one
can
read
the
statement
of
the
secretary
on
this
subject
and
doubt
the
extravagance
and
questionable
result
of
this
practice
.
the
professed
friend
of
the
farmer
,
and
certainly
the
farmer
themselves
,
are
naturally
expected
to
be
willing
to
rid
a
department
devoted
to
the
promotion
of
farming
interest
of
a
feature
which
tends
so
much
to
it
discredit
.
the
weather
bureau
,
now
attached
to
the
department
of
agriculture
,
ha
continued
to
extend
it
sphere
of
usefulness
,
and
by
an
uninterrupted
improvement
in
the
accuracy
of
it
forecast
ha
greatly
increased
it
efficiency
a
an
aid
and
protection
to
all
whose
occupation
are
related
to
weather
condition
.
omitting
further
reference
to
the
operation
of
the
department
,
i
commend
the
secretary's
report
and
the
suggestion
it
contains
to
the
careful
consideration
of
the
congress
.
the
progress
made
in
civil-service
reform
furnishes
a
cause
for
the
utmost
congratulation
.
it
ha
survived
the
doubt
of
it
friend
a
well
a
the
rancor
of
it
enemy
and
ha
gained
a
permanent
place
among
the
agency
destined
to
cleanse
our
politics
and
to
improve
,
economize
,
and
elevate
the
public
service
.
there
are
now
in
the
competitive
classified
service
upward
of
84,000
place
,
more
than
half
of
these
having
been
included
from
time
to
time
since
march
4
,
1893
.
a
most
radical
and
sweeping
extension
wa
made
by
executive
order
dated
the
6th
day
of
may
,
1896
,
and
if
fourth-class
postmasterships
are
not
included
in
the
statement
it
may
be
said
that
practically
all
position
contemplated
by
the
civil-service
law
are
now
classified
.
abundant
reason
exist
for
including
these
postmaster-ships
,
based
upon
economy
,
improved
service
,
and
the
peace
and
quiet
of
neighborhood
.
if
,
however
,
obstacle
prevent
such
action
at
present
,
i
earnestly
hope
that
congress
will
,
without
increasing
post-office
appropriation
,
so
adjust
them
a
to
permit
in
proper
eas
a
consolidation
of
these
post-offices
,
to
the
end
that
through
this
process
the
result
desired
may
to
a
limited
extent
be
accomplished
.
the
civil-service
rule
a
amended
during
the
last
year
provide
for
a
sensible
and
uniform
method
of
promotion
,
basing
eligibility
to
better
position
upon
demonstrated
efficiency
and
faithfulness
.
the
absence
of
fixed
rule
on
this
subject
ha
been
an
infirmity
in
the
system
more
and
more
apparent
a
it
other
benefit
have
been
better
appreciated
.
the
advantage
of
civil-service
method
in
their
business
aspect
are
too
well
understood
to
require
argument
.
their
application
ha
become
a
necessity
to
the
executive
work
of
the
government
.
but
those
who
gain
position
through
the
operation
of
these
method
should
be
made
to
understand
that
the
nonpartisan
scheme
through
which
they
receive
their
appointment
demand
from
them
by
way
of
reciprocity
nonpartisan
and
faithful
performance
of
duty
under
every
administration
and
cheerful
fidelity
to
every
chief
.
while
they
should
be
encouraged
to
decently
exercise
their
right
of
citizenship
and
to
support
through
their
suffrage
the
political
belief
they
honestly
profess
,
the
noisy
,
pestilent
,
and
partisan
employee
,
who
love
political
turmoil
and
contention
or
who
render
lax
and
grudging
service
to
an
administration
not
representing
his
political
view
,
should
be
promptly
and
fearlessly
dealt
with
in
such
a
way
a
to
furnish
a
warning
to
others
who
may
be
likewise
disposed
.
the
annual
report
of
the
commissioner
will
be
duly
transmitted
,
and
i
commend
the
important
matter
they
have
in
charge
to
the
careful
consideration
of
the
congress
.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
ha
during
the
last
year
supplied
abundant
evidence
of
it
usefulness
and
the
importance
of
the
work
committed
to
it
charge
.
public
transportation
is
a
universal
necessity
,
and
the
question
of
just
and
reasonable
charge
therefor
ha
become
of
vital
importance
not
only
to
shipper
and
carrier
,
but
also
to
the
vast
multitude
of
producer
and
consumer
.
the
justice
and
equity
of
the
principle
embodied
in
the
existing
law
passed
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
these
charge
are
everywhere
conceded
,
and
there
appears
to
be
no
question
that
the
policy
thus
entered
upon
ha
a
permanent
place
in
our
legislation
.
a
the
present
statute
when
enacted
wa
in
the
nature
of
the
case
more
or
le
tentative
and
experimental
,
it
wa
hardly
expected
to
supply
a
complete
and
adequate
system
.
while
it
wholesome
effect
are
manifest
and
have
amply
justified
it
enactment
,
it
is
evident
that
all
desired
reform
in
transportation
method
have
not
been
fully
accomplished
.
in
view
of
the
judicial
interpretation
which
some
provision
of
this
statute
have
received
and
the
defect
disclosed
by
the
effort
made
for
it
enforcement
,
it
revision
and
amendment
appear
to
be
essential
,
to
the
end
that
it
may
more
effectually
reach
the
evil
designed
to
be
corrected
.
i
hope
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
upon
this
subject
will
be
promptly
and
favorably
considered
by
the
congress
.
i
desire
to
recur
to
the
statement
elsewhere
made
concerning
the
government
's
receipt
and
expenditure
for
the
purpose
of
venturing
upon
some
suggestion
touching
our
present
tariff
law
and
it
operation
.
this
statute
took
effect
on
the
28th
day
of
august
,
1894
.
whatever
may
be
it
shortcoming
a
a
complete
measure
of
tariff
reform
,
it
must
be
conceded
that
it
ha
opened
the
way
to
a
freer
and
greater
exchange
of
commodity
between
u
and
other
country
,
and
thus
furnished
a
wider
market
for
our
product
and
manufacture
.
the
only
entire
fiscal
year
during
which
this
law
ha
been
in
force
ended
on
the
30th
day
of
june
,
1896
.
in
that
year
our
import
increased
over
those
of
the
previous
year
more
than
$
6,500,000
,
while
the
value
of
the
domestic
product
we
exported
and
which
found
market
abroad
wa
nearly
$
70,000,000
more
than
during
the
preceding
year
.
those
who
insist
that
the
cost
to
our
people
of
article
coming
to
them
from
abroad
for
their
needful
use
should
only
be
increased
through
tariff
charge
to
an
extent
necessary
to
meet
the
expense
of
the
government
,
a
well
a
those
who
claim
that
tariff
charge
may
be
laid
upon
such
article
beyond
the
necessity
of
government
revenue
and
with
the
additional
purpose
of
so
increasing
their
price
in
our
market
a
to
give
american
manufacturer
and
producer
better
and
more
profitable
opportunity
,
must
agree
that
our
tariff
law
are
only
primarily
justified
a
source
of
revenue
to
enable
the
government
to
meet
the
necessary
expense
of
it
maintenance
.
considered
a
to
it
efficiency
in
this
aspect
,
the
present
law
can
by
no
mean
fall
under
just
condemnation
.
during
the
only
complete
fiscal
year
of
it
operation
it
ha
yielded
nearly
$
8,000,000
more
revenue
than
wa
received
from
tariff
duty
in
the
preceding
year
.
there
wa
,
nevertheless
,
a
deficit
between
our
receipt
and
expenditure
of
a
little
more
than
$
25,000,000
this
,
however
,
wa
not
unexpected
.
the
situation
wa
such
in
december
last
,
seven
month
before
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
,
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
foretold
a
deficiency
of
$
17,000,000
.
the
great
and
increasing
apprehension
and
timidity
in
business
circle
and
the
depression
in
all
activity
intervening
since
that
time
,
resulting
from
cause
perfectly
well
understood
and
entirely
disconnected
with
our
tariff
law
or
it
operation
,
seriously
checked
the
import
we
would
have
otherwise
received
and
readily
account
for
the
difference
between
this
estimate
of
the
secretary
and
the
actual
deficiency
,
a
well
a
for
a
continued
deficit
.
indeed
,
it
must
be
confessed
that
we
could
hardly
have
had
a
more
unfavorable
period
than
the
last
two
year
for
the
collection
of
tariff
revenue
.
we
can
not
reasonably
hope
that
our
recuperation
from
this
business
depression
will
be
sudden
,
but
it
ha
already
set
in
with
a
promise
of
acceleration
and
continuance
.
i
believe
our
present
tariff
law
,
if
allowed
a
fair
opportunity
,
will
in
the
near
future
yield
a
revenue
which
,
with
reasonably
economical
expenditure
,
will
overcome
all
deficiency
.
in
the
meantime
no
deficit
that
ha
occurred
or
may
occur
need
excite
or
disturb
u
.
to
meet
any
such
deficit
we
have
in
the
treasury
in
addition
to
a
gold
reserve
of
one
hundred
million
a
surplus
of
more
than
$
128,000,000
applicable
to
the
payment
of
the
expense
of
the
government
,
and
which
must
,
unless
expended
for
that
purpose
,
remain
a
useless
hoard
,
or
,
if
not
extravagantly
wasted
,
must
in
any
event
be
perverted
from
the
purpose
of
it
exaction
from
our
people
.
the
payment
,
therefore
,
of
any
deficiency
in
the
revenue
from
this
fund
is
nothing
more
than
it
proper
and
legitimate
use
.
the
government
thus
applying
a
surplus
fortunately
in
it
treasury
to
the
payment
of
expense
not
met
by
it
current
revenue
is
not
at
all
to
be
likened
to
a
man
living
beyond
his
income
and
thus
incurring
debt
or
encroaching
on
his
principal
.
it
is
not
one
of
the
function
of
our
government
to
accumulate
and
make
addition
to
a
fund
not
needed
for
immediate
expenditure
.
with
individual
it
is
the
chief
object
of
struggle
and
effort
.
the
application
of
an
accumulated
fund
by
the
government
to
the
payment
of
it
running
expense
is
a
duty
.
an
individual
living
beyond
his
income
and
embarrassing
himself
with
debt
or
drawing
upon
his
accumulated
fund
of
principal
is
either
unfortunate
or
improvident
.
the
distinction
is
between
a
government
charged
with
the
duty
of
expending
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
and
for
proper
purpose
all
the
money
it
receives
from
any
source
,
and
the
individual
,
who
is
expected
to
manifest
a
natural
desire
to
avoid
debt
or
to
accumulate
a
much
a
possible
and
to
live
within
the
income
derived
from
such
accumulation
,
to
the
end
that
they
may
be
increased
or
at
least
remain
unimpaired
for
the
future
use
and
enjoyment
of
himself
or
the
object
of
his
love
and
affection
who
may
survive
him
.
it
is
immeasurably
better
to
appropriate
our
surplus
to
the
payment
of
justifiable
expense
than
to
allow
it
to
become
an
invitation
to
reckless
appropriation
and
extravagant
expenditure
.
i
suppose
it
will
not
be
denied
that
under
the
present
law
our
people
obtain
the
necessary
of
a
comfortable
existence
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
formerly
.
this
is
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
,
since
it
is
the
palpable
duty
of
every
just
government
to
make
the
burden
of
taxation
a
light
a
possible
.
the
people
should
not
be
required
to
relinquish
this
privilege
of
cheaper
living
except
under
the
stress
of
their
government
's
necessity
made
plainly
manifest
.
this
reference
to
the
condition
and
prospect
of
our
revenue
naturally
suggests
an
allusion
to
the
weakness
and
vice
of
our
financial
method
.
they
have
been
frequently
pressed
upon
the
attention
of
congress
in
previous
executive
communication
and
the
inevitable
danger
of
their
continued
toleration
pointed
out
.
without
now
repeating
these
detail
,
i
can
not
refrain
from
again
earnestly
presenting
the
necessity
of
the
prompt
reform
of
a
system
opposed
to
every
rule
of
sound
finance
and
shown
by
experience
to
be
fraught
with
the
gravest
peril
and
perplexity
.
the
terrible
civil
war
,
which
shook
the
foundation
of
our
government
more
than
thirty
year
ago
,
brought
in
it
train
the
destruction
of
property
,
the
wasting
of
our
country
's
substance
,
and
the
estrangement
of
brother
.
these
are
now
past
and
forgotten
.
even
the
distressing
loss
of
life
the
conflict
entailed
is
but
a
sacred
memory
which
foster
patriotic
sentiment
and
keep
alive
a
tender
regard
for
those
who
nobly
died
.
and
yet
there
remains
with
u
to-day
in
full
strength
and
activity
,
a
an
incident
of
that
tremendous
struggle
,
a
feature
of
it
financial
necessity
not
only
unsuited
to
our
present
circumstance
,
but
manifestly
a
disturbing
menace
to
business
security
and
an
ever-present
agent
of
monetary
distress
.
because
we
may
be
enjoying
a
temporary
relief
from
it
depressing
influence
,
this
should
not
lull
u
into
a
false
security
nor
lead
u
to
forget
the
suddenness
of
past
visitation
.
i
am
more
convinced
than
ever
that
we
can
have
no
assured
financial
peace
and
safety
until
the
government
currency
obligation
upon
which
gold
may
be
demanded
from
the
treasury
are
withdrawn
from
circulation
and
canceled
.
this
might
be
done
,
a
ha
been
heretofore
recommended
,
by
their
exchange
for
long-term
bond
bearing
a
low
rate
of
interest
or
by
their
redemption
with
the
proceeds
of
such
bond
.
even
if
only
the
united
state
note
known
a
greenback
were
thus
retired
it
is
probable
that
the
treasury
note
issued
in
payment
of
silver
purchase
under
the
act
of
july
14
,
1890
,
now
paid
in
gold
when
demanded
,
would
not
create
much
disturbance
,
a
they
might
from
time
to
time
,
when
received
in
the
treasury
by
redemption
in
gold
or
otherwise
,
be
gradually
and
prudently
replaced
by
silver
coin
.
this
plan
of
issuing
bond
for
the
purpose
of
redemption
certainly
appears
to
be
the
most
effective
and
direct
path
to
the
needed
reform
.
in
default
of
this
,
however
,
it
would
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
if
currency
obligation
redeemable
in
gold
whenever
so
redeemed
should
be
canceled
instead
of
being
reissued
.
this
operation
would
be
a
slow
remedy
,
but
it
would
improve
present
condition
.
national
bank
should
redeem
their
own
note
.
they
should
be
allowed
to
issue
circulation
to
the
par
value
of
bond
deposited
a
security
for
it
redemption
and
the
tax
on
their
circulation
should
be
reduced
to
one-fourth
of
1
per
cent
.
in
considering
project
for
the
retirement
of
united
state
note
and
treasury
note
issued
under
the
law
of
1890
,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
we
have
placed
too
much
stress
upon
the
danger
of
contracting
the
currency
and
have
calculated
too
little
upon
the
gold
that
would
be
added
to
our
circulation
if
invited
to
u
by
better
and
safer
financial
method
.
it
is
not
so
much
a
contraction
of
our
currency
that
should
be
avoided
a
it
unequal
distribution
.
this
might
be
obviated
and
any
fear
of
harmful
contraction
at
the
same
time
removed
by
allowing
the
organization
of
smaller
bank
and
in
le
populous
community
than
are
now
permitted
,
and
also
authorizing
existing
bank
to
establish
branch
in
small
community
under
proper
restriction
.
the
entire
case
may
be
presented
by
the
statement
that
the
day
of
sensible
and
sound
financial
method
will
not
dawn
upon
u
until
our
government
abandon
the
banking
business
and
the
accumulation
of
fund
and
confines
it
monetary
operation
to
the
receipt
of
the
money
contributed
by
the
people
for
it
support
and
to
the
expenditure
of
such
money
for
the
people
's
benefit
.
our
business
interest
and
all
good
citizen
long
for
rest
from
feverish
agitation
and
the
inauguration
by
the
government
of
a
reformed
financial
policy
which
will
encourage
enterprise
and
make
certain
the
reward
of
labor
and
industry
.
another
topic
in
which
our
people
rightfully
take
a
deep
interest
may
be
here
briefly
considered
.
i
refer
to
the
existence
of
trust
and
other
huge
aggregation
of
capital
the
object
of
which
is
to
secure
the
monopoly
of
some
particular
branch
of
trade
,
industry
,
or
commerce
and
to
stifle
wholesome
competition
.
when
these
are
defended
,
it
is
usually
on
the
ground
that
though
they
increase
profit
they
also
reduce
price
,
and
thus
may
benefit
the
public
.
it
must
be
remembered
,
however
,
that
a
reduction
of
price
to
the
people
is
not
one
of
the
real
object
of
these
organization
,
nor
is
their
tendency
necessarily
in
that
direction
.
if
it
occurs
in
a
particular
case
it
is
only
because
it
accord
with
the
purpose
or
interest
of
those
managing
the
scheme
.
such
occasional
result
fall
far
short
of
compensating
the
palpable
evil
charged
to
the
account
of
trust
and
monopoly
.
their
tendency
is
to
crush
out
individual
independence
and
to
hinder
or
prevent
the
free
use
of
human
faculty
and
the
full
development
of
human
character
.
through
them
the
farmer
,
the
artisan
,
and
the
small
trader
is
in
danger
of
dislodgment
from
the
proud
position
of
being
his
own
master
,
watchful
of
all
that
touch
his
country
's
prosperity
,
in
which
he
ha
an
individual
lot
,
and
interested
in
all
that
affect
the
advantage
of
business
of
which
he
is
a
factor
,
to
be
relegated
to
the
level
of
a
mere
appurtenance
to
a
great
machine
,
with
little
free
will
,
with
no
duty
but
that
of
passive
obedience
,
and
with
little
hope
or
opportunity
of
rising
in
the
scale
of
responsible
and
helpful
citizenship
.
to
the
instinctive
belief
that
such
is
the
inevitable
trend
of
trust
and
monopoly
is
due
the
widespread
and
deep-seated
popular
aversion
in
which
they
are
held
and
the
not
unreasonable
insistence
that
,
whatever
may
be
their
incidental
economic
advantage
,
their
general
effect
upon
personal
character
,
prospect
,
and
usefulness
can
not
be
otherwise
than
injurious
.
though
congress
ha
attempted
to
deal
with
this
matter
by
legislation
,
the
law
passed
for
that
purpose
thus
far
have
proved
ineffective
,
not
because
of
any
lack
of
disposition
or
attempt
to
enforce
them
,
but
simply
because
the
law
themselves
a
interpreted
by
the
court
do
not
reach
the
difficulty
.
if
the
insufficiency
of
existing
law
can
be
remedied
by
further
legislation
,
it
should
be
done
.
the
fact
must
be
recognized
,
however
,
that
all
federal
legislation
on
this
subject
may
fall
short
of
it
purpose
because
of
inherent
obstacle
and
also
because
of
the
complex
character
of
our
governmental
system
,
which
,
while
making
the
federal
authority
supreme
within
it
sphere
,
ha
carefully
limited
that
sphere
by
mete
and
bound
that
can
not
be
transgressed
.
the
decision
of
our
highest
court
on
this
precise
question
render
it
quite
doubtful
whether
the
evil
of
trust
and
monopoly
can
be
adequately
treated
through
federal
action
unless
they
seek
directly
and
purposely
to
include
in
their
object
transportation
or
intercourse
between
state
or
between
the
united
state
and
foreign
country
.
it
doe
not
follow
,
however
,
that
this
is
the
limit
of
the
remedy
that
may
be
applied
.
even
though
it
may
be
found
that
federal
authority
is
not
broad
enough
to
fully
reach
the
case
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
power
of
the
several
state
to
act
effectively
in
the
premise
,
and
there
should
be
no
reason
to
doubt
their
willingness
to
judiciously
exercise
such
power
.
in
concluding
this
communication
it
last
word
shall
be
an
appeal
to
the
congress
for
the
most
rigid
economy
in
the
expenditure
of
the
money
it
hold
in
trust
for
the
people
.
the
way
to
perplexing
extravagance
is
easy
,
but
a
return
to
frugality
is
difficult
.
when
,
however
,
it
is
considered
that
those
who
bear
the
burden
of
taxation
have
no
guaranty
of
honest
care
save
in
the
fidelity
of
their
public
servant
,
the
duty
of
all
possible
retrenchment
is
plainly
manifest
.
when
our
difference
are
forgotten
and
our
contest
of
political
opinion
are
no
longer
remembered
,
nothing
in
the
retrospect
of
our
public
service
will
be
a
fortunate
and
comforting
a
the
recollection
of
official
duty
well
performed
and
the
memory
of
a
constant
devotion
to
the
interest
of
our
confiding
fellow-countrymen
.
