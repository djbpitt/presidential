fellow
citizen
of
the
united
state
:
in
compliance
with
a
custom
a
old
a
the
government
itself
,
i
appear
before
you
to
address
you
briefly
,
and
to
take
in
your
presence
the
oath
prescribed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
to
be
taken
by
the
president
``
before
he
enters
on
the
execution
of
his
office
.
''
i
do
not
consider
it
necessary
at
present
for
me
to
discus
those
matter
of
administration
about
which
there
is
no
special
anxiety
or
excitement
.
apprehension
seems
to
exist
among
the
people
of
the
southern
state
that
by
the
accession
of
a
republican
administration
their
property
and
their
peace
and
personal
security
are
to
be
endangered
.
there
ha
never
been
any
reasonable
cause
for
such
apprehension
.
indeed
,
the
most
ample
evidence
to
the
contrary
ha
all
the
while
existed
and
been
open
to
their
inspection
.
it
is
found
in
nearly
all
the
published
speech
of
him
who
now
address
you
.
i
do
but
quote
from
one
of
those
speech
when
i
declare
that
``
i
have
no
purpose
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
to
interfere
with
the
institution
of
slavery
in
the
state
where
it
exists
.
i
beheve
i
have
no
lawful
right
to
do
so
,
and
i
have
no
inclination
to
do
so
.
''
those
who
nominated
and
elected
me
did
so
with
full
knowledge
that
i
had
made
this
and
many
similar
declaration
,
and
had
never
recanted
them
.
and
,
more
than
this
,
they
placed
in
the
platform
for
my
acceptance
,
and
a
a
law
to
themselves
and
to
me
,
the
clear
and
emphatic
resolution
which
i
now
read
:
resolved
,
that
the
maintenance
inviolate
of
the
right
of
the
state
,
and
especially
the
right
of
each
state
to
order
and
control
it
own
domestic
institution
according
to
it
own
judgment
exclusively
,
is
essential
to
that
balance
of
power
on
which
the
perfection
and
endurance
of
our
political
fabric
depend
,
and
we
denounce
the
lawless
invasion
by
armed
force
of
the
soil
of
any
state
or
territory
,
no
matter
under
what
pretext
,
a
among
the
gravest
of
crime
.
i
now
reiterate
these
sentiment
;
and
,
in
doing
so
,
i
only
press
upon
the
public
attention
the
most
conclusive
evidence
of
which
the
case
is
susceptible
,
that
the
property
,
peace
,
and
security
of
no
section
are
to
be
in
any
wise
endangered
by
the
now
incoming
administration
.
i
add
,
too
,
that
all
the
protection
which
,
consistently
with
the
constitution
and
the
law
,
can
be
given
,
will
be
cheerfully
given
to
all
the
state
when
lawfully
demanded
,
for
whatever
cause—as
cheerfully
to
one
section
a
to
another
.
there
is
much
controversy
about
the
delivering
up
of
fugitive
from
service
or
labor
.
the
clause
i
now
read
is
a
plainly
written
in
the
constitution
a
any
other
of
it
provision
:
no
person
held
to
service
or
labor
in
one
state
,
under
the
law
thereof
,
escaping
into
another
,
shall
in
consequence
of
any
law
or
regulation
therein
be
discharged
from
such
service
or
labor
,
but
shall
be
delivered
up
on
claim
of
the
party
to
whom
such
service
or
labor
may
be
due
.
it
is
scarcely
questioned
that
this
provision
wa
intended
by
those
who
made
it
for
the
reclaiming
of
what
we
call
fugitive
slave
;
and
the
intention
of
the
lawgiver
is
the
law
.
all
member
of
congress
swear
their
support
to
the
whole
constitution—to
this
provision
a
much
a
to
any
other
.
to
the
proposition
,
then
,
that
slave
whose
case
come
within
the
term
of
this
clause
``
shall
be
delivered
up
,
''
their
oath
are
unanimous
.
now
,
if
they
would
make
the
effort
in
good
temper
,
could
they
not
with
nearly
equal
unanimity
frame
and
pas
a
law
by
mean
of
which
to
keep
good
that
unanimous
oath
?
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
whether
this
clause
should
be
enforced
by
national
or
by
state
authority
;
but
surely
that
difference
is
not
a
very
material
one
.
if
the
slave
is
to
be
surrendered
,
it
can
be
of
but
little
consequence
to
him
or
to
others
by
which
authority
it
is
done
.
and
should
anyone
in
any
case
be
content
that
his
oath
shall
go
unkept
on
a
merely
unsubstantial
controversy
a
to
how
it
shall
be
kept
?
again
,
in
any
law
upon
this
subject
,
ought
not
all
the
safeguard
of
liberty
known
in
civilized
and
humane
jurisprudence
to
be
introduced
,
so
that
a
free
man
be
not
,
in
any
case
,
surrendered
a
a
slave
?
and
might
it
not
be
well
at
the
same
time
to
provide
by
law
for
the
enforcement
of
that
clause
in
the
constitution
which
guarantee
that
``
the
citizen
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privilege
and
immunity
of
citizen
in
the
several
state
.
''
i
take
the
official
oath
to-day
with
no
mental
reservation
,
and
with
no
purpose
to
construe
the
constitution
or
law
by
any
hypercritical
rule
.
and
while
i
do
not
choose
now
to
specify
particular
act
of
congress
a
proper
to
be
enforced
,
i
do
suggest
that
it
will
be
much
safer
for
all
,
both
in
official
and
private
station
,
to
conform
to
and
abide
by
all
those
act
which
stand
unrepealed
,
than
to
violate
any
of
them
,
trusting
to
find
impunity
in
having
them
held
to
be
unconstitutional
.
it
is
seventy-two
year
since
the
first
inauguration
of
a
president
under
our
national
constitution
.
during
that
period
fifteen
different
and
greatly
distinguished
citizen
have
,
in
succession
,
administered
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
.
they
have
conducted
it
through
many
peril
,
and
generally
with
great
success
.
yet
,
with
all
this
scope
of
precedent
,
i
now
enter
upon
the
same
task
for
the
brief
constitutional
term
of
four
year
under
great
and
peculiar
difficulty
.
a
disruption
of
the
federal
union
,
heretofore
only
menaced
,
is
now
formidably
attempted
.
i
hold
that
,
in
contemplation
of
universal
law
and
of
the
constitution
,
the
union
of
these
state
is
perpetual
.
perpetuity
is
implied
,
if
not
expressed
,
in
the
fundamental
law
of
all
national
government
.
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
no
government
proper
ever
had
a
provision
in
it
organic
law
for
it
own
termination
.
continue
to
execute
all
the
express
provision
of
our
national
constitution
,
and
the
union
will
endure
forever—it
being
impossible
to
destroy
it
except
by
some
action
not
provided
for
in
the
instrument
itself
.
again
,
if
the
united
state
be
not
a
government
proper
,
but
an
association
of
state
in
the
nature
of
contract
merely
,
can
it
,
a
a
contract
,
be
peaceably
unmade
by
le
than
all
the
party
who
made
it
?
one
party
to
a
contract
may
violate
it—break
it
,
so
to
speak
;
but
doe
it
not
require
all
to
lawfully
rescind
it
?
descending
from
these
general
principle
,
we
find
the
proposition
that
,
in
legal
contemplation
the
union
is
perpetual
confirmed
by
the
history
of
the
union
itself
.
the
union
is
much
older
than
the
constitution
.
it
wa
formed
,
in
fact
,
by
the
article
of
association
in
1774
.
it
wa
matured
and
continued
by
the
declaration
of
independence
in
1776
.
it
wa
further
matured
,
and
the
faith
of
all
the
then
thirteen
state
expressly
plighted
and
engaged
that
it
should
be
perpetual
,
by
the
article
of
confederation
in
1778
.
and
,
finally
,
in
1787
one
of
the
declared
object
for
ordaining
and
establishing
the
constitution
wa
``
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
.
''
but
if
the
destruction
of
the
union
by
one
or
by
a
part
only
of
the
state
be
lawfully
possible
,
the
union
is
le
perfect
than
before
the
constitution
,
having
lost
the
vital
element
of
perpetuity
.
it
follows
from
these
view
that
no
state
upon
it
own
mere
motion
can
lawfully
get
out
of
the
union
;
that
resolve
and
ordinance
to
that
effect
are
legally
void
;
and
that
act
of
violence
,
within
any
state
or
state
,
against
the
authority
of
the
united
state
,
are
insurrectionary
or
revolutionary
,
according
to
circumstance
.
i
therefore
consider
that
,
in
view
of
the
constitution
and
the
law
,
the
union
is
unbroken
;
and
to
the
extent
of
my
ability
i
shall
take
care
,
a
the
constitution
itself
expressly
enjoins
upon
me
,
that
the
law
of
the
union
be
faithfully
executed
in
all
the
state
.
doing
this
i
deem
to
be
only
a
simple
duty
on
my
part
;
and
i
shall
perform
it
so
far
a
practicable
,
unless
my
rightful
master
,
the
american
people
,
shall
withhold
the
requisite
mean
,
or
in
some
authoritative
manner
direct
the
contrary
.
i
trust
this
will
not
be
regarded
a
a
menace
,
but
only
a
the
declared
purpose
of
the
union
that
it
will
constitutionally
defend
and
maintain
itself
.
in
doing
this
there
need
to
be
no
bloodshed
or
violence
;
and
there
shall
be
none
,
unless
it
be
forced
upon
the
national
authority
.
the
power
confided
to
me
will
be
used
to
hold
,
occupy
,
and
posse
the
property
and
place
belonging
to
the
government
,
and
to
collect
the
duty
and
impost
;
but
beyond
what
may
be
necessary
for
these
object
,
there
will
be
no
invasion
,
no
using
of
force
against
or
among
the
people
anywhere
.
where
hostility
to
the
united
state
,
in
any
interior
locality
,
shall
be
so
great
and
universal
a
to
prevent
competent
resident
citizen
from
holding
the
federal
office
,
there
will
be
no
attempt
to
force
obnoxious
stranger
among
the
people
for
that
object
.
while
the
strict
legal
right
may
exist
in
the
government
to
enforce
the
exercise
of
these
office
,
the
attempt
to
do
so
would
be
so
irritating
,
and
so
nearly
impracticable
withal
,
that
i
deem
it
better
to
forego
for
the
time
the
us
of
such
office
.
the
mail
,
unless
repelled
,
will
continue
to
be
furnished
in
all
part
of
the
union
.
so
far
a
possible
,
the
people
everywhere
shall
have
that
sense
of
perfect
security
which
is
most
favorable
to
calm
thought
and
reflection
.
the
course
here
indicated
will
be
followed
unless
current
event
and
experience
shall
show
a
modification
or
change
to
be
proper
,
and
in
every
case
and
exigency
my
best
discretion
will
be
exercised
according
to
circumstance
actually
existing
,
and
with
a
view
and
a
hope
of
a
peaceful
solution
of
the
national
trouble
and
the
restoration
of
fraternal
sympathy
and
affection
.
that
there
are
person
in
one
section
or
another
who
seek
to
destroy
the
union
at
all
event
,
and
are
glad
of
any
pretext
to
do
it
,
i
will
neither
affirm
nor
deny
;
but
if
there
be
such
,
i
need
address
no
word
to
them
.
to
those
,
however
,
who
really
love
the
union
may
i
not
speak
?
before
entering
upon
so
grave
a
matter
a
the
destruction
of
our
national
fabric
,
with
all
it
benefit
,
it
memory
,
and
it
hope
,
would
it
not
be
wise
to
ascertain
precisely
why
we
do
it
?
will
you
hazard
so
desperate
a
step
while
there
is
any
possibility
that
any
portion
of
the
ill
you
fly
from
have
no
real
existence
?
will
you
,
while
the
certain
ill
you
fly
to
are
greater
than
all
the
real
one
you
fly
from—will
you
risk
the
commission
of
so
fearful
a
mistake
?
all
profess
to
be
content
in
the
union
if
all
constitutional
right
can
be
maintained
.
is
it
true
,
then
,
that
any
right
,
plainly
written
in
the
constitution
,
ha
been
denied
?
i
think
not
.
happily
the
human
mind
is
so
constituted
that
no
party
can
reach
to
the
audacity
of
doing
this
.
think
,
if
you
can
,
of
a
single
instance
in
which
a
plainly
written
provision
of
the
constitution
ha
ever
been
denied
.
if
by
the
mere
force
of
number
a
majority
should
deprive
a
minority
of
any
clearly
written
constitutional
right
,
it
might
,
in
a
moral
point
of
view
,
justify
revolution—certainly
would
if
such
a
right
were
a
vital
one
.
but
such
is
not
our
case
.
all
the
vital
right
of
minority
and
of
individual
are
so
plainly
assured
to
them
by
affirmation
and
negation
,
guarantee
and
prohibition
,
in
the
constitution
,
that
controversy
never
arise
concerning
them
.
but
no
organic
law
can
ever
be
framed
with
a
provision
specifically
applicable
to
every
question
which
may
occur
in
practical
administration
.
no
foresight
can
anticipate
,
nor
any
document
of
reasonable
length
contain
,
express
provision
for
all
possible
question
.
shall
fugitive
from
labor
be
surrendered
by
national
or
by
state
authority
?
the
constitution
doe
not
expressly
say
.
may
congress
prohibit
slavery
in
the
territory
?
the
constitution
doe
not
expressly
say
.
must
congress
protect
slavery
in
the
territory
?
the
constitution
doe
not
expressly
say
.
from
question
of
this
class
spring
all
our
constitutional
controversy
,
and
we
divide
upon
them
into
majority
and
minority
.
if
the
minority
will
not
acquiesce
,
the
majority
must
,
or
the
government
must
cease
.
there
is
no
other
alternative
;
for
continuing
the
government
is
acquiescence
on
one
side
or
the
other
.
if
a
minority
in
such
case
will
secede
rather
than
acquiesce
,
they
make
a
precedent
which
in
turn
will
divide
and
ruin
them
;
for
a
minority
of
their
own
will
secede
from
them
whenever
a
majority
refuse
to
be
controlled
by
such
minority
.
for
instance
,
why
may
not
any
portion
of
a
new
confederacy
a
year
or
two
hence
arbitrarily
secede
again
,
precisely
a
portion
of
the
present
union
now
claim
to
secede
from
it
?
all
who
cherish
disunion
sentiment
are
now
being
educated
to
the
exact
temper
of
doing
this
.
is
there
such
perfect
identity
of
interest
among
the
state
to
compose
a
new
union
,
a
to
produce
harmony
only
,
and
prevent
renewed
secession
?
plainly
,
the
central
idea
of
secession
is
the
essence
of
anarchy
.
a
majority
held
in
restraint
by
constitutional
check
and
limitation
,
and
always
changing
easily
with
deliberate
change
of
popular
opinion
and
sentiment
,
is
the
only
true
sovereign
of
a
free
people
.
whoever
reject
it
doe
,
of
necessity
,
fly
to
anarchy
or
to
despotism
.
unanimity
is
impossible
;
the
rule
of
a
minority
,
a
a
permanent
arrangement
,
is
wholly
inadmissible
;
so
that
,
rejecting
the
majority
principle
,
anarchy
or
despotism
in
some
form
is
all
that
is
left
.
i
do
not
forget
the
position
,
assumed
by
some
,
that
constitutional
question
are
to
be
decided
by
the
supreme
court
;
nor
do
i
deny
that
such
decision
must
be
binding
,
in
any
case
,
upon
the
party
to
a
suit
,
a
to
the
object
of
that
suit
,
while
they
are
also
entitled
to
very
high
respect
and
consideration
in
all
parallel
case
by
all
other
department
of
the
government
.
and
while
it
is
obviously
possible
that
such
decision
may
be
erroneous
in
any
given
case
,
still
the
evil
effect
following
it
,
being
limited
to
that
particular
case
,
with
the
chance
that
it
may
be
overruled
and
never
become
a
precedent
for
other
case
,
can
better
be
borne
than
could
the
evil
of
a
different
practice
.
at
the
same
time
,
the
candid
citizen
must
confess
that
if
the
policy
of
the
government
,
upon
vital
question
affecting
the
whole
people
,
is
to
be
irrevocably
fixed
by
decision
of
the
supreme
court
,
the
instant
they
are
made
,
in
ordinary
litigation
between
party
in
personal
action
,
the
people
will
have
ceased
to
be
their
own
ruler
,
having
to
that
extent
practically
resigned
their
government
into
the
hand
of
that
eminent
tribunal
.
nor
is
there
in
this
view
any
assault
upon
the
court
or
the
judge
.
it
is
a
duty
from
which
they
may
not
shrink
to
decide
case
properly
brought
before
them
,
and
it
is
no
fault
of
theirs
if
others
seek
to
turn
their
decision
to
political
purpose
.
one
section
of
our
country
belief
slavery
is
right
,
and
ought
to
be
extended
,
while
the
other
belief
it
is
wrong
,
and
ought
not
to
be
extended
.
this
is
the
only
substantial
dispute
.
the
fugitive-slave
clause
of
the
constitution
,
and
the
law
for
the
suppression
of
the
foreign
slave-trade
,
are
each
a
well
enforced
,
perhaps
,
a
any
law
can
ever
be
in
a
community
where
the
moral
sense
of
the
people
imperfectly
support
the
law
itself
.
the
great
body
of
the
people
abide
by
the
dry
legal
obligation
in
both
case
,
and
a
few
break
over
in
each
.
this
,
i
think
,
can
not
be
perfectly
cured
;
and
it
would
be
worse
in
both
case
after
the
separation
of
the
section
than
before
.
the
foreign
slave-trade
,
now
imperfectly
suppressed
,
would
be
ultimately
revived
,
without
restriction
,
in
one
section
,
while
fugitive
slave
,
now
only
partially
surrendered
,
would
not
be
surrendered
at
all
by
the
other
.
physically
speaking
,
we
can
not
separate
.
we
can
not
remove
our
respective
section
from
each
other
,
nor
build
an
impassable
wall
between
them
.
a
husband
and
wife
may
be
divorced
,
and
go
out
of
the
presence
and
beyond
the
reach
of
each
other
;
but
the
different
part
of
our
country
can
not
do
this
.
they
can
not
but
remain
face
to
face
,
and
intercourse
,
either
amicable
or
hostile
,
must
continue
between
them
.
is
it
possible
,
then
,
to
make
that
intercourse
more
advantageous
or
more
satisfactory
after
separation
than
before
?
can
alien
make
treaty
easier
than
friend
can
make
law
?
can
treaty
be
more
faithfully
enforced
between
alien
than
law
can
among
friend
?
suppose
you
go
to
war
,
you
can
not
fight
always
;
and
when
,
after
much
loss
on
both
side
,
and
no
gain
on
either
,
you
cease
fighting
,
the
identical
old
question
a
to
term
of
intercourse
are
again
upon
you
.
this
country
,
with
it
institution
,
belongs
to
the
people
who
inhabit
it
.
whenever
they
shall
grow
weary
of
the
existing
government
,
they
can
exercise
their
constitutional
right
of
amending
it
,
or
their
revolutionary
right
to
dismember
or
overthrow
it
.
i
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
many
worthy
and
patriotic
citizen
are
desirous
of
having
the
national
constitution
amended
.
while
i
make
no
recommendation
of
amendment
,
i
fully
recognize
the
rightful
authority
of
the
people
over
the
whole
subject
,
to
be
exercised
in
either
of
the
mode
prescribed
in
the
instrument
itself
;
and
i
should
,
under
existing
circumstance
,
favor
rather
than
oppose
a
fair
opportunity
being
afforded
the
people
to
act
upon
it
.
i
will
venture
to
add
that
to
me
the
convention
mode
seems
preferable
,
in
that
it
allows
amendment
to
originate
with
the
people
themselves
,
instead
of
only
permitting
them
to
take
or
reject
proposition
originated
by
others
not
especially
chosen
for
the
purpose
,
and
which
might
not
be
precisely
such
a
they
would
wish
to
either
accept
or
refuse
.
i
understand
a
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution—which
amendment
,
however
,
i
have
not
seen—has
passed
congress
,
to
the
effect
that
the
federal
government
shall
never
interfere
with
the
domestic
institution
of
the
state
,
including
that
of
person
held
to
service
.
to
avoid
misconstruction
of
what
i
have
said
,
i
depart
from
my
purpose
not
to
speak
of
particular
amendment
so
far
a
to
say
that
,
holding
such
a
provision
to
now
be
implied
constitutional
law
,
i
have
no
objection
to
it
being
made
express
and
irrevocable
.
the
chief
magistrate
derives
all
his
authority
from
the
people
,
and
they
have
conferred
none
upon
him
to
fix
term
for
the
separation
of
the
state
.
the
people
themselves
can
do
this
also
if
they
choose
;
but
the
executive
,
a
such
,
ha
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
his
duty
is
to
administer
the
present
government
,
a
it
came
to
his
hand
,
and
to
transmit
it
,
unimpaired
by
him
,
to
his
successor
.
why
should
there
not
be
a
patient
confidence
in
the
ultimate
justice
of
the
people
?
is
there
any
better
or
equal
hope
in
the
world
?
in
our
present
difference
is
either
party
without
faith
of
being
in
the
right
?
if
the
almighty
ruler
of
nation
,
with
his
eternal
truth
and
justice
,
be
on
your
side
of
the
north
,
or
on
yours
of
the
south
,
that
truth
and
that
justice
will
surely
prevail
by
the
judgment
of
this
great
tribunal
of
the
american
people
.
by
the
frame
of
the
government
under
which
we
live
,
this
same
people
have
wisely
given
their
public
servant
but
little
power
for
mischief
;
and
have
,
with
equal
wisdom
,
provided
for
the
return
of
that
little
to
their
own
hand
at
very
short
interval
.
while
the
people
retain
their
virtue
and
vigilance
,
no
administration
,
by
any
extreme
of
wickedness
or
folly
,
can
very
seriously
injure
the
government
in
the
short
space
of
four
year
.
my
countryman
,
one
and
all
,
think
calmly
and
well
upon
this
whole
subject
.
nothing
valuable
can
be
lost
by
taking
time
.
if
there
be
an
object
to
hurry
any
of
you
in
hot
haste
to
a
step
which
you
would
never
take
deliberately
,
that
object
will
be
frustrated
by
taking
time
;
but
no
good
object
can
be
frustrated
by
it
.
such
of
you
a
are
now
dissatisfied
,
still
have
the
old
constitution
unimpaired
,
and
,
on
the
sensitive
point
,
the
law
of
your
own
framing
under
it
;
while
the
new
administration
will
have
no
immediate
power
,
if
it
would
,
to
change
either
.
if
it
were
admitted
that
you
who
are
dissatisfied
hold
the
right
side
in
the
dispute
,
there
still
is
no
single
good
reason
for
precipitate
action
.
intelligence
,
patriotism
,
christianity
,
and
a
firm
reliance
on
him
who
ha
never
yet
forsaken
this
favored
land
,
are
still
competent
to
adjust
in
the
best
way
all
our
present
difficulty
.
in
your
hand
,
my
dissatisfied
fellow-countrymen
,
and
not
in
mine
,
is
the
momentous
issue
of
civil
war
.
the
government
will
not
assail
you
.
you
can
have
no
conflict
without
being
yourselves
the
aggressor
.
you
have
no
oath
registered
in
heaven
to
destroy
the
government
,
while
i
shall
have
the
most
solemn
one
to
``
preserve
,
protect
,
and
defend
it
.
''
i
am
loath
to
close
.
we
are
not
enemy
,
but
friend
.
we
must
not
be
enemy
.
though
passion
may
have
strained
,
it
must
not
break
our
bond
of
affection
.
the
mystic
chord
of
memory
,
stretching
from
every
battle-field
and
patriot
grave
to
every
living
heart
and
hearthstone
all
over
this
broad
land
,
will
yet
swell
the
chorus
of
the
union
when
again
touched
,
a
surely
they
will
be
,
by
the
better
angel
of
our
nature
.
