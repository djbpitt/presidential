fellow-citizens
:
in
the
presence
of
this
vast
assemblage
of
my
countryman
i
am
aboutto
supplement
and
seal
by
the
oath
which
i
shall
take
the
manifestationof
the
will
of
a
great
and
free
people
.
in
the
exercise
of
their
powerand
right
of
self-government
they
have
committed
to
one
of
their
fellow-citizensa
supreme
and
sacred
trust
,
and
he
here
consecrates
himself
to
their
service
.
this
impressive
ceremony
add
little
to
the
solemn
sense
of
responsibilitywith
which
i
contemplate
the
duty
i
owe
to
all
the
people
of
the
land.nothing
can
relieve
me
from
anxiety
lest
by
any
act
of
mine
their
interestsmay
suffer
,
and
nothing
is
needed
to
strengthen
my
resolution
to
engageevery
faculty
and
effort
in
the
promotion
of
their
welfare
.
amid
the
din
of
party
strife
the
people
's
choice
wa
made
,
but
it
attendantcircumstances
have
demonstrated
anew
the
strength
and
safety
of
a
governmentby
the
people
.
in
each
succeeding
year
it
more
clearly
appears
that
ourdemocratic
principle
need
no
apology
,
and
that
in
it
fearless
and
faithfulapplication
is
to
be
found
the
surest
guaranty
of
good
government
.
but
the
best
result
in
the
operation
of
a
government
wherein
everycitizen
ha
a
share
largely
depend
upon
a
proper
limitation
of
purely
partisanzeal
and
effort
and
a
correct
appreciation
of
the
time
when
the
heat
ofthe
partisan
should
be
merged
in
the
patriotism
of
the
citizen
.
to-day
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
is
transferred
to
newkeeping
.
but
this
is
still
the
government
of
all
the
people
,
and
it
shouldbe
none
the
le
an
object
of
their
affectionate
solicitude
.
at
this
hourthe
animosity
of
political
strife
,
the
bitterness
of
partisan
defeat
,
and
the
exultation
of
partisan
triumph
should
be
supplanted
by
an
ungrudgingacquiescence
in
the
popular
will
and
a
sober
,
conscientious
concern
forthe
general
weal
.
moreover
,
if
from
this
hour
we
cheerfully
and
honestlyabandon
all
sectional
prejudice
and
distrust
,
and
determine
,
with
manlyconfidence
in
one
another
,
to
work
out
harmoniously
the
achievement
ofour
national
destiny
,
we
shall
deserve
to
realize
all
the
benefit
whichour
happy
form
of
government
can
bestow
.
on
this
auspicious
occasion
we
may
well
renew
the
pledge
of
our
devotionto
the
constitution
,
which
,
launched
by
the
founder
of
the
republic
andconsecrated
by
their
prayer
and
patriotic
devotion
,
ha
for
almost
a
centuryborne
the
hope
and
the
aspiration
of
a
great
people
through
prosperityand
peace
and
through
the
shock
of
foreign
conflict
and
the
peril
ofdomestic
strife
and
vicissitude
.
by
the
father
of
his
country
our
constitution
wa
commended
for
adoptionas
``
the
result
of
a
spirit
of
amity
and
mutual
concession
.
''
in
that
samespirit
it
should
be
administered
,
in
order
to
promote
the
lasting
welfareof
the
country
and
to
secure
the
full
measure
of
it
priceless
benefitsto
u
and
to
those
who
will
succeed
to
the
blessing
of
our
national
life.the
large
variety
of
diverse
and
competing
interest
subject
to
federalcontrol
,
persistently
seeking
the
recognition
of
their
claim
,
need
giveus
no
fear
that
``
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
number
''
will
fail
tobe
accomplished
if
in
the
hall
of
national
legislation
that
spirit
ofamity
and
mutual
concession
shall
prevail
in
which
the
constitution
hadits
birth
.
if
this
involves
the
surrender
or
postponement
of
private
interestsand
the
abandonment
of
local
advantage
,
compensation
will
be
found
inthe
assurance
that
the
common
interest
is
subserved
and
the
general
welfareadvanced
.
in
the
discharge
of
my
official
duty
i
shall
endeavor
to
be
guided
bya
just
and
unstrained
construction
of
the
constitution
,
a
careful
observanceof
the
distinction
between
the
power
granted
to
the
federal
governmentand
those
reserved
to
the
state
or
to
the
people
,
and
by
a
cautious
appreciationof
those
function
which
by
the
constitution
and
law
have
been
especiallyassigned
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
.
but
he
who
take
the
oath
today
to
preserve
,
protect
,
and
defend
theconstitution
of
the
united
state
only
assumes
the
solemn
obligation

in

the

uponthe
whole

federal

and
this
is
the
price
of
our
liberty
and
the
inspiration
of

it
is
the
duty
of
those
serving

people
in

place
to
closelylimit
public
expenditure
to
the
actual

andbecause

extravagance

of
the
simplicity

prudential
economy
which
are
bestsuited
to
the
operation
of

republican
