to
the
congress
of
the
united
state
:
your
assembling
is
clouded
by
a
sense
of
public
bereavement
,
caused
by
the
recent
and
sudden
death
of
thomas
a.
hendricks
,
vice-president
of
the
united
state
.
his
distinguished
public
service
,
his
complete
integrity
and
devotion
to
every
duty
,
and
his
personal
virtue
will
find
honorable
record
in
his
country
's
history
.
ample
and
repeated
proof
of
the
esteem
and
confidence
in
which
he
wa
held
by
his
fellow-countrymen
were
manifested
by
his
election
to
office
of
the
most
important
trust
and
highest
dignity
;
and
at
length
,
full
of
year
and
honor
,
he
ha
been
laid
at
rest
amid
universal
sorrow
and
benediction
.
the
constitution
,
which
requires
those
chosen
to
legislate
for
the
people
to
annually
meet
in
the
discharge
of
their
solemn
trust
,
also
requires
the
president
to
give
to
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommend
to
their
consideration
such
measure
a
he
shall
deem
necessary
and
expedient
.
at
the
threshold
of
a
compliance
with
these
constitutional
direction
it
is
well
for
u
to
bear
in
mind
that
our
usefulness
to
the
people
's
interest
will
be
promoted
by
a
constant
appreciation
of
the
scope
and
character
of
our
respective
duty
a
they
relate
to
federal
legislation
.
while
the
executive
may
recommend
such
measure
a
he
shall
deem
expedient
,
the
responsibility
for
legislative
action
must
and
should
rest
upon
those
selected
by
the
people
to
make
their
law
.
contemplation
of
the
grave
and
responsible
function
assigned
to
the
respective
branch
of
the
government
under
the
constitution
will
disclose
the
partition
of
power
between
our
respective
department
and
their
necessary
independence
,
and
also
the
need
for
the
exercise
of
all
the
power
intrusted
to
each
in
that
spirit
of
comity
and
cooperation
which
is
essential
to
the
proper
fulfillment
of
the
patriotic
obligation
which
rest
upon
u
a
faithful
servant
of
the
people
.
the
jealous
watchfulness
of
our
constituency
,
great
and
small
,
supplement
their
suffrage
,
and
before
the
tribunal
they
establish
every
public
servant
should
be
judged
.
it
is
gratifying
to
announce
that
the
relation
of
the
united
state
with
all
foreign
power
continue
to
be
friendly
.
our
position
after
nearly
a
century
of
successful
constitutional
government
,
maintenance
of
good
faith
in
all
our
engagement
,
the
avoidance
of
complication
with
other
nation
,
and
our
consistent
and
amicable
attitude
toward
the
strong
and
weak
alike
furnish
proof
of
a
political
disposition
which
render
profession
of
good
will
unnecessary
.
there
are
no
question
of
difficulty
pending
with
any
foreign
government
.
the
argentine
government
ha
revived
the
long
dormant
question
of
the
falkland
island
by
claiming
from
the
united
state
indemnity
for
their
loss
,
attributed
to
the
action
of
the
commander
of
the
sloop
of
war
lexington
in
breaking
up
a
piratical
colony
on
those
island
in
1831
,
and
their
subsequent
occupation
by
great
britain
.
in
view
of
the
ample
justification
for
the
act
of
the
lexington
and
the
derelict
condition
of
the
island
before
and
after
their
alleged
occupation
by
argentine
colonist
,
this
government
considers
the
claim
a
wholly
groundless
.
question
ha
arisen
with
the
government
of
austria-hungary
touching
the
representation
of
the
united
state
at
vienna
.
having
under
my
constitutional
prerogative
appointed
an
estimable
citizen
of
unimpeached
probity
and
competence
a
minister
at
that
court
,
the
government
of
austria-hungary
invited
this
government
to
take
cognizance
of
certain
exception
,
based
upon
allegation
against
the
personal
acceptability
of
mr.
keiley
,
the
appointed
envoy
,
asking
that
in
view
thereof
the
appointment
should
be
withdrawn
.
the
reason
advanced
were
such
a
could
not
be
acquiesced
in
without
violation
of
my
oath
of
office
and
the
precept
of
the
constitution
,
since
they
necessarily
involved
a
limitation
in
favor
of
a
foreign
government
upon
the
right
of
selection
by
the
executive
and
required
such
an
application
of
a
religious
test
a
a
qualification
for
office
under
the
united
state
a
would
have
resulted
in
the
practical
disfranchisement
of
a
large
class
of
our
citizen
and
the
abandonment
of
a
vital
principle
in
our
government
.
the
austro-hungarian
government
finally
decided
not
to
receive
mr.
keiley
a
the
envoy
of
the
united
state
,
and
that
gentleman
ha
since
resigned
his
commission
,
leaving
the
post
vacant
.
i
have
made
no
new
nomination
,
and
the
interest
of
this
government
at
vienna
are
now
in
the
care
of
the
secretary
of
legation
,
acting
a
charge

early
in
march
last
war
broke
out
in
central
america
,
caused
by
the
attempt
of
guatemala
to
consolidate
the
several
state
into
a
single
government
.
in
these
contest
between
our
neighboring
state
the
united
state
forebore
to
interfere
actively
,
but
lent
the
aid
of
their
friendly
office
in
deprecation
of
war
and
to
promote
peace
and
concord
among
the
belligerent
,
and
by
such
counsel
contributed
importantly
to
the
restoration
of
tranquillity
in
that
locality
.
emergency
growing
out
of
civil
war
in
the
united
state
of
colombia
demanded
of
the
government
at
the
beginning
of
this
administration
the
employment
of
armed
force
to
fulfill
it
guaranty
under
the
thirty-fifth
article
of
the
treaty
of
1846
,
in
order
to
keep
the
transit
open
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
.
desirous
of
exercising
only
the
power
expressly
reserved
to
u
by
the
treaty
,
and
mindful
of
the
right
of
colombia
,
the
force
sent
to
the
isthmus
were
instructed
to
confine
their
action
to
``
positively
and
efficaciously
''
preventing
the
transit
and
it
accessory
from
being
``
interrupted
or
embarrassed
.
''
the
execution
of
this
delicate
and
responsible
task
necessarily
involved
police
control
where
the
local
authority
wa
temporarily
powerless
,
but
always
in
aid
of
the
sovereignty
of
colombia
.
the
prompt
and
successful
fulfillment
of
it
duty
by
this
government
wa
highly
appreciated
by
the
government
of
colombia
,
and
ha
been
followed
by
expression
of
it
satisfaction
.
high
praise
is
due
to
the
officer
and
men
engaged
in
this
service
.
the
restoration
of
peace
on
the
isthmus
by
the
reestablishment
of
the
constituted
government
there
being
thus
accomplished
,
the
force
of
the
united
state
were
withdrawn
.
pending
these
occurrence
a
question
of
much
importance
wa
presented
by
decree
of
the
colombian
government
proclaiming
the
closure
of
certain
port
then
in
the
hand
of
insurgent
and
declaring
vessel
held
by
the
revolutionist
to
be
piratical
and
liable
to
capture
by
any
power
.
to
neither
of
these
proposition
could
the
united
state
assent
.
an
effective
closure
of
port
not
in
the
possession
of
the
government
,
but
held
by
hostile
partisan
,
could
not
be
recognized
;
neither
could
the
vessel
of
insurgent
against
the
legitimate
sovereignty
be
deemed
hostes
humani
generis
within
the
precept
of
international
law
,
whatever
might
be
the
definition
and
penalty
of
their
act
under
the
municipal
law
of
the
state
against
whose
authority
they
were
in
revolt
.
the
denial
by
this
government
of
the
colombian
proposition
did
not
,
however
,
imply
the
admission
of
a
belligerent
status
on
the
part
of
the
insurgent
.
the
colombian
government
ha
expressed
it
willingness
to
negotiate
convention
for
the
adjustment
by
arbitration
of
claim
by
foreign
citizen
arising
out
of
the
destruction
of
the
city
of
aspinwall
by
the
insurrectionary
force
.
the
interest
of
the
united
state
in
a
practicable
transit
for
ship
across
the
strip
of
land
separating
the
atlantic
from
the
pacific
ha
been
repeatedly
manifested
during
the
last
half
century
.
my
immediate
predecessor
caused
to
be
negotiated
with
nicaragua
a
treaty
for
the
construction
,
by
and
at
the
sole
cost
of
the
united
state
,
of
a
canal
through
nicaraguan
territory
,
and
laid
it
before
the
senate
.
pending
the
action
of
that
body
thereon
,
i
withdrew
the
treaty
for
reexamination
.
attentive
consideration
of
it
provision
lead
me
to
withhold
it
from
resubmission
to
the
senate
.
maintaining
,
a
i
do
,
the
tenet
of
a
line
of
precedent
from
washington
's
day
,
which
proscribe
entangling
alliance
with
foreign
state
,
i
do
not
favor
a
policy
of
acquisition
of
new
and
distant
territory
or
the
incorporation
of
remote
interest
with
our
own
.
the
law
of
progress
are
vital
and
organic
,
and
we
must
be
conscious
of
that
irresistible
tide
of
commercial
expansion
which
,
a
the
concomitant
of
our
active
civilization
,
day
by
day
is
being
urged
onward
by
those
increasing
facility
of
production
,
transportation
,
and
communication
to
which
steam
and
electricity
have
given
birth
;
but
our
duty
in
the
present
instructs
u
to
address
ourselves
mainly
to
the
development
of
the
vast
resource
of
the
great
area
committed
to
our
charge
and
to
the
cultivation
of
the
art
of
peace
within
our
own
border
,
though
jealously
alert
in
preventing
the
american
hemisphere
from
being
involved
in
the
political
problem
and
complication
of
distant
government
.
therefore
i
am
unable
to
recommend
proposition
involving
.
paramount
privilege
of
ownership
or
right
outside
of
our
own
territory
,
when
coupled
with
absolute
and
unlimited
engagement
to
defend
the
territorial
integrity
of
the
state
where
such
interest
lie
.
while
the
general
project
of
connecting
the
two
ocean
by
mean
of
a
canal
is
to
be
encouraged
,
i
am
of
opinion
that
any
scheme
to
that
end
to
be
considered
with
favor
should
be
free
from
the
feature
alluded
to
.
the
tehuantepec
route
is
declared
by
engineer
of
the
highest
repute
and
by
competent
scientist
to
afford
an
entirely
practicable
transit
for
vessel
and
cargo
,
by
mean
of
a
ship
railway
,
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
.
the
obvious
advantage
of
such
a
route
,
if
feasible
,
over
others
more
remote
from
the
axial
line
of
traffic
between
europe
and
the
pacific
,
and
particularly
between
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
the
western
coast
of
north
and
south
america
,
are
deserving
of
consideration
.
whatever
highway
may
be
constructed
across
the
barrier
dividing
the
two
greatest
maritime
area
of
the
world
must
be
for
the
world
's
benefit
--
a
trust
for
mankind
,
to
be
removed
from
the
chance
of
domination
by
any
single
power
,
nor
become
a
point
of
invitation
for
hostility
or
a
prize
for
warlike
ambition
.
an
engagement
combining
the
construction
,
ownership
,
and
operation
of
such
a
work
by
this
government
,
with
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
for
it
protection
,
with
the
foreign
state
whose
responsibility
and
right
we
would
share
is
,
in
my
judgment
,
inconsistent
with
such
dedication
to
universal
and
neutral
use
,
and
would
,
moreover
,
entail
measure
for
it
realization
beyond
the
scope
of
our
national
polity
or
present
mean
.
the
lapse
of
year
ha
abundantly
confirmed
the
wisdom
and
foresight
of
those
earlier
administration
which
,
long
before
the
condition
of
maritime
intercourse
were
changed
and
enlarged
by
the
progress
of
the
age
,
proclaimed
the
vital
need
of
interoceanic
transit
across
the
american
isthmus
and
consecrated
it
in
advance
to
the
common
use
of
mankind
by
their
positive
declaration
and
through
the
formal
obligation
of
treaty
.
toward
such
realization
the
effort
of
my
administration
will
be
applied
,
ever
bearing
in
mind
the
principle
on
which
it
must
rest
,
and
which
were
declared
in
no
uncertain
tone
by
mr.
ca
,
who
,
while
secretary
of
state
,
in
1858
,
announced
that
``
what
the
united
state
want
in
central
america
,
next
to
the
happiness
of
it
people
,
is
the
security
and
neutrality
of
the
interoceanic
route
which
lead
through
it
.
''
the
construction
of

transcontinental
line
of
railway
,
all
in
successful
operation
,
wholly
within
our
territory
,
and
uniting
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
ocean
,
ha
been
accompanied
by
result
of
a
most
interesting
and
impressive
nature
,
and
ha
created
new
condition
,
not
in
the
route
of
commerce
only
,
but
in
political
geography
,
which
powerfully
affect
our
relation
toward
and
necessarily
increase
our
interest
in
any
transisthmian
route
which
may
be
opened
and
employed
for
the
end
of
peace
and
traffic
,
or
,
in
other
contingency

for
us
inimical
to
both
.
transportation
is
a
factor
in
the
cost
of
commodity
scarcely
second
to
that
of
their
production
,
and
weighs
a
heavily
upon
the
consumer
.
our
experience
already
ha
proven
the
great
importance
of
having
the
competition
between
land
carriage
and
water
carriage
fully
developed
,
each
acting
a
a
protection
to
the
public
against
the
tendency
to
monopoly
which
are
inherent
in
the
consolidation
of
wealth
and
power
in
the
hand
of
vast
corporation
.
these
suggestion
may
serve
to
emphasize
what
i
have
already
said
on
the
score
of
the
necessity
of
a
neutralization
of
any
interoceanic
transit
;
and
this
can
only
be
accomplished
by
making
the
us
of
the
route
open
to
all
nation
and
subject
to
the
ambition
and
warlike
necessity
of
none
.
the
drawing
and
report
of
a
recent
survey
of
the
nicaragua
canal
route
,
made
by

be
communicated
for
your
information
.

claim
of

the
harmony
of
our
relation
with

is
fully
sustained
.
in
the
application
of
the
act
lately
passed
to
execute
the
treaty
of
1880
,
restrictive
of
the
immigration
of
chinese
laborer

,
individual
case
of
hardship
have
occurred
beyond
the
power
of
the

to
remedy
,
and
calling
for
judicial
determination
.
the
condition
of
the
chinese
question
in
the
western
state
and
territory
is
,
despite
this
restrictive
legislation
,
far
from
being
satisfactory
.
the
recent
outbreak
in
wyoming
territory
,
where
number
of
unoffending
chinaman
,
indisputably
within
the
protection
of
the
treaty
and
the
law
,
were
murdered
by
a
mob
,
and
the
still
more
recent
threatened
outbreak
of
the
same
character
in
washington
territory
,
are
fresh
in
the
mind
of
all
,
and
there
is
apprehension
lest
the
bitterness
of
feeling
against
the
mongolian
race
on
the
pacific
slope
may
find
vent
in
similar
lawless
demonstration
.
all
the
power
of
this
government
should
be
exerted
to
maintain
the
amplest
good
faith
toward
china
in
the
treatment
of
these
men
,
and
the
inflexible
sternness
of
the
law
in
bringing
the
wrongdoer
to
justice
should
be
insisted
upon
.
every
effort
ha
been
made
by
this
government
to
prevent
these
violent
outbreak
and
to
aid
the
representative
of
china
in
their
investigation
of
these
outrage
;
and
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
they
are
traceable
to
the
lawlessness
of
men
not
citizen
of
the
united
state
engaged
in
competition
with
chinese
laborer
.
race
prejudice
is
the
chief
factor
in
originating
these
disturbance
,
and
it
exists
in
a
large
part
of
our
domain
,
jeopardizing
our
domestic
peace
and
the
good
relationship
we
strive
to
maintain
with
china
.
the
admitted
right
of
a
government
to
prevent
the
influx
of
element
hostile
to
it
internal
peace
and
security
may
not
be
questioned
,
even
where
there
is
no
treaty
stipulation
on
the
subject
.
that
the
exclusion
of
chinese
labor
is
demanded
in
other
country
where
like
condition
prevail
is
strongly
evidenced
in
the
dominion
of
canada
,
where
chinese
immigration
is
now
regulated
by
law
more
exclusive
than
our
own
.
if
existing
law
are
inadequate
to
compass
the
end
in

i
shall
be
prepared

give
earnest
consideration

the
independent
state
of
the
kongo
ha
been
organized
a
a
government
under
the
sovereignty
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
the
belgian
,
who
assumes
it
chief
magistracy
in
his
personal
character
only
,
without
making
the
new
state
a
dependency
of
belgium

it
is
fortunate
that
a
benighted
region
,
owing
all
it
ha
of
quickening
civilization
to
the
beneficence
and
philanthropic
spirit
of
this
monarch
,
should
have
the
advantage
and
security
of
his
benevolent
supervision
.
the
action
taken
by
this
government
last
year
in
being
the
first
to
recognize
the
flag
of
the
international
association
of

been
followed
by
formal
recognition
of

succeeds

delegate
attended
on
behalf
of
the
united
state
on
the
understanding
that
their
part
should
be
merely
deliberative
,
without
imparting
to
the
result
any
binding
character
so
far
a
the
united
state
were
concerned
.
this
reserve
wa
due
to
the
indisposition
of
this
government
to
share
in
any
disposal
by
an
international
congress
of
jurisdictional
question
in
remote
foreign
territory
.
the
result
of
the
conference
were
embodied
in
a
formal
act
of
the
nature
of
an
international
convention
,
which
laid
down
certain
obligation
purporting
to
be
binding
on
the
signatory
,
subject
to
ratification
within
one
year
.
notwithstanding
the
reservation
under
which
the
delegate
of
the
united
state
attended
,
their
signature
were
attached
to
the
general
act
in
the
same
manner
a
those
of
the
plenipotentiary
of
other
government
,
thus
making
the
united
state
appear
,
without
reserve
or
qualification
,
a
signatory
to
a
joint
international
engagement
imposing
on
the
signer
the
conservation
of
the
territorial
integrity
of
distant
region
where
we
have
no
established
interest
or
control
.
this
government
doe
not
,
however
,
regard
it
reservation
of
liberty
of
action
in
the
premise
a
at
all
impaired
;
and
holding
that
an
engagement
to
share
in
the
obligation
of
enforcing
neutrality
in
the
remote
valley
of
the
kongo
would
be
an
alliance
whose
responsibility
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
assume
,
i
abstain
from
asking
the
sanction
of
the
senate
to
that
general
act
.
the
correspondence
will
be
laid
before
you
,
and
the
instructive
and
interesting
report
of
the
agent
sent
by
this
government
to
the
kongo
country
and
his
recommendation
for
the
establishment
of

american
country

report
on
the
method

enlarging

commercial
relation
of

ha
submitted
report
,
which
will
be
laid
before

no
opportunity
ha
been
omitted
to
testify
the
friendliness
of
this
government
toward
korea
,
whose
entrance
into
the
family
of
treaty
power
the
united
state
were
the
first
to
recognize
.
i
regard
with
favor
the
application
made
by
the
korean
government
to
be
allowed
to
employ
american
officer
a
military
instructor
,
to
which
the
assent
of
congress
becomes
necessary
,
and
i
am
happy
to
say
this
request
ha
the
concurrent
sanction
of
china

the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
julio
r.
santos
,
a
citizen
of
the
united
state
,
by
the
authority
of
ecuador
gave
rise
to
a
contention
with
that
government
,
in
which
his
right
to
be
released
or
to
have
a
speedy
and
impartial
trial
on
announced
charge
and
with
all
guaranty
of
defense
stipulated
by
treaty
wa
insisted
upon
by
u
.
after
an
elaborate
correspondence
and
repeated
and
earnest
representation
on
our
part
mr.
santos
wa
,
after
an
alleged
trial
and
conviction
,
eventually
included
in
a
general
decree
of
amnesty
and
pardoned
by
the
ecuadorian
executive
and
released
,
leaving
the
question
of
his
american
citizenship
denied
by
the
ecuadorian
government
,
but
insisted
upon
by
our
own
.
the
amount
adjudged
by
the
late
french
and
american
claim
commission
to
be
due
from
the
united
state
to
french
claimant
on
account
of
injury
suffered
by
them
during
the
war
of
secession
,
having
been
appropriated
by
the
last
congress
,

been
duly
paid
to
the
french
government
.
the
act
of
february
25
,
1885
,
provided
for
a
preliminary
search
of
the
record
of
french
prize
court
for
evidence
bearing
on
the
claim
of
american
citizen
against
france
for
spoliation
committed
prior
to
1801
.
the
duty
ha
been
performed
,
and
the
report
of
the
agent
will
be
laid
before
you
.
i
regret
to
say
that
the
restriction
upon
the
importation
of
our
pork
into
france
continue
,
notwithstanding
the
abundant
demonstration
of
the
absence
of
sanitary
danger
in
it
use
;
but
i
entertain
strong
hope
that
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
matter
this
vexatious
prohibition
will
be
removed
.
it
would
be
pleasing
to
be
able
to
say
a
much
with
respect
to
germany
,
austria
,
and
other
country
,
where
such
food
product
are
absolutely
excluded
,
without
present
prospect
of
reasonable
change
.
the
interpretation
of
our
existing
treaty
of
naturalization
by
germany
during
the
past
year
ha
attracted
attention
by
reason
of
an
apparent
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
imperial
government
to
extend
the
scope
of
the
residential
restriction
to
which
returning
naturalized
citizen
of
german
origin
are
asserted
to
be
liable
under
the
law
of
the
empire
.
the
temperate
and
just
attitude
taken
by
this
government
with
regard
to
this
class
of
question
will
doubtless
lead
to
a
satisfactory
understanding
.
the
dispute
of
germany
and
spain
relative
to
the
domination
of
the
caroline
island
ha
attracted
the
attention
of
this
government
by
reason
of
extensive
interest
of
american
citizen
having
grown
up
in
those
part
during
the
past
thirty
year
,
and
because
the
question
of
ownership
involves
jurisdiction
of
matter
affecting
the
status
of
our
citizen
under
civil
and
criminal
law
.
while
standing
wholly
aloof
from
the
proprietary
issue
raised
between
power
to
both
of
which
the
united
state
are
friendly
,
this
government
expects
that
nothing
in
the
present
contention
shall
unfavorably
affect
our
citizen
carrying
on
a
peaceful
commerce
or
there
domiciled
,
and
ha
so
informed
the
government
of
spain
and
germany
.
the
marked
good
will
between
the
united
state
and
great
britain
ha
been
maintained
during
the
past
year
.
the
termination
of
the
fishing
clause
of
the
treaty
of
washington
,
in
pursuance
of
the
joint
resolution
of
march
3
,
1883
,
must
have
resulted
in
the
abrupt
cessation
on
the
1st
of
july
of
this
year
,
in
the
midst
of
their
venture
,
of
the
operation
of
citizen
of
the
united
state
engaged
in
fishing
in
british
american
water
but
for
a
diplomatic
understanding
reached
with
her
majesty
's
government
in
june
last
,
whereby
assurance
wa
obtained
that
no
interruption
of
those
operation
should
take
place
during
the
current
fishing
season
.
in
the
interest
of
good
neighborhood
and
of
the
commercial
intercourse
of
adjacent
community
,
the
question
of
the
north
american
fishery
is
one
of
much
importance
.
following
out
the
intimation
given
by
me
when
the
extensory
arrangement
above
described
wa
negotiated
,
i
recommend
that
the
congress
provide
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
in
which
the
government
of
the
united
state
and
great
britain
shall
be
respectively
represented
,
charged
with
the
consideration
and
settlement
,
upon
a
just
,
equitable
,
and
honorable
basis
,
of
the
entire
question
of
the
fishing
right
of
the
two
government
and
their
respective
citizen
on
the
coast
of
the
united
state
and
british
north
america
.
the
fishing
interest
being
intimately
related
to
other
general
question
dependent
upon
contiguity
and
intercourse
,
consideration
thereof
in
all
their
equity
might
also
properly
come
within
the
purview
of
such
a
commission
,
and
the
fullest
latitude
of
expression
on
both
side
should
be
permitted
.
the
correspondence
in
relation
to
the
fishing
right
will
be
submitted

,
wa
,
after
the
successful
attainment
of
that
humane
purpose
,
returned
to
great
britain
,
in
pursuance
of
the
authority
conferred
by
the
act

.
the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
engagement
for
extradition
between
the
united
state
and
great
britain
ha
been
long
apparent
.
the
tenth
article
of
the
treaty
of
1842
,

of
the
earliest
compact
in
this
regard
entered
into
by
u
,

for
surrender
in
respect
of
a
limited
number
of
offense
.
other
crime
no
le
inimical
to
the
social
welfare
should
be
embraced
and
the
procedure
of
extradition
brought
in
harmony
with

international
practice
.

with
her
majesty
's
government
for
an
enlarged
treaty
of
extradition

been

since

and
i
entertain
strong
hope
that
a
satisfactory
result
may
be
soon
attained

the
frontier
line
between
alaska
and

,

defined
by
the
treaty
of
cession
with
russia
,

the
demarcation
assigned
in
a
prior
treaty
between
great
britain
and
russia
.
modern
exploration
discloses
that
this
ancient
boundary
is
impracticable
a
a
geographical
fact
.
in
the
unsettled
condition
of
that
region
the
question
ha
lacked
importance
,
but
the
discovery
of
mineral
wealth
in
the
territory
the
line
is
supposed
to
traverse
admonishes
that
the
time
ha
come
when
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
boundary
is
needful
to
avert
jurisdictional
complication
.
i
recommend
,
therefore
,
that
provision
be
made
for
a
preliminary
reconnoissance
by
officer
of
the
united
state
,
to
the
end
of
acquiring
more
precise
information
on
the
subject
.
i
have
invited
her
majesty
's
government
to
consider
with
u
the
adoption
of
a
more
convenient
line
,
to
be
established
by
meridian
observation
or
by
known
geographical
feature
without
the
necessity
of
an
expensive
survey
of
the
whole
.
the
late
insurrectionary
movement
in
hayti
having
been
quelled
,
the
government
of
that
republic
ha
made
prompt
provision
for
adjudicating
the
loss
suffered
by
foreigner
because
of
hostility
there
,
and
the
claim
of
certain
citizen
of
the
united
state
will
be
in
this
manner
determined
.
the
long-pending
claim
of
two
citizen
of
the
united
state
,
pelletier
and
lazare
,
have
been
disposed
of
by
arbitration
,
and
an
award
in
favor
of
each
claimant
ha
been
made
,
which
by
the
term
of
the
engagement
is
final
.
it
remains
for
congress
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
the
stipulated
moiety
of
the
expense
.
a
question
arose
with
hayti
during
the
past
year
by
reason
of
the
exceptional
treatment
of
an
american
citizen
,
mr.
van
bokkelen
,
a
resident
of
port-au-prince
,
who
,
on
suit
by
creditor
residing
in
the
united
state
,
wa
sentenced
to
imprisonment
,
and
,
under
the
operation
of
a
haytian
statute
,
wa
denied
relief
secured
to
a
native
haytian
.
this
government
asserted
his
treaty
right
to
equal
treatment
with
native
of
hayti
in
all
suit
at
law
.
our
contention
wa
denied
by
the
haytian
government
,
which
,
however
,
while
still
professing
to
maintain
the
ground
taken
against
mr.
van
bokkelen
's
right
,
terminated
the
controversy
by
setting
him
at
liberty
without
explanation

been
unavoidably
delayed
,

i
apprehend
no
difficulty
in
securing
a
prolongation
of
the
period
for
it
accomplishment

lately
concluded

awaits
the
stipulated

additional
time

been
secured

action
is
certainly
desirable
to
effect
the
object
in
view
;
and
while
there
may
be
question
a
to
the
relative
advantage
of
treating
it
by
legislation
or
by
specific
treaty
,
the
matured
view
of
the
berne
conference
can
not
fail
to
aid
your
consideration
of
the
subject
.
the
termination
of
the
commercial
treaty
of
1862
between
the
united
state
and
turkey
ha
been
sought
by
that
government
.
while
there
is
question
a
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
notice
of
termination
given
,
yet
a
the
commercial
right
of
our
citizen
in
turkey
come
under
the
favored-nation
guaranty
of
the
prior
treaty
of
1830
,
and
a
equal
treatment
is
admitted
by
the
porte
,
no
inconvenience
can
result
from
the
assent
of
this
government
to
the
revision
of
the
ottoman
tariff
,
in
which
the
treaty
power
have
been
invited
to
join
.
question
concerning
our
citizen
in
turkey
may
be
affected
by
the
porte's
nonacquiescence
in
the
right
of
expatriation
and
by
the
imposition
of
religious
test
a
a
condition
of
residence
,
in
which
this
government
can
not
concur
.
the
united
state
must
hold
in
their
intercourse
with
every
power
that
the
status
of
their
citizen
is
to
be
respected
and
equal
civil
privilege
accorded
to
them
without
regard
to
creed
,
and
affected
by
no
consideration
save
those
growing
out
of
domiciliary
return
to
the
land
of
original
allegiance
or
of
unfulfilled
personal
obligation
which
may
survive
,
under
municipal
law
,
after
such
voluntary
return
.
the
negotiation
with
venezuela
relative
to
the
rehearing
of
the
award
of
the
mixed
commission
constituted
under
the
treaty
of
1866
wa
resumed
in
view
of
the
recent
acquiescence
of
the
venezuelan
envoy
in
the
principal
point
advanced
by
this
government
,
that
the
effect
of
the
old
treaty
could
only
be
set
aside
by
the
operation
of
a
new
convention
.
a
result
in
substantial
accord
with
the
advisory
suggestion
contained
in
the
joint
resolution
of
march
3
,
1883
,
ha
been
agreed
upon
and
will
shortly
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
.
under
section
3659
of
the
revised
statute
all
fund
held
in
trust
by
the
united
state
and
the
annual
interest
accruing
thereon
,
when
not
otherwise
required
by
treaty
,
are
to
be
invested
in
stock
of
the
united
state
bearing
a
rate
of
interest
not
le
than
5
per
cent
per
annum
.
there
being
now
no
procurable
stock
paying
so
high
a
rate
of
interest
,
the
letter
of
the
statute
is
at
present
inapplicable
,
but
it
spirit
is
subserved
by
continuing
to
make
investment
of
this
nature
in
current
stock
bearing
the
highest
interest
now
paid
.
the
statute
,
however
,
make
no
provision
for
the
disposal
of
such
accretion
.
it
being
contrary
to
the
general
rule
of
this
government
to
allow
interest
on
claim
,
i
recommend
the
repeal
of
the
provision
in
question
and
the
disposition
,
under
a
uniform
rule
,
of
the
present
accumulation
from
investment
of
trust
fund
.
the
inadequacy
of
existing
legislation
touching
citizenship
and
naturalization
demand
your
consideration
.
while
recognizing
the
right
of
expatriation
,
no
statutory
provision
exists
providing
mean
for
renouncing
citizenship
by
an
american
citizen
,
native
born
or
naturalized
,
nor
for
terminating
and
vacating
an
improper
acquisition
of
citizenship
.
even
a
fraudulent
decree
of
naturalization
can
not
now
be
canceled
.
the
privilege
and
franchise
of
american
citizenship
should
be
granted
with
care
,
and
extended
to
those
only
who
intend
in
good
faith
to
assume
it
duty
and
responsibility
when
attaining
it
privilege
and
benefit
.
it
should
be
withheld
from
those
who
merely
go
through
the
form
of
naturalization
with
the
intent
of
escaping
the
duty
of
their
original
allegiance
without
taking
upon
themselves
those
of
their
new
status
,
or
who
may
acquire
the
right
of
american
citizenship
for
no
other
than
a
hostile
purpose
toward
their
original
government
.
these
evil
have
had
many
flagrant
illustration
.
i
regard
with
favor
the
suggestion
put
forth
by
one
of
my
predecessor
that
provision
be
made
for
a
central
bureau
of
record
of
the
decree
of
naturalization
granted
by
the
various
court
throughout
the
united
state
now
invested
with
that
power
.
the
right
which
spring
from
domicile
in
the
united
state
,
especially
when
coupled
with
a
declaration
of
intention
to
become
a
citizen
,
are
worthy
of
definition
by
statute
.
the
stranger
coming
hither
with
intent
to
remain
,
establishing
his
residence
in
our
midst
,
contributing
to
the
general
welfare
,
and
by
his
voluntary
act
declaring
his
purpose
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
citizenship
,
thereby
gain
an
inchoate
status
which
legislation
may
properly
define
.
the
law
of
certain
state
and
territory
admit
a
domiciled
alien
to
the
local
franchise
,
conferring
on
him
the
right
of
citizenship
to
a
degree
which
place
him
in
the
anomalous
position
of
being
a
citizen
of
a
state
and
yet
not
of
the
united
state
within
the
purview
of
federal
and
international
law
.
it
is
important
within
the
scope
of
national
legislation
to
define
this
right
of
alien
domicile
a
distinguished
from
federal
naturalization
.
the
commercial
relation
of
the
united
state
with
their
immediate
neighbor
and
with
important
area
of
traffic
near
our
shore
suggest
especially
liberal
intercourse
between
them
and
u
.
following
the
treaty
of
1883
with
mexico
,
which
rested
on
the
basis
of
a
reciprocal
exemption
from
custom
duty
,
other
similar
treaty
were
initiated
by
my
predecessor
.
recognizing
the
need
of
le
obstructed
traffic
with
cuba
and
puerto
rico
,
and
met
by
the
desire
of
spain
to
succor
languishing
interest
in
the
antilles
,
step
were
taken
to
attain
those
end
by
a
treaty
of
commerce
.
a
similar
treaty
wa
afterwards
signed
by
the
dominican
republic
.
subsequently
overture
were
made
by
her
britannic
majesty's
government
for
a
like
mutual
extension
of
commercial
intercourse
with
the
british
west
indian
and
south
american
dependency
,
but
without
result
.
on
taking
office
i
withdrew
for
reexamination
the
treaty
signed
with
spain
and
santo
domingo
,
then
pending
before
the
senate
.
the
result
ha
been
to
satisfy
me
of
the
inexpediency
of
entering
into
engagement
of
this
character
not
covering
the
entire
traffic
.
these
treaty
contemplated
the
surrender
by
the
united
state
of
large
revenue
for
inadequate
consideration
.
upon
sugar
alone
duty
were
surrendered
to
an
amount
far
exceeding
all
the
advantage
offered
in
exchange
.
even
were
it
intended
to
relieve
our
consumer
,
it
wa
evident
that
so
long
a
the
exemption
but
partially
covered
our
importation
such
relief
would
be
illusory
.
to
relinquish
a
revenue
so
essential
seemed
highly
improvident
at
a
time
when
new
and
large
drain
upon
the
treasury
were
contemplated
.
moreover
,
embarrassing
question
would
have
arisen
under
the
favored-nation
clause
of
treaty
with
other
nation
.
a
a
further
objection
,
it
is
evident
that
tariff
regulation
by
treaty
diminishes
that
independent
control
over
it
own
revenue
which
is
essential
for
the
safety
and
welfare
of
any
government
.
emergency
calling
for
an
increase
of
taxation
may
at
any
time
arise
,
and
no
engagement
with
a
foreign
power
should
exist
to
hamper
the
action
of
the
government
.
by
the
fourteenth
section
of
the
shipping
act
approved
june
26
,
1884
,
certain
reduction
and
contingent
exemption
from
tonnage
due
were
made
a
to
vessel
entering
port
of
the
united
state
from
any
foreign
port
in
north
and
central
america
,
the
west
india
island
,
the
bahamas
and
bermuda
,
mexico
,
and
the
isthmus
a
far
a
aspinwall
and
panama
.
the
government
of
belgium
,
denmark
,
germany
,
portugal
,
and
sweden
and
norway
have
asserted
,
under
the
favored-nation
clause
in
their
treaty
with
the
united
state
,
a
claim
to
like
treatment
in
respect
of
vessel
coming
to
the
united
state
from
their
home
port
.
this
government
,
however
,
hold
that
the
privilege
granted
by
the
act
are
purely
geographical
,
inuring
to
any
vessel
of
any
foreign
power
that
may
choose
to
engage
in
traffic
between
this
country
and
any
port
within
the
defined
zone
,
and
no
warrant
exists
under
the
most-favored-nation
clause
for
the
extension
of
the
privilege
in
question
to
vessel
sailing
to
this
country
from
port
outside
the
limitation
of
the
act
.
undoubtedly
the
relation
of
commerce
with
our
near
neighbor
,
whose
territory
form
so
long
a
frontier
line
difficult
to
be
guarded
,
and
who
find
in
our
country
,
and
equally
offer
to
u
,
natural
market
,
demand
special
and
considerate
treatment
.
it
rest
with
congress
to
consider
what
legislative
action
may
increase
facility
of
intercourse
which
contiguity
make
natural
and
desirable
.
i
earnestly
urge
that
congress
recast
the
appropriation
for
the
maintenance
of
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
on
a
footing
commensurate
with
the
importance
of
our
national
interest
.
at
every
post
where
a
representative
is
necessary
the
salary
should
be
so
graded
a
to
permit
him
to
live
with
comfort
.
with
the
assignment
of
adequate
salary
the
so-called
notarial
extra
official
fee
,
which
our
officer
abroad
are
now
permitted
to
treat
a
personal
perquisite
,
should
be
done
away
with
.
every
act
requiring
the
certification
and
seal
of
the
officer
should
be
taxable
at
schedule
rate
and
the
fee
therefor
returned
to
the
treasury
.
by
restoring
these
revenue
to
the
public
use
the
consular
service
would
be
self-supporting
,
even
with
a
liberal
increase
of
the
present
low
salary
.
in
further
prevention
of
abuse
a
system
of
consular
inspection
should
be
instituted
.
the
appointment
of
a
limited
number
of
secretary
of
legation
at
large
,
to
be
assigned
to
duty
wherever
necessary
,
and
in
particular
for
temporary
service
at
mission
which
for
any
cause
may
be
without
a
head
,
should
also
be
authorized
.
i
favor
also
authorization
for
the
detail
of
officer
of
the
regular
service
a
military
or
naval
attache
at
legation
.
some
foreign
government
do
not
recognize
the
union
of
consular
with
diplomatic
function
.
italy
and
venezuela
will
only
receive
the
appointee
in
one
of
his
two
capacity
,
but
this
doe
not
prevent
the
requirement
of
a
bond
and
submission
to
the
responsibility
of
an
office
whose
duty
he
can
not
discharge
.
the
superadded
title
of
consul-general
should
be
abandoned
at
all
mission
.
i
deem
it
expedient
that
a
well-devised
measure
for
the
reorganization
of
the
extraterritorial
court
in
oriental
country
should
replace
the
present
system
,
which
labor
under
the
disadvantage
of
combining
judicial
and
executive
function
in
the
same
office
.
in
several
oriental
country
generous
offer
have
been
made
of
premise
for
housing
the
legation
of
the
united
state
.
a
grant
of
land
for
that
purpose
wa
made
some
year
since
by
japan
,
and
ha
been
referred
to
in
the
annual
message
of
my
predecessor
.
the
siamese
government
ha
made
a
gift
to
the
united
state
of
commodious
quarter
in
bangkok
.
in
korea
the
late
minister
wa
permitted
to
purchase
a
building
from
the
government
for
legation
use
.
in
china
the
premise
rented
for
the
legation
are
favored
a
to
local
charge
.
at
tangier
the

by
our
representative

been
for
many

the
property
;
this
government
,
having
been
given
for
that
purpose
in
1822
by
the
sultan
of

.
i
approve
the
suggestion
heretofore
made
,
that
,
view
of
the
condition
of
life
and
administration
in
the
eastern
country
,
the
legation
building
in
china
,
japan
,
korea
,
siam
,
and
perhaps
persia
,
should
be
owned
and
furnished
by
the
government
with
a
view
to
permanency
and
security
.
to
this
end
i
recommend
that
authority
be
given
to
accept
the
gift
adverted
to
in
japan
and
siam
,
and
to
purchase
in
the
other
country

our
import
during
the
year
were
a
follows
:
the
following
are
given
a
prominent
article
of
import
during
the
year
,
with
their
value
and
the
percentage
they
bear
to
the
total
importation
:
of
the
entire
amount
of
duty
collected
70
per
cent
wa
collected
from
the
following
article
of
import
:
the
fact
that
our
revenue
are
in
excess
of
the
actual
need
of
all
economical
administration
of
the
government
justifies
a
reduction
in
the
amount
exacted
from
the
people
for
it
support
.
our
government
is
but
the
mean
established
by
the
will
of
a
free
people
by
which
certain
principle
are
applied
which
they
have
adopted
for
their
benefit
and
protection
;
and
it
is
never
better
administered
and
it
true
spirit
is
never
better
observed
than
when
the
people
's
taxation
for
it
support
is
scrupulously
limited
to
the
actual
necessity
of
expenditure
and
distributed
according
to
a
just
and
equitable
plan
.
the
proposition
with
which
we
have
to
deal
is
the
reduction
of
the
revenue
received
by
the
government
,
and
indirectly
paid
by
the
people
,
from
custom
duty
.
the
question
of
free
trade
is
not
involved
,
nor
is
there
now
any
occasion
for
the
general
discussion
of
the
wisdom
or
expediency
of
a
protective
system
.
justice
and
fairness
dictate
that
in
any
modification
of
our
present
law
relating
to
revenue
the
industry
and
interest
which
have
been
encouraged
by
such
law
,
and
in
which
our
citizen
have
large
investment
,
should
not
be
ruthlessly
injured
or
destroyed
.
we
should
also
deal
with
the
subject
in
such
manner
a
to
protect
the
interest
of
american
labor
,
which
is
the
capital
of
our
workingman
.
it
stability
and
proper
remuneration
furnish
the
most
justifiable
pretext
for
a
protective
policy
.
within
these
limitation
a
certain
reduction
should
be
made
in
our
custom
revenue
.
the
amount
of
such
reduction
having
been
determined
,
the
inquiry
follows
,
where
can
it
best
be
remitted
and
what
article
can
best
be
released
from
duty
in
the
interest
of
our
citizen
?
i
think
the
reduction
should
be
made
in
the
revenue
derived
from
a
tax
upon
the
imported
necessary
of
life
.
we
thus
directly
lessen
the
cost
of
living
in
every
family
of
the
land
and
release
to
the
people
in
every
humble
home
a
larger
measure
of
the
reward
of
frugal
industry
.
during
the
year
ended
november

,
1885
,
145
national
bank
were
organized
,
with
an
aggregate
capital
of
$
16,938,000
,
and
circulating
note
have
been
issued
to
them
amounting
to
$
4,274,910
.
the
whole
number
of
these
bank
in
existence
on
the
day
above
mentioned
wa
2,727
.
the
very
limited
amount
of
circulating
note
issued
by
our
national
bank
,
compared
with
the
amount
the
law
permit
them
to
issue
upon
a
deposit
of
bond
for
their
redemption
,
indicates
that
the
volume
of
our
circulating
medium
may
be
largely
increased
through
this
instrumentality
.
nothing
more
important
than
the
present
condition
of
our
currency
and
coinage
can
claim
your
attention
.
since
february
,
1878
,
the
government
ha
,
under
the
compulsory
provision
of
law
,
purchased
silver
bullion
and
coined
the
same
at
the
rate
of
more
than
$
2,000,000
every
month
.
by
this
process
up
to
the
present
date
215,759,431
silver
dollar
have
been
coined
.
a
reasonable
appreciation
of
a
delegation
of
power
to
the
general
government
would
limit
it
exercise
,
without
express
restrictive
word
,
to
the
people
's
need
and
the
requirement
of
the
public
welfare
.
upon
this
theory
the
authority
to
``
coin
money
''
given
to
congress
by
the
constitution
,
if
it
permit
the
purchase
by
the
government
of
bullion
for
coinage
in
any
event
,
doe
not
justify
such
purchase
and
coinage
to
an
extent
beyond
the
amount
needed
for
a
sufficient
circulating
medium
.
the
desire
to
utilize
the
silver
product
of
the
country
should
not
lead
to
a
misuse
or
the
perversion
of
this
power
.
the
necessity
for
such
an
addition
to
the
silver
currency
of
the
nation
a
is
compelled
by
the
silver-coinage
act
is
negatived
by
the
fact
that
up
to
the
present
time
only
about
50,000,000
of
the
silver
dollar
so
coined
have
actually
found
their
way
into
circulation
,
leaving
more
than
165,000,000
in
the
possession
of
the
government
,
the
custody
of
which
ha
entailed
a
considerable
expense
for
the
construction
of
vault
for
it
deposit
.
against
this
latter
amount
there
are
outstanding
silver
certificate
amounting
to
about
$
93,000,000
.
every
month
two
million
of
gold
in
the
public
treasury
are
paid
our
for
two
million
or
more
of
silver
dollar
,
to
be
added
to
the
idle
mass
already
accumulated
.
if
continued
long
enough
,
this
operation
will
result
in
the
substitution
of
silver
for
all
the
gold
the
government
owns
applicable
to
it
general
purpose
.
it
will
not
do
to
rely
upon
the
custom
receipt
of
the
government
to
make
good
this
drain
of
gold
,
because
the
silver
thus
coined
having
been
made
legal
tender
for
all
debt
and
due
,
public
and
private
,
at
time
during
the
last
six
month
58
per
cent
of
the
receipt
for
duty
ha
been
in
silver
or
silver
certificate
,
while
the
average
within
that
period
ha
been
20
per
cent
.
the
proportion
of
silver
and
it
certificate
received
by
the
government
will
probably
increase
a
time
go
on
,
for
the
reason
that
the
nearer
the
period
approach
when
it
will
be
obliged
to
offer
silver
in
payment
of
it
obligation
the
greater
inducement
there
will
be
to
hoard
gold
against
depreciation
in
the
value
of
silver
or
for
the
purpose
of
speculating
.
this
hoarding
of
gold
ha
already
begun
.
when
the
time
come
that
gold
ha
been
withdrawn
from
circulation
,
then
will
be
apparent
the
difference
between
the
real
value
of
the
silver
dollar
and
a
dollar
in
gold
,
and
the
two
coin
will
part
company
.
gold
,
still
the
standard
of
value
and
necessary
in
our
dealing
with
other
country
,
will
be
at
a
premium
over
silver
;
bank
which
have
substituted
gold
for
the
deposit
of
their
customer
may
pay
them
with
silver
bought
with
such
gold
,
thus
making
a
handsome
profit
;
rich
speculator
will
sell
their
hoarded
gold
to
their
neighbor
who
need
it
to
liquidate
their
foreign
debt
,
at
a
ruinous
premium
over
silver
,
and
the
laboring
men
and
woman
of
the
land
,
most
defenseless
of
all
,
will
find
that
the
dollar
received
for
the
wage
of
their
toil
ha
sadly
shrunk
in
it
purchasing
power
.
it
may
be
said
that
the
latter
result
will
be
but
temporary
,
and
that
ultimately
the
price
of
labor
will
be
adjusted
to
the
change
;
but
even
if
this
take
place
the
wage-worker
can
not
possibly
gain
,
but
must
inevitably
lose
,
since
the
price
he
is
compelled
to
pay
for
his
living
will
not
only
be
measured
in
a
coin
heavily
depreciated
and
fluctuating
and
uncertain
in
it
value
,
but
this
uncertainty
in
the
value
of
the
purchasing
medium
will
be
made
the
pretext
for
an
advance
in
price
beyond
that
justified
by
actual
depreciation
.
the
word
uttered
in
1834
by
daniel
webster
in
the
senate
of
the
united
state
are
true
to-day
:
the
very
man
of
all
others
who
ha
the
deepest
interest
in
a
sound
currency
,
and
who
suffers
most
by
mischievous
legislation
in
money
matter
,
is
the
man
who
earns
his
daily
bread
by
his
daily
toil
.
the
most
distinguished
advocate
of
bimetallism
,
discussing
our
silver
coinage
,
ha
lately
written
:
no
american
citizen
's
hand
ha
yet
felt
the
sensation
of
cheapness
,
either
in
receiving
or
expending
the
silver-act
dollar
.
and
those
who
live
by
labor
or
legitimate
trade
never
will
feel
that
sensation
of
cheapness
.
however
plenty
silver
dollar
may
become
,
they
will
not
be
distributed
a
gift
among
the
people
;
and
if
the
laboring
man
should
receive
four
depreciated
dollar
where
he
now
receives
but
two
,
he
will
pay
in
the
depreciated
coin
more
than
double
the
price
he
now
pay
for
all
the
necessary
and
comfort
of
life
.
those
who
do
not
fear
any
disastrous
consequence
arising
from
the
continued
compulsory
coinage
of
silver
a
now
directed
by
law
,
and
who
suppose
that
the
addition
to
the
currency
of
the
country
intended
a
it
result
will
be
a
public
benefit
,
are
reminded
that
history
demonstrates
that
the
point
is
easily
reached
in
the
attempt
to
float
at
the
same
time
two
sort
of
money
of
different
excellence
when
the
better
will
cease
to
be
in
general
circulation
.
the
hoarding
of
gold
which
ha
already
taken
place
indicates
that
we
shall
not
escape
the
usual
experience
in
such
case
.
so
if
this
silver
coinage
be
continued
we
may
reasonably
expect
that
gold
and
it
equivalent
will
abandon
the
field
of
circulation
to
silver
alone
.
this
of
course
must
produce
a
severe
contraction
of
our
circulating
medium
,
instead
of
adding
to
it
.
it
will
not
be
disputed
that
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
cause
the
circulation
of
silver
dollar
worth
80
cent
side
by
side
with
gold
dollar
worth
100
cent
,
even
within
the
limit
that
legislation
doe
not
run
counter
to
the
law
of
trade
,
to
be
successful
must
be
seconded
by
the
confidence
of
the
people
that
both
coin
will
retain
the
same
purchasing
power
and
be
interchangeable
at
will
.
a
special
effort
ha
been
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
increase
the
amount
of
our
silver
coin
in
circulation
;
but
the
fact
that
a
large
share
of
the
limited
amount
thus
put
out
ha
soon
returned
to
the
public
treasury
in
payment
of
duty
lead
to
the
belief
that
the
people
do
not
now
desire
to
keep
it
in
hand
,
and
this
,
with
the
evident
disposition
to
hoard
gold
,
give
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
there
already
exists
a
lack
of
confidence
among
the
people
touching
our
financial
process
.
there
is
certainly
not
enough
silver
now
in
circulation
to
cause
uneasiness
,
and
the
whole
amount
coined
and
now
on
hand
might
after
a
time
be
absorbed
by
the
people
without
apprehension
;
but
it
is
the
ceaseless
stream
that
threatens
to
overflow
the
land
which
cause
fear
and
uncertainty
.
what
ha
been
thus
far
submitted
upon
this
subject
relates
almost
entirely
to
consideration
of
a
home
nature
,
unconnected
with
the
bearing
which
the
policy
of
other
nation
have
upon
the
question
.
but
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
a
line
of
action
in
regard
to
our
currency
can
not
wisely
be
settled
upon
or
persisted
in
without
considering
the
attitude
on
the
subject
of
other
country
with
whom
we
maintain
intercourse
through
commerce
,
trade
,
and
travel
.
an
acknowledgment
of
this
fact
is
found
in
the
act
by
virtue
of
which
our
silver
is
compulsorily
coined
.
it
provides
that
--
the
president
shall
invite
the
government
of
the
country
composing
the
latin
union
,
so
called
,
and
of
such
other
european
nation
a
he
may
deem
advisable
,
to
join
the
united
state
in
a
conference
to
adopt
a
common
ratio
between
gold
and
silver
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
internationally
the
use
of
bimetallic
money
and
securing
fixity
of
relative
value
between
those
metal
.
this
conference
absolutely
failed
,
and
a
similar
fate
ha
awaited
all
subsequent
effort
in
the
same
direction
.
and
still
we
continue
our
coinage
of
silver
at
a
ratio
different
from
that
of
any
other
nation
.
the
most
vital
part
of
the
silver-coinage
act
remains
inoperative
and
unexecuted
,
and
without
an
ally
or
friend
we
battle
upon
the
silver
field
in
an
illogical
and
losing
contest
.
to
give
full
effect
to
the
design
of
congress
on
this
subject
i
have
made
careful
and
earnest
endeavor
since
the
adjournment
of
the
last
congress
.
to
this
end
i
delegated
a
gentleman
well
instructed
in
fiscal
science
to
proceed
to
the
financial
center
of
europe
and
,
in
conjunction
with
our
minister
to
england
,
france
,
and
germany
,
to
obtain
a
full
knowledge
of
the
attitude
and
intent
of
those
government
in
respect
of
the
establishment
of
such
an
international
ratio
a
would
procure
free
coinage
of
both
metal
at
the
mint
of
those
country
and
our
own
.
by
my
direction
our
consul-general
at
paris
ha
given
close
attention
to
the
proceeding
of
the
congress
of
the
latin
union
,
in
order
to
indicate
our
interest
in
it
object
and
report
it
action
.
it
may
be
said
in
brief
,
a
the
result
of
these
effort
,
that
the
attitude
of
the
leading
power
remains
substantially
unchanged
since
the
monetary
conference
of
1881
,
nor
is
it
to
be
questioned
that
the
view
of
these
government
are
in
each
instance
supported
by
the
weight
of
public
opinion
.
the
step
thus
taken
have
therefore
only
more
fully
demonstrated
the
uselessness
of
further
attempt
at
present
to
arrive
at
any
agreement
on
the
subject
with
other
nation
.
in
the
meantime
we
are
accumulating
silver
coin
,
based
upon
our
own
peculiar
ratio
,
to
such
an
extent
,
and
assuming
so
heavy
a
burden
to
be
provided
for
in
any
international
negotiation
,
a
will
render
u
an
undesirable
party
to
any
future
monetary
conference
of
nation
.
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
four
of
the
five
country
composing
the
latin
union
mentioned
in
our
coinage
act
,
embarrassed
with
their
silver
currency
,
have
just
completed
an
agreement
among
themselves
that
no
more
silver
shall
be
coined
by
their
respective
government
and
that
such
a
ha
been
already
coined
and
in
circulation
shall
be
redeemed
in
gold
by
the
country
of
it
coinage
.
the
resort
to
this
expedient
by
these
country
may
well
arrest
the
attention
of
those
who
suppose
that
we
can
succeed
without
shock
or
injury
in
the
attempt
to
circulate
upon
it
merit
all
the
silver
we
may
coin
under
the
provision
of
our
silver-coinage
act
.
the
condition
in
which
our
treasury
may
be
placed
by
a
persistence
in
our
present
course
is
a
matter
of
concern
to
every
patriotic
citizen
who
doe
not
desire
his
government
to
pay
in
silver
such
of
it
obligation
a
should
be
paid
in
gold
.
nor
should
our
condition
be
such
a
to
oblige
u
,
in
a
prudent
management
of
our
affair
,
to
discontinue
the
calling
in
and
payment
of
interest-bearing
obligation
which
we
have
the
right
now
to
discharge
,
and
thus
avoid
the
payment
of
further
interest
thereon
.
the
so-called
debtor
class
,
for
whose
benefit
the
continued
compulsory
coinage
of
silver
is
insisted
upon
,
are
not
dishonest
because
they
are
in
debt
,
and
they
should
not
be
suspected
of
a
desire
to
jeopardize
the
financial
safety
of
the
country
in
order
that
they
may
cancel
their
present
debt
by
paying
the
same
in
depreciated
dollar
.
nor
should
it
be
forgotten
that
it
is
not
the
rich
nor
the
money
lender
alone
that
must
submit
to
such
a
readjustment
,
enforced
by
the
government
and
their
debtor
.
the
pittance
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
and
the
income
of
helpless
beneficiary
of
all
kind
would
be
disastrously
reduced
.
the
depositor
in
saving
bank
and
in
other
institution
which
hold
in
trust
the
saving
of
the
poor
,
when
their
little
accumulation
are
scaled
down
to
meet
the
new
order
of
thing
,
would

in
july
last
certain
irregularity
were
found
to
exist
in
the
management
of
this
bureau
,
which
led
to
a
prompt
investigation
of
it
method
.
the
abuse
which
were
brought
to
light
by
this
examination
and
the
reckless
disregard
of
duty
and
the
interest
of
the
government
developed
on
the
part
of
some
of
those
connected
with
the
service
made
a
change
of
superintendency
and
a
few
of
it
other
officer
necessary
.
since
the
bureau
ha
been
in
new
hand
an
introduction
of
economy
and
the
application
of
business
method
have
produced
an
important
saving
to
the
government
and
a
promise
of
more
useful
result
.
this
service
ha
never
been
regulated
by
anything
but
the
most
indefinite
legal
enactment
and
the
most
unsatisfactory
rule
.
it
wa
many
year
ago
sanctioned
apparently
for
a
purpose
regarded
a
temporary
and
related
to
a
survey
of
our
coast
.
having
gained
a
place
in
the
appropriation
made
by
congress
,
it
ha
gradually
taken
to
itself
power
and
object
not
contemplated
in
it
creation
and
extended
it
operation
until
it
sadly
need
legislative
attention
.
so
far
a
a
further
survey
of
our
coast
is
concerned
,
there
seems
to
be
a
propriety
in
transferring
that
work
to
the
navy
department
.
the
other
duty
now
in
charge
of
this
establishment
,
if
they
can
not
be
profitably
attached
to
some
existing
department
or
other
bureau
,
should
be
prosecuted
under
a
law
exactly
defining
their
scope
and
purpose
,
and
with
a
careful
discrimination
between
the
scientific
inquiry
which
may
properly
be
assumed
by
the
government
and
those
which
should
be
undertaken
by
state
authority
or
by
individual
enterprise
.
it
is
hoped
that
the
report
of
the
congressional
committee
heretofore
appointed
to
investigate
this
and
other
like
matter
will
aid
in
the
accomplishment
of
proper
legislation
on
this
subject
.
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
is
herewith
submitted
.
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
to
the
detailed
account
which
it
contains
of
the
administration
of
his
department
,
and
his
recommendation
and
suggestion
for
the
improvement
of
the
service
.
the
army
consisted
,
at
the
date
of
the
last
consolidated
return
,
of
2,154
officer
and
24,705
enlisted
men
.
the
expense
of
the
department
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
,
30
,
1885
,
including
$
13,164,394.60
for
public
work
and
river
and
harbor
improvement
,
were
$
45,850,999.54
.
besides
the
troop
which
were
dispatched
in
pursuit
of
the
small
band
of
indian
who
left
their
reservation
in
arizona
and
committed
murder
and
outrage
,
two
regiment
of
cavalry
and
one
of
infantry
were
sent
last
july
to
the
indian
territory
to
prevent
an
outbreak
which
seemed
imminent
.
they
remained
to
aid
,
if
necessary
,
in
the
expulsion
of
intruder
upon
the
reservation
,
who
seemed
to
have
caused
the
discontent
among
the
indian
,
but
the
executive
proclamation
warning
them
to
remove
wa
complied
with
without
their
interference
.
troop
were
also
sent
to
rock
spring
,
in
wyoming
territory
,
after
the
massacre
of
chinese
there
,
to
prevent
further
disturbance
,
and
afterwards
to
seattle
,
in
washington
territory
,
to
avert
a
threatened
attack
upon
chinese
laborer
and
domestic
violence
there
.
in
both
case
the
mere
presence
of
the
troop
had
the
desired
effect
.
it
appears
that
the
number
of
desertion
ha
diminished
,
but
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
they
numbered
2,927
;
and
one
instance
is
given
by
the
lieutenant-general
of
six
desertion
by
the
same
recruit
.
i
am
convinced
that
this
number
of
desertion
can
be
much
diminished
by
better
discipline
and
treatment
;
but
the
punishment
should
be
increased
for
repeated
offense
.
these
desertion
might
also
be
reduced
by
lessening
the
term
of
first
enlistment
,
thus
allowing
a
discontented
recruit
to
contemplate
a
nearer
discharge
and
the
army
a
profitable
riddance
.
after
one
term
of
service
a
reenlistment
would
be
quite
apt
to
secure
a
contented
recruit
and
a
good
soldier
.
the
acting
judge-advocate-general
report
that
the
number
of
trial
by
general
courts-martial
during
the
year
wa
2,328
,
and
that
11,851
trial
took
place
before
garrison
and
regimental
courts-martial
.
the
suggestion
that
probably
more
than
half
the
army
have
been
tried
for
offense
,
great
and
small
,
in
one
year
may
well
arrest
attention
.
of
course
many
of
these
trial
before
garrison
and
regimental
courts-martial
were
for
offense
almost
frivolous
,
and
there
should
,
i
think
,
be
a
way
devised
to
dispose
of
these
in
a
more
summary
and
le
inconvenient
manner
than
by
court-martial
.
if
some
of
the
proceeding
of
courts-martial
which
i
have
had
occasion
to
examine
present
the
idea
of
justice
which
generally
prevail
in
these
tribunal
,
i
am
satisfied
that
they
should
be
much
reformed
if
the
honor
and
the
honesty
of
the
army
and
navy
are
by
their
instrumentality
to
be
vindicated
and
protected

792,592.97

in
view
of
the
fact
referred
to
by
the
secretary
of
war
,
that
the
work
of
this
service
ordinarily
is
of
a
scientific
nature
,
and
the
further
fact
that
it
is
assuming
larger
proportion
constantly
and
becoming
more
and
more
unsuited
to
the
fixed
rule
which
must
govern
the
army
,
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
him
in
the
opinion
that
it
should
be
separately
established
.
if
this
is
done
,
the
scope
and
extent
of
it
operation
should
,
a
nearly
a
possible
,
be
definitely
prescribed
by
law
and
always
capable
of
exact
ascertainment
.
the
military
academy
at
west
point
is
reported
a
being
in
a
high
state
of
efficiency
and
well
equipped
for
the
satisfactory
accomplishment
of
the
purpose
of
it
maintenance
.
the
fact
that
the
class
which
graduate
next
year
is
an
unusually
large
one
ha
constrained
me
to
decline
to
make
appointment
to
second
lieutenancy
in
the
army
from
civil
life
,
so
that
such
vacancy
a
exist
in
these
place
may
be
reserved
for
such
graduate
;
and
yet
it
is
not
probable
that
there
will
be
enough
vacancy
to
provide
position
for
them
all
when
they
leave
the
military
school
.
under
the
prevailing
law
and
usage
those
not
thus
assigned
to
duty
never
actively
enter
the
military
service
.
it
is
suggested
that
the
law
on
this
subject
be
changed
so
that
such
of
these
young
men
a
are
not
at
once
assigned
to
duty
after
graduation
may
be
retained
a
second
lieutenant
in
the
army
if
they
desire
it
,
subject
to
assignment
when
opportunity
occurs
,
and
under
proper
rule
a
to
priority
of
selection
.
the
expenditure
on
account
of
the
military
academy
for
the
last
fiscal
year
,
exclusive
of
the
sum
taken
for
it
purpose
from
appropriation
for
the
support
of
the
army
,
were
$
290,712.07
.
the
act
approved
march
3
,
1885
,
designed
to
compensate
officer
and
enlisted
men
for
loss
of
private
property
while
in
the
service
of
the
united
state
,
is
so
indefinite
in
it
term
and
apparently
admits
so
many
claim
the
adjustment
of
which
could
not
have
been
contemplated
that
if
it
is
to
remain
upon
the
statute
book
it
need
amendment
.
there
should
be
a
general
law
of
congress
prohibiting
the
construction
of
bridge
over
navigable
water
in
such
manner
a
to
obstruct
navigation
,
with
provision
for
preventing
the
same
.
it
seems
that
under
existing
statute
the
government
can
not
intervene
to
prevent
such
a
construction
when
entered
upon
without
it
consent
,
though
when
such
consent
is
asked
and
granted
upon
condition
the
authority
to
insist
upon
such
condition
is
clear
.
thus
it
is
represented
that
while
the
officer
of
the
government
are
with
great
care
guarding
against
the
obstruction
of
navigation
by
a
bridge
across
the
mississippi
river
at
st.
paul
a
large
pier
for
a
bridge
ha
been
built
just
below
this
place
directly
in
the
navigable
channel
of
the
river
.
if
such
thing
are
to
be
permitted
,
a
strong
argument
is
presented
against
the
appropriation
of
large
sum
of
money
to
improve
the
navigation
of
this
and
other
important
highway
of
commerce
.

acceptance

no
one
can
fail
to
see
from
recital
contained
in
this
report
that
only
the
application
of
business
principle
ha
been
insisted
upon
in
the
treatment
of

congress
at
it
last
session
authorized
the
construction
of
two
additional
new
cruiser

two
gunboat
,
at
a
cost
not
exceeding
in
the
aggregate

2,995,000

these
are

lost
which
is
spent
in
their
careful
consideration
and
selection
.
all
must
admit
the
importance
of
an
effective
navy
to
a
nation
like
ours
,
having
such
an
extended
seacoast
to
protect
;
and
yet
we
have
not
a
single
vessel
of
war
that
could
keep
the
sea
against
a
first-class
vessel
of
any
important
power
.
such
a
condition
ought
not
longer
to
continue
.
the
nation
that
can
not
resist
aggression
is
constantly
exposed
to
it
.
it
foreign
policy
is
of
necessity
weak
and
it
negotiation
are
conducted
with
disadvantage
because
it
is
not
in
condition
to
enforce
the
term
dictated
by
it
sense
of
right
and
justice
.
inspired
,
a
i
am
,
by
the
hope
,
shared
by
all
patriotic
citizen
,
that
the
day
is
not
very
far
distant
when
our
navy
will
be
such
a
befits
our
standing
among
the
nation
of
the
earth
,
and
rejoiced
at
every
step
that
lead
in
the
direction
of
such
a
consummation
,
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
especially
direct
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
close
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
,
in
which
the
humiliating
weakness
of
the
present
organization
of
his
department
is
exhibited
and
the
startling
abuse
and
waste
of
it
present
method
are
exposed
.
the
conviction
is
forced
upon
u
with
the
certainty
of
mathematical
demonstration
that
before
we
proceed
further
in
the
restoration
of
a
navy
we
need
a
thoroughly
reorganized
navy
department
.
the
fact
that
within
seventeen
year
more
than
$
75,000,000
have
been
spent
in
the
construction
,
repair
,
equipment
,
and
armament
of
vessel
,
and
the
further
fact
that
instead
of
an
effective
and
creditable
fleet
we
have
only
the
discontent
and
apprehension
of
a
nation
undefended
by
war
vessel
,
added
to
the
disclosure
now
made
,
do
not
permit
u
to
doubt
that
every
attempt
to
revive
our
navy
ha
thus
far
for
the
most
part
been
misdirected
,
and
all
our
effort
in
that
direction
have
been
little
better
than
blind
gropings
and
expensive
,
aimless
folly
.
unquestionably
if
we
are
content
with
the
maintenance
of
a
navy
department
simply
a
a
shabby
ornament
to
the
government
,
a
constant
watchfulness
may
prevent
some
of
the
scandal
and
abuse
which
have
found
their
way
into
our
present
organization
,
and
it
incurable
waste
may
be
reduced
to
the
minimum
.
but
if
we
desire
to
build
ship
for
present
usefulness
instead
of
naval
reminder
of
the
day
that
are
past
,
we
must
have
a
department
organized
for
the
work
,
supplied
with
all
the
talent
and
ingenuity
our
country
affords
,
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
the
experience
of
other
nation
,
systematized
so
that
all
effort
shall
unite
and
lead
in
one
direction
,
and
fully
imbued
with
the
conviction
that
war
vessel
,
though
new
,
are
useless
unless
they
combine
all
that
the
ingenuity
of
man
ha
up
to
this
day
brought
forth
relating
to
their
construction
.
i
earnestly
commend
the
portion
of
the
secretary
's
report
devoted
to
this
subject
to
the
attention
of
congress
,
in
the
hope
that
his
suggestion
touching
the
reorganization
of
his
department
may
be
adopted
a
the
first
step
toward
the
reconstruction
of
our
navy
.
the
affair
of
the
postal
service
are
exhibited
by
the
report
of
the
postmaster-general
,
which
will
be
laid
before
you
.
the
postal
revenue
,
whose
ratio
of
gain
upon
the
rising
prosperity
of
1882
and
1883
outstripped
the
increasing
expense
of
our
growing
service
,
wa
checked
by
the
reduction
in
the
rate
of
letter
postage
which
took
effect
with
the
beginning
of
october
in
the
latter
year
,
and
it
diminished
during
the
two
past
fiscal
year
$
2,790,000
,
in
about
the
proportion
of
$
2,270,000
in
1884
to
$
520,000
in
1885
.
natural
growth
and
development
have
meantime
increased
expenditure
,
resulting
in
a
deficiency
in
the
revenue
to
meet
the
expense
of
the
department
of
five
and
a
quarter
million
dollar
for
the
year
1884
and
eight
and
a
third
million
in
the
last
fiscal
year
.
the
anticipated
and
natural
revival
of
the
revenue
ha
been
oppressed
and
retarded
by
the
unfavorable
business
condition
of
the
country
,
of
which
the
postal
service
is
a
faithful
indicator
.
the
gratifying
fact
is
shown
,
however
,
by
the
report
that
our
returning
prosperity
is
marked
by
a
gain
of
$
380,000
in
the
revenue
of
the
latter
half
of
the
last
year
over
the
corresponding
period
of
the
preceding
year
.
the
change
in
the
weight
of
first-class
matter
which
may
be
carried
for
a
single
rate
of
postage
from
a
half
ounce
to
an
ounce
,
and
the
reduction
by
one-half
of
the
rate
of
newspaper
postage
,
which
,
under
recent
legislation
,
began
with
the
current
year
,
will
operate
to
restrain
the
augmentation
of
receipt
which
otherwise
might
have
been
expected
to
such
a
degree
that
the
scale
of
expense
may
gain
upon
the
revenue
and
cause
an
increased
deficiency
to
be
shown
at
it
close
.
yet
,
after
no
long
period
of
reawakened
prosperity
,
by
proper
economy
it
is
confidently
anticipated
that
even
the
present
low
rate
,
now
a
favorable
a
any
country
affords
,
will
be
adequate
to
sustain
the
cost
of
the
service
.
the
operation
of
the
post-office
department
is
for
the
convenience
and
benefit
of
the
people
,
and
the
method
by
which
they
pay
the
charge
of
this
useful
arm
of
their
public
service
,
so
that
it
be
just
and
impartial
,
is
of
le
importance
to
them
than
the
economical
expenditure
of
the
mean
they
provide
for
it
maintenance
and
the
due
improvement
of
it
agency
,
so
that
they
may
enjoy
it
highest
usefulness
.
a
proper
attention
ha
been
directed
to
the
prevention
of
waste
or
extravagance
,
and
good
result
appear
from
the
report
to
have
already
been
accomplished
.
i
approve
the
recommendation
of
the
postmaster-general
to
reduce
the
charge
on
domestic
money
order
of
$
5
and
le
from
8
to
5
cent
.
this
change
will
materially
aid
those
of
our
people
who
most
of
all
avail
themselves
of
this
instrumentality
,
but
to
whom
the
element
of
cheapness
is
of
the
greatest
importance
.
with
this
reduction
the
system
would
still
remain
self-supporting
.
the
free-delivery
system
ha
been
extended
to
19
additional
city
during
the
year
,
and
178
now
enjoy
it
convenience
.
experience
ha
commended
it
to
those
who
enjoy
it
benefit
,
and
further
enlargement
of
it
facility
is
due
to
other
community
to
which
it
is
adapted
.
in
the
city
where
it
ha
been
established
,
taken
together
the
local
postage
exceeds
it
maintenance
by
nearly
$
1,300,000
.
the
limit
to
which
this
system
is
now
confined
by
law
ha
been
nearly
reached
,
and
the
reason
given
justify
it
extension
,
which
is
proposed
.
it
wa
decided
,
with
my
approbation
,
after
a
sufficient
examination
,
to
be
inexpedient
for
the
post-office
department
to
contract
for
carrying
our
foreign
mail
under
the
additional
authority
given
by
the
last
congress
.
the
amount
limited
wa
inadequate
to
pay
all
within
the
purview
of
the
law
the
full
rate
of
50
cent
per
mile
,
and
it
would
have
been
unjust
and
unwise
to
have
given
it
to
some
and
denied
it
to
others
.
nor
could
contract
have
been
let
under
the
law
to
all
at
a
rate
to
have
brought
the
aggregate
within
the
appropriation
without
such
practical
prearrangement
of
term
a
would
have
violated
it
.
the
rate
of
sea
and
inland
postage
which
wa
proffered
under
another
statute
clearly
appears
to
be
a
fair
compensation
for
the
desired
service
,
being
three
time
the
price
necessary
to
secure
transportation
by
other
vessel
upon
any
route
,
and
much
beyond
the
charge
made
to
private
person
for
service
not
le
burdensome
.
some
of
the
steamship
company
,
upon
the
refusal
of
the
postmaster-general
to
attempt
,
by
the
mean
provided
,
the
distribution
of
the
sum
appropriated
a
an
extra
compensation
,
withdrew
the
service
of
their
vessel
and
thereby
occasioned
slight
inconvenience
,
though
no
considerable
injury
,
the
mail
having
been
dispatched
by
other
mean
.
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
policy
of
subsidizing
any
line
of
public
conveyance
or
travel
,
i
am
satisfied
that
it
should
not
be
done
under
cover
of
an
expenditure
incident
to
the
administration
of
a
department
,
nor
should
there
be
any
uncertainty
a
to
the
recipient
of
the
subsidy
or
any
discretion
left
to
an
executive
officer
a
to
it
distribution
.
if
such
gift
of
the
public
money
are
to
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
any
enterprise
in
the
supposed
interest
of
the
public
,
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
amount
to
be
paid
and
the
beneficiary
might
better
be
determined
by
congress
than
in
any
other
way
.
the
international
congress
of
delegate
from
the
postal
union
country
convened
at
lisbon
,
in
portugal
,
in
february
last
,
and
after
a
session
of
some
week
the
delegate
signed
a
convention
amendatory
of
the
present
postal-union
convention
in
some
particular
designed
to
advance
it
purpose
.
this
additional
act
ha
had
my
approval
and
will
be
laid
before
you
with
the
departmental
report
.
i
approve
the
recommendation
of
the
postmaster-general
that
another
assistant
be
provided
for
his
department
.
i
invite
your
consideration
to
the
several
other
recommendation
contained
in
his
report
.
the
report
of
the
attorney-general
contains
a
history
of
the
conduct
of
the
department
of
justice
during
the
last
year
and
a
number
of
valuable
suggestion
a
to
needed
legislation
,
and
i
invite
your
careful
attention
to
the
same
.
the
condition
of
business
in
the
court
of
the
united
state
is
such
that
there
seems
to
be
an
imperative
necessity
for
remedial
legislation
on
the
subject
.
some
of
these
court
are
so
overburdened
with
pending
cause
that
the
delay
in
determining
litigation
amount
often
to
a
denial
of
justice
.
among
the
plan
suggested
for
relief
is
one
submitted
by
the
attorney-general
.
it
main
feature
are
:
the
transfer
of
all
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
court
to
the
district
court
and
an
increase
of
judge
for
the
latter
where
necessary
;
an
addition
of
judge
to
the
circuit
court
,
and
constituting
them
exclusively
court
of
appeal
,
and
reasonably
limiting
appeal
thereto
;
further
restriction
of
the
right
to
remove
cause
from
the
state
to
federal
court
;
permitting
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
from
the
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territory
only
in
the
same
case
a
they
are
allowed
from
state
court
,
and
guarding
against
an
unnecessary
number
of
appeal
from
the
circuit
court
.
i
approve
the
plan
thus
outlined
,
and
recommend
the
legislation
necessary
for
it
application
to
our
judicial
system
.
the
present
mode
of
compensating
united
state
marshal
and
district
attorney
should
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
changed
.
they
are
allowed
to
charge
against
the
government
certain
fee
for
service
,
their
income
being
measured
by
the
amount
of
such
fee
within
a
fixed
limit
a
to
their
annual
aggregate
.
this
is
a
direct
inducement
for
them
to
make
their
fee
in
criminal
case
a
large
a
possible
in
an
effort
to
reach
the
maximum
sum
permitted
.
a
an
entirely
natural
consequence
,
unscrupulous
marshal
are
found
encouraging
frivolous
prosecution
,
arresting
people
on
petty
charge
of
crime
and
transporting
them
to
distant
place
for
examination
and
trial
,
for
the
purpose
of
earning
mileage
and
other
fee
;
and
district
attorney
uselessly
attend
criminal
examination
far
from
their
place
of
residence
for
the
express
purpose
of
swelling
their
account
against
the
government
.
the
actual
expense
incurred
in
these
transaction
are
also
charged
against
the
government
.
thus
the
right
and
freedom
of
our
citizen
are
outraged
and
public
expenditure
increased
for
the
purpose
of
furnishing
public
officer
pretext
for
increasing
the
measure
of
their
compensation
.
i
think
marshal
and
district
attorney
should
be
paid
salary
,
adjusted
by
a
rule
which
will
make
them
commensurate
with
service
fairly
rendered
.
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
desire
to
suggest
the
advisability
,
if
it
be
found
not
obnoxious
to
constitutional
objection
,
of
investing
united
state
commissioner
with
the
power
to
try
and
determine
certain
violation
of
law
within
the
grade
of
misdemeanor
.
such
trial
might
be
made
to
depend
upon
the
option
of
the
accused
.
the
multiplication
of
small
and
technical
offense
,
especially
under
the
provision
of
our
internal-revenue
law
,
render
some
change
in
our
present
system
very
desirable
in
the
interest
of
humanity
a
well
a
economy
.
the
district
court
are
now
crowded
with
petty
prosecution
,
involving
a
punishment
in
case
of
conviction
,
of
only
a
slight
fine
,
while
the
party
accused
are
harassed
by
an
enforced
attendance
upon
court
held
hundred
of
mile
from
their
home
.
if
poor
and
friendless
,
they
are
obliged
to
remain
in
jail
during
month
,
perhaps
,
that
elapse
before
a
session
of
the
court
is
held
,
and
are
finally
brought
to
trial
surrounded
by
stranger
and
with
but
little
real
opportunity
for
defense
.
in
the
meantime
frequently
the
marshal
ha
charged
against
the
government
his
fee
for
an
arrest
,
the
transportation
of
the
accused
and
the
expense
of
the
same
,
and
for
summoning
witness
before
a
commissioner
,
a
grand
jury
,
and
a
court
;
the
witness
have
been
paid
from
the
public
fund
large
fee
and
traveling
expense
,
and
the
commissioner
and
district
attorney
have
also
made
their
charge
against
the
government
.
this
abuse
in
the
administration
of
our
criminal
law
should
be
remedied
;
and
if
the
plan
above
suggested
is
not
practicable
,
some
other
should
be
devised
.
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
,
containing
an
account
of
the
operation
of
this
important
department
and
much
interesting
information
,
will
be
submitted
for
your
consideration
.
the
most
intricate
and
difficult
subject
in
charge
of
this
department
is
the
treatment
and
management
of
the
indian
.
i
am
satisfied
that
some
progress
may
be
noted
in
their
condition
a
a
result
of
a
prudent
administration
of
the
present
law
and
regulation
for
their
control
.
but
it
is
submitted
that
there
is
lack
of
a
fixed
purpose
or
policy
on
this
subject
,
which
should
be
supplied
.
it
is
useless
to
dilate
upon
the
wrong
of
the
indian
,
and
a
useless
to
indulge
in
the
heartless
belief
that
because
their
wrong
are
revenged
in
their
own
atrocious
manner
,
therefore
they
should
be
exterminated
.
they
are
within
the
care
of
our
government
,
and
their
right
are
,
or
should
be
,
protected
from
invasion
by
the
most
solemn
obligation
.
they
are
properly
enough
called
the
ward
of
the
government
;
and
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
guardianship
involves
on
our
part
effort
for
the
improvement
of
their
condition
and
the
enforcement
of
their
right
.
there
seems
to
be
general
concurrence
in
the
proposition
that
the
ultimate
object
of
their
treatment
should
be
their
civilization
and
citizenship
.
fitted
by
these
to
keep
pace
in
the
march
of
progress
with
the
advanced
civilization
about
them
,
they
will
readily
assimilate
with
the
mass
of
our
population
,
assuming
the
responsibility
and
receiving
the
protection
incident
to
this
condition
.
the
difficulty
appears
to
be
in
the
selection
of
the
mean
to
be
at
present
employed
toward
the
attainment
of
this
result
.
our
indian
population
,
exclusive
of
those
in
alaska
,
is
reported
a
numbering
260,000
,
nearly
all
being
located
on
land
set
apart
for
their
use
and
occupation
,
aggregating
over
134,000,000
acre
.
these
land
are
included
in
the
boundary
of
171
reservation
of
different
dimension
,
scattered
in
21
state
and
territory
,
presenting
great
variation
in
climate
and
in
the
kind
and
quality
of
their
soil
.
among
the
indian
upon
these
several
reservation
there
exist
the
most
marked
difference
in
natural
trait
and
disposition
and
in
their
progress
toward
civilization
.
while
some
are
lazy
,
vicious
,
and
stupid
,
others
are
industrious
,
peaceful
,
and
intelligent
;
while
a
portion
of
them
are
self-supporting
and
independent
,
and
have
so
far
advanced
in
civilization
that
they
make
their
own
law
,
administered
through
officer
of
their
own
choice
,
and
educate
their
child
in
school
of
their
own
establishment
and
maintenance
,
others
still
retain
,
in
squalor
and
dependence
,
almost
the
savagery
of
their
natural
state
.
in
dealing
with
this
question
the
desire
manifested
by
the
indian
should
not
be
ignored
.
here
again
we
find
a
great
diversity
.
with
some
the
tribal
relation
is
cherished
with
the
utmost
tenacity
,
while
it
hold
upon
others
is
considerably
relaxed
;
the
love
of
home
is
strong
with
all
,
and
yet
there
are
those
whose
attachment
to
a
particular
locality
is
by
no
mean
unyielding
;
the
ownership
of
their
land
in
severalty
is
much
desired
by
some
,
while
by
others
,
and
sometimes
among
the
most
civilized
,
such
a
distribution
would
be
bitterly
opposed
.
the
variation
of
their
want
,
growing
out
of
and
connected
with
the
character
of
their
several
location
,
should
be
regarded
.
some
are
upon
reservation
most
fit
for
grazing
,
but
without
flock
or
herd
;
and
some
on
arable
land
,
have
no
agricultural
implement
.
while
some
of
the
reservation
are
double
the
size
necessary
to
maintain
the
number
of
indian
now
upon
them
,
in
a
few
case
,
perhaps
,
they
should
be
enlarged
.
add
to
all
this
the
difference
in
the
administration
of
the
agency
.
while
the
same
duty
are
devolved
upon
all
,
the
disposition
of
the
agent
and
the
manner
of
their
contact
with
the
indian
have
much
to
do
with
their
condition
and
welfare
.
the
agent
who
perfunctorily
performs
his
duty
and
slothfully
neglect
all
opportunity
to
advance
their
moral
and
physical
improvement
and
fails
to
inspire
them
with
a
desire
for
better
thing
will
accomplish
nothing
in
the
direction
of
their
civilization
,
while
he
who
feel
the
burden
of
an
important
trust
and
ha
an
interest
in
his
work
will
,
by
consistent
example
,
firm
yet
considerate
treatment
,
and
well-directed
aid
and
encouragement
,
constantly
lead
those
under
his
charge
toward
the
light
of
their
enfranchisement
.
the
history
of
all
the
progress
which
ha
been
made
in
the
civilization
of
the
indian
i
think
will
disclose
the
fact
that
the
beginning
ha
been
religious
teaching
,
followed
by
or
accompanying
secular
education
.
while
the
self-sacrificing
and
pious
men
and
woman
who
have
aided
in
this
good
work
by
their
independent
endeavor
have
for
their
reward
the
beneficent
result
of
their
labor
and
the
consciousness
of
christian
duty
well
performed
,
their
valuable
service
should
be
fully
acknowledged
by
all
who
under
the
law
are
charged
with
the
control
and
management
of
our
indian
ward
.
what
ha
been
said
indicates
that
in
the
present
condition
of
the
indian
no
attempt
should
be
made
to
apply
a
fixed
and
unyielding
plan
of
action
to
their
varied
and
varying
need
and
circumstance
.
the
indian
bureau
,
burdened
a
it
is
with
their
general
oversight
and
with
the
detail
of
the
establishment
,
can
hardly
posse
itself
of
the
minute
phase
of
the
particular
case
needing
treatment
;
and
thus
the
propriety
of
creating
an
instrumentality
auxiliary
to
those
already
established
for
the
care
of
the
indian
suggests
itself
.
i
recommend
the
passage
of
a
law
authorizing
the
appointment
of
six
commissioner
,
three
of
whom
shall
be
detailed
from
the
army
,
to
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
a
careful
inspection
from
time
to
time
of
all
the
indian
upon
our
reservation
or
subject
to
the
care
and
control
of
the
government
,
with
a
view
of
discovering
their
exact
condition
and
need
and
determining
what
step
shall
be
taken
on
behalf
of
the
government
to
improve
their
situation
in
the
direction
of
their
self-support
and
complete
civilization
;
that
they
ascertain
from
such
inspection
what
,
if
any
,
of
the
reservation
may
be
reduced
in
area
,
and
in
such
case
what
part
not
needed
for
indian
occupation
may
be
purchased
by
the
government
from
the
indian
and
disposed
of
for
their
benefit
;
what
,
if
any
,
indian
may
,
with
their
consent
,
be
removed
to
other
reservation
,
with
a
view
of
their
concentration
and
the
sale
on
their
behalf
of
their
abandoned
reservation
;
what
indian
land
now
held
in
common
should
be
allotted
in
severalty
;
in
what
manner
and
to
what
extent
the
indian
upon
the
reservation
can
be
placed
under
the
protection
of
our
law
and
subjected
to
their
penalty
,
and
which
,
if
any
,
indian
should
be
invested
with
the
right
of
citizenship
.
the
power
and
function
of
the
commissioner
in
regard
to
these
subject
should
be
clearly
defined
,
though
they
should
,
in
conjunction
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
,
be
given
all
the
authority
to
deal
definitely
with
the
question
presented
deemed
safe
and
consistent
.
they
should
be
also
charged
with
the
duty
of
ascertaining
the
indian
who
might
properly
be
furnished
with
implement
of
agriculture
,
and
of
what
kind
;
in
what
case
the
support
of
the
government
should
be
withdrawn
;
where
the
present
plan
of
distributing
indian
supply
should
be
changed
;
where
school
may
be
established
and
where
discontinued
;
the
conduct
,
method
,
and
fitness
of
agent
in
charge
of
reservation
;
the
extent
to
which
such
reservation
are
occupied
or
intruded
upon
by
unauthorized
person
,
and
generally
all
matter
related
to
the
welfare
and
improvement
of
the
indian
.
they
should
advise
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
concerning
these
matter
of
detail
in
management
,
and
he
should
be
given
power
to
deal
with
them
fully
,
if
he
is
not
now
invested
with
such
power
.
this
plan
contemplates
the
selection
of
person
for
commissioner
who
are
interested
in
the
indian
question
and
who
have
practical
idea
upon
the
subject
of
their
treatment
.
the
expense
of
the
indian
bureau
during
the
last
fiscal
year
wa
more
than
six
and
a
halt
million
dollar
.
i
believe
much
of
this
expenditure
might
be
saved
under
the
plan
proposed
;
that
it
economical
effect
would
be
increased
with
it
continuance
;
that
the
safety
of
our
frontier
settler
would
be
subserved
under
it
operation
,
and
that
the
nation
would
be
saved
through
it
result
from
the
imputation
of
inhumanity
,
injustice
,
and
mismanagement
.
in
order
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
allotment
of
indian
land
in
severalty
,
when
deemed
expedient
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
have
survey
completed
of
the
reservation
,
and
,
i
hope
that
provision
will
be
made
for
the
prosecution
of
this
work
.
in
may
of
the
present
year
a
small
portion
of
the
chiricahua
apache
on
the
white
mountain
reservation
,
in
arizona
,
left
the
reservation
and
committed
a
number
of
murder
and
depredation
upon
settler
in
that
neighborhood
.
though
prompt
and
energetic
action
wa
taken
by
the
military
,
the
renegade
eluded
capture
and
escaped
into
mexico
.
the
formation
of
the
country
through
which
these
indian
passed
,
their
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
same
,
the
speed
of
their
escape
,
and
the
manner
in
which
they
scattered
and
concealed
themselves
among
the
mountain
near
the
scene
of
their
outrage
put
our
soldier
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
their
effort
to
capture
them
,
though
the
expectation
is
still
entertained
that
they
will
be
ultimately
taken
and
punished
for
their
crime
.
the
threatening
and
disorderly
conduct
of
the
cheyenne
in
the
indian
territory
early
last
summer
caused
considerable
alarm
and
uneasiness
.
investigation
proved
that
their
threatening
attitude
wa
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
occupation
of
the
land
of
their
reservation
by
immense
herd
of
cattle
,
which
their
owner
claimed
were
rightfully
there
under
certain
lease
made
by
the
indian
.
such
occupation
appearing
upon
examination
to
be
unlawful
notwithstanding
these
lease
,
the
intruder
were
ordered
to
remove
with
their
cattle
from
the
land
of
the
indian
by
executive
proclamation
.
the
enforcement
of
this
proclamation
had
the
effect
of
restoring
peace
and
order
among
the
indian
,
and
they
are
now
quiet
and
well
behaved
.
by
an
executive
order
issued
on
february
27
,
1885
,
by
my
predecessor
,
a
portion
of
the
tract
of
country
in
the
territory
known
a
the
old
winnebago
and
crow
creek
reservation
wa
directed
to
be
restored
to
the
public
domain
and
opened
to
settlement
under
the
land
law
of
the
united
state
,
and
a
large
number
of
person
entered
upon
those
land
.
this
action
alarmed
the
sioux
indian
,
who
claimed
the
territory
a
belonging
to
their
reservation
under
the
treaty
of
1868
.
this
claim
wa
determined
,
after
careful
investigation
,
to
be
well
rounded
,
and
consequently
the
executive
order
referred
to
wa
by
proclamation
of
april
17
,
1885
,
declared
to
be
inoperative
and
of
no
effect
,
and
all
person
upon
the
land
were
warned
to
leave
.
this
warning
ha
been
substantially
complied
with
.
the
public
domain
had
it
origin
in
cession
of
land
by
the
state
to
the
general
government
.
the
first
cession
wa
made
by
the
state
of
new
york
,
and
the
largest
,
which
in
area
exceeded
all
the
others
,
by
the
state
of
virginia
.
the
territory
the
proprietorship
of
which
became
thus
vested
in
the
general
government
extended
from
the
western
line
of
pennsylvania
to
the
mississippi
river
.
these
patriotic
donation
of
the
state
were
encumbered
with
no
condition
except
that
they
should
the
held
and
used
``
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
united
state
.
''
by
purchase
with
the
common
fund
of
all
the
people
addition
were
made
to
this
domain
until
it
extended
to
the
northern
line
of
mexico
,
the
pacific
ocean
,
and
the
polar
sea
.
the
original
trust
,
``
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
united
state
,
''
attached
to
all
.
in
the
execution
of
that
trust
the
policy
of
many
home
,
rather
than
large
estate
,
wa
adopted
by
the
government
.
that
these
might
be
easily
obtained
,
and
be
the
abode
of
security
and
contentment
,
the
law
for
their
acquisition
were
few
,
easily
understood
,
and
general
in
their
character
.
but
the
pressure
of
local
interest
,
combined
with
a
speculative
spirit
,
have
in
many
instance
procured
the
passage
of
law
which
marred
the
harmony
of
the
general
plan
and
encumbered
the
system
with
a
multitude
of
general
and
special
enactment
which
render
the
land
law
complicated
,
subject
the
title
to
uncertainty
,
and
the
purchaser
often
to
oppression
and
wrong
.
law
which
were
intended
for
the
``
common
benefit
''
have
been
perverted
so
that
large
quantity
of
land
are
vesting
in
single
ownership
.
from
the
multitude
and
character
of
the
law
,
this
consequence
seems
incapable
of
correction
by
mere
administration
.
it
is
not
for
the
``
common
benefit
of
the
united
state
''
that
a
large
area
of
the
public
land
should
be
acquired
,
directly
or
through
fraud
,
in
the
hand
of
a
single
individual
.
the
nation
's
strength
is
in
the
people
.
the
nation
's
prosperity
is
in
their
prosperity
.
the
nation
's
glory
is
in
the
equality
of
her
justice
.
the
nation's
perpetuity
is
in
the
patriotism
of
all
her
people
.
hence
,
a
far
a
practicable
,
the
plan
adopted
in
the
disposal
of
the
public
land
should
have
in
view
the
original
policy
,
which
encouraged
many
purchase
of
these
land
for
home
and
discouraged
the
massing
of
large
area
.
exclusive
of
alaska
,
about
three-fifths
of
the
national
domain
ha
been
sold
or
subjected
to
contract
or
grant
.
of
the
remaining
two-fifths
a
considerable
portion
is
either
mountain
or
desert
.
a
rapidly
increasing
population
creates
a
growing
demand
for
home
,
and
the
accumulation
of
wealth
inspires
an
eager
competition
to
obtain
the
public
land
for
speculative
purpose
.
in
the
future
this
collision
of
interest
will
be
more
marked
than
in
the
past
,
and
the
execution
of
the
nation
's
trust
in
behalf
of
our
settler
will
be
more
difficult
.
i
therefore
commend
to
your
attention
the
recommendation
contained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
with
reference
to
the
repeal
and
modification
of
certain
of
our
land
law
.
the
nation
ha
made
princely
grant
and
subsidy
to
a
system
of
railroad
projected
a
great
national
highway
to
connect
the
pacific
state
with
the
east
.
it
ha
been
charged
that
these
donation
from
the
people
have
been
diverted
to
private
gain
and
corrupt
us
,
and
thus
public
indignation
ha
been
aroused
and
suspicion
engendered
.
our
great
nation
doe
not
begrudge
it
generosity
,
but
it
abhors
speculation
and
fraud
;
and
the
favorable
regard
of
our
people
for
the
great
corporation
to
which
these
grant
were
made
can
only
be
revived
by
a
restoration
of
confidence
,
to
be
secured
by
their
constant
,
unequivocal
,
and
clearly
manifested
integrity
.
a
faithful
application
of
the
undiminished
proceeds
of
the
grant
to
the
construction
and
perfecting
of
their
road
,
an
honest
discharge
of
their
obligation
,
and
entire
justice
to
all
the
people
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
right
on
these
highway
of
travel
are
all
the
public
asks
,
and
it
will
be
content
with
no
le
.
to
secure
these
thing
should
be
the
common
purpose
of
the
officer
of
the
government
,
a
well
a
of
the
corporation
.
with
this
accomplishment
prosperity
would
be
permanently
secured
to
the
road
,
and
national
pride
would
take
the
place
of
national
complaint
.
it
appears
from
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
pension
that
there
were
on
the
1st
day
of
july
,
1885
,
345,125
person
borne
upon
the
pension
roll
,
who
were
classified
a
follows
:
army
invalid
,
241,456
;
widow
,
minor
child
,
and
dependent
relative
of
deceased
soldier
,
78,841
;
navy
invalid
,
2,745
;
navy
widow
,
minor
child
,
and
dependent
,
1,926
;
survivor
of
the
war
of
1812
,
2,945
;
and
widow
of
those
who
served
in
that
war
,
17,212
.
about
one
man
in
ten
of
all
those
who
enlisted
in
the
late
war
are
reported
a
receiving
pension
,
exclusive
of
the
dependent
of
deceased
soldier
.
on
the
1st
of
july
,
1875
,
the
number
of
pensioner
wa
234,821
,
and
the
increase
within
the
ten
year
next
thereafter
wa
110,304
.
while
there
is
no
expenditure
of
the
public
fund
which
the
people
more
cheerfully
approve
than
that
made
in
recognition
of
the
service
of
our
soldier
living
and
dead
,
the
sentiment
underlying
the
subject
should
not
be
vitiated
by
the
introduction
of
any
fraudulent
practice
.
therefore
it
is
fully
a
important
that
the
roll
should
be
cleansed
of
all
those
who
by
fraud
have
secured
a
place
thereon
a
that
meritorious
claim
should
be
speedily
examined
and
adjusted
.
the
reform
in
the
method
of
doing
the
business
of

the

the
activity
of
the
inventive
genius
of

there
ha
been
considerable
improvement
made
in
the
prompt
determination
of
application
and
a
consequent
relief
to
expectant
inventor
.
a
number
of
suggestion
and
recommendation
are
contained
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
patent
which
are
well
entitled
to
the
consideration
of
congress
.
in
the
territory
of
utah
the
law
of
the
united
state
passed
for
the
suppression
of
polygamy
ha
been
energetically
and
faithfully
executed
during
the
past
year
,
with
measurably
good
result
.
a
number
of
conviction
have
been
secured
for
unlawful
cohabitation
,
and
in
some
case
plea
of
guilty
have
been
entered
and
a
slight
punishment
imposed
,
upon
a
promise
by
the
accused
that
they
would
not
again
offend
against
the
law
,
nor
advise
,
counsel
,
aid
,
or
abet
in
any
way
it
violation
by
others
.
the
utah
commissioner
express
the
opinion
,
based
upon
such
information
a
they
are
able
to
obtain
,
that
but
few
polygamous
marriage
have
taken
place
in
the
territory
during
the
last
year
.
they
further
report
that
while
there
can
not
be
found
upon
the
registration
list
of
voter
the
name
of
a
man
actually
guilty
of
polygamy
,
and
while
none
of
that
class
are
holding
office
,
yet
at
the
last
election
in
the
territory
all
the
officer
elected
,
except
in
one
county
,
were
men
who
,
though
not
actually
living
in
the
practice
of
polygamy
,
subscribe
to
the
doctrine
of
polygamous
marriage
a
a
divine
revelation
and
a
law
unto
all
higher
and
more
binding
upon
the
conscience
than
any
human
law
,
local
or
national
.
thus
is
the
strange
spectacle
presented
of
a
community
protected
by
a
republican
form
of
government
,
to
which
they
owe
allegiance
,
sustaining
by
their
suffrage
a
principle
and
a
belief
which
set
at
naught
that
obligation
of
absolute
obedience
to
the
law
of
the
land
which
lie
at
the
foundation
of
republican
institution
.
the
strength
,
the
perpetuity
,
and
the
destiny
of
the
nation
rest
upon
our
home
,
established
by
the
law
of
god
,
guarded
by
parental
care
,
regulated
by
parental
authority
,
and
sanctified
by
parental
love
.
these
are
not
the
home
of
polygamy
.
the
mother
of
our
land
,
who
rule
the
nation
a
they
mold
the
character
and
guide
the
action
of
their
son
,
live
according
to
god
'
s
holy
ordinance
,
and
each
,
secure
and
happy
in
the
exclusive
love
of
the
father
of
her
child
,
shed
the
warm
light
of
true
womanhood
,
unperverted
and
unpolluted
,
upon
all
within
her
pure
and
wholesome
family
circle
.
these
are
not
the
cheerless
,
crushed
,
and
unwomanly
mother
of
polygamy
.
the
father
of
our
family
are
the
best
citizen
of
the
republic
.
wife
and
child
are
the
source
of
patriotism
,
and
conjugal
and
parental
affection
beget
devotion
to
the
country
.
the
man
who
,
undefiled
with
plural
marriage
,
is
surrounded
in
his
single
home
with
his
wife
and
child
ha
a
stake
in
the
country
which
inspires
him
with
respect
for
it
law
and
courage
for
it
defense
.
these
are
not
the
father
of
polygamous
family
.
there
is
no
feature
of
this
practice
or
the
system
which
sanction
it
which
is
not
opposed
to
all
that
is
of
value
in
our
institution
.
there
should
be
no
relaxation
in
the
firm
but
just
execution
of
the
law
now
in
operation
,
and
i
should
be
glad
to
approve
such
further
discreet
legislation
a
will
rid
the
country
of
this
blot
upon
it
fair
fame
.
since
the
people
upholding
polygamy
in
our
territory
are
reenforced
by
immigration
from
other
land
,
i
recommend
that
a
law
be
passed
to
prevent
the
importation
of
mormon
into
the
country
.
the
agricultural
interest
of
the
country
demand
just
recognition
and
liberal
encouragement
.
it
sustains
with
certainty
and
unfailing
strength
our
nation
's
prosperity
by
the
product
of
it
steady
toil
,
and
bear
it
full
share
of
the
burden
of
taxation
without
complaint
.
our
agriculturist
have
but
slight
personal
representation
in
the
council
of
the
nation
,
and
are
generally
content
with
the
humbler
duty
of
citizenship
and
willing
to
trust
to
the
bounty
of
nature
for
a
reward
of
their
labor
.
but
the
magnitude
and
value
of
this
industry
are
appreciated
when
the
statement
is
made
that
of
our
total
annual
export
more
than
three-fourths
are
the
product
of
agriculture
,
and
of
our
total
population
nearly
one-half
are
exclusively
engaged
in
that
occupation
.
the
department
of
agriculture
wa
created
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
and
diffusing
among
the
people
useful
information
respecting
the
subject
it
ha
in
charge
,
and
aiding
in
the
cause
of
intelligent
and
progressive
farming
,
by
the
collection
of
statistic
,
by
testing
the
value
and
usefulness
of
new
seed
and
plant
,
and
distributing
such
a
are
found
desirable
among
agriculturist
.
this
and
other
power
and
duty
with
which
this
department
is
invested
are
of
the
utmost
importance
,
and
if
wisely
exercised
must
be
of
great
benefit
to
the
country
.
the
aim
of
our
beneficent
government
is
the
improvement
of
the
people
in
every
station
and
the
amelioration
of
their
condition
.
surely
our
agriculturist
should
not
be
neglected
.
the
instrumentality
established
in
aid
of
the
farmer
of
the
land
should
not
only
be
well
equipped
for
the
accomplishment
of
it
purpose
,
but
those
for
whose
benefit
it
ha
been
adopted
should
be
encouraged
to
avail
themselves
fully
of
it
advantage
.
the
prohibition
of
the
importation
into
several
country
of
certain
of
our
animal
and
their
product
,
based
upon
the
suspicion
that
health
is
endangered
in
their
use
and
consumption
,
suggests
the
importance
of
such
precaution
for
the
protection
of
our
stock
of
all
kind
against
disease
a
will
disarm
suspicion
of
danger
and
cause
the
removal
of
such
an
injurious
prohibition
.
if
the
law
now
in
operation
are
insufficient
to
accomplish
this
protection
,
i
recommend
their
amendment
to
meet
the
necessity
of
the
situation
;
and
i
commend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
suggestion
contained
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
calculated
to
increase
the
value
and
efficiency
of
this
department
.
the
report
of
the
civil
service
commission
,
which
will
be
submitted
,
contains
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
civil-service
law
ha
been
executed
during
the
last
year
and
much
valuable
information
on
this
important
subject
.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
is
no
sentiment
more
general
in
the
mind
of
the
people
of
our
country
than
a
conviction
of
the
correctness
of
the
principle
upon
which
the
law
enforcing
civil-service
reform
is
based
.
in
it
present
condition
the
law
regulates
only
a
part
of
the
subordinate
public
position
throughout
the
country
.
it
applies
the
test
of
fitness
to
applicant
for
these
place
by
mean
of
a
competitive
examination
,
and
give
large
discretion
to
the
commissioner
a
to
the
character
of
the
examination
and
many
other
matter
connected
with
it
execution
.
thus
the
rule
and
regulation
adopted
by
the
commission
have
much
to
do
with
the
practical
usefulness
of
the
statute
and
with
the
result
of
it
application
.
the
people
may
well
trust
the
commission
to
execute
the
law
with
perfect
fairness
and
with
a
little
irritation
a
is
possible
.
but
of
course
no
relaxation
of
the
principle
which
underlies
it
and
no
weakening
of
the
safeguard
which
surround
it
can
be
expected
.
experience
in
it
administration
will
probably
suggest
amendment
of
the
method
of
it
execution
,
but
i
venture
to
hope
that
we
shall
never
again
be
remitted
to
the
system
which
distributes
public
position
purely
a
reward
for
partisan
service
.
doubt
may
well
be
entertained
whether
our
government
could
survive
the
strain
of
a
continuance
of
this
system
,
which
upon
every
change
of
administration
inspires
an
immense
army
of
claimant
for
office
to
lay
siege
to
the
patronage
of
government
,
engrossing
the
time
of
public
officer
with
their
importunity
,
spreading
abroad
the
contagion
of
their
disappointment
,
and
filling
the
air
with
the
tumult
of
their
discontent
.
the
allurement
of
an
immense
number
of
office
and
place
exhibited
to
the
voter
of
the
land
,
and
the
promise
of
their
bestowal
in
recognition
of
partisan
activity
;
debauch
the
suffrage
and
rob
political
action
of
it
thoughtful
and
deliberative
character
.
the
evil
would
increase
with
the
multiplication
of
office
consequent
upon
our
extension
,
and
the
mania
for
office
holding
,
growing
from
it
indulgence
,
would
pervade
our
population
so
generally
that
patriotic
purpose
,
the
support
of
principle
,
the
desire
for
the
public
good
,
and
solicitude
for
the
nation
's
welfare
would
be
nearly
banished
from
the
activity
of
our
party
contest
and
cause
them
to
degenerate
into
ignoble
,
selfish
,
and
disgraceful
struggle
for
the
possession
of
office
and
public
place
.
civil-service
reform
enforced
by
law
came
none
too
soon
to
check
the
progress
of
demoralization
.
one
of
it
effect
,
not
enough
regarded
,
is
the
freedom
it
brings
to
the
political
action
of
those
conservative
and
sober
men
who
,
in
fear
of
the
confusion
and
risk
attending
an
arbitrary
and
sudden
change
in
all
the
public
office
with
a
change
of
party
rule
,
cast
their
ballot
against
such
a
chance
.
party
seem
to
be
necessary
,
and
will
long
continue
to
exist
;
nor
can
it
be
now
denied
that
there
are
legitimate
advantage
,
not
disconnected
with
office
holding
,
which
follow
party
supremacy
.
while
partisanship
continues
bitter
and
pronounced
and
supply
so
much
of
motive
to
sentiment
and
action
,
it
is
not
fair
to
hold
public
official
in
charge
of
important
trust
responsible
for
the
best
result
in
the
performance
of
their
duty
,
and
yet
insist
that
they
shall
rely
in
confidential
and
important
place
upon
the
work
of
those
not
only
opposed
to
them
in
political
affiliation
,
but
so
steeped
in
partisan
prejudice
and
rancor
that
they
have
no
loyalty
to
their
chief
and
no
desire
for
their
success
.
civil-service
reform
doe
not
exact
this
,
nor
doe
it
require
that
those
in
subordinate
position
who
fail
in
yielding
their
best
service
or
who
are
incompetent
should
be
retained
simply
because
they
are
in
place
.
the
whining
of
a
clerk
discharged
for
indolence
or
incompetency
,
who
,
though
he
gained
his
place
by
the
worst
possible
operation
of
the
spoil
system
,
suddenly
discovers
that
he
is
entitled
to
protection
under
the
sanction
of
civil-service
reform
,
represents
an
idea
no
le
absurd
than
the
clamor
of
the
applicant
who
claim
the
vacant
position
a
his
compensation
for
the
most
questionable
party
work
.
the
civil-service
law
doe
not
prevent
the
discharge
of
the
indolent
or
incompetent
clerk
,
but
it
doe
prevent
supplying
his
place
with
the
unfit
party
worker
.
thus
in
both
these
phase
is
seen
benefit
to
the
public
service
.
and
the
people
who
desire
good
government
,
having
secured
this
statute
,
will
not
relinquish
it
benefit
without
protest
.
nor
are
they
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
it
full
advantage
can
only
be
gained
through
the
complete
good
faith
of
those
having
it
execution
in
charge
.
and
this
they
will
insist
upon
.
i
recommend
that
the
salary
of
the
civil
service
commissioner
be
increased
to
a
sum
more
nearly
commensurate
to
their
important
duty
.
it
is
a
source
of
considerable
and
not
unnatural
discontent
that
no
adequate
provision
ha
yet
been
made
for
accommodating
the
principal
library
of
the
government
.
of
the
vast
collection
of
book
and
pamphlet
gathered
at
the
capitol
,
numbering
some
700,000
,
exclusive
of
manuscript
,
map
,
and
the
product
of
the
graphic
art
,
also
of
great
volume
and
value
,
only
about
300,000
volume
,
or
le
than
half
the
collection
,
are
provided
with
shelf
room
.
the
others
,
which
are
increasing
at
the
rate
of
from
twenty-five
to
thirty
thousand
volume
a
year
,
are
not
only
inaccessible
to
the
public
,
but
are
subject
to
serious
damage
and
deterioration
from
other
cause
in
their
present
situation
.
a
consideration
of
the
fact
that
the
library
of
the
capitol
ha
twice
been
destroyed
or
damaged
by
fire
,
it
daily
increasing
value
,
and
it
importance
a
a
place
of
deposit
of
book
under
the
law
relating
to
copyright
make
manifest
the
necessity
of
prompt
action
to
insure
it
proper
accommodation
and
protection
.
my
attention
ha
been
called
to
a
controversy
which
ha
arisen
from
the
condition
of
the
law
relating
to
railroad
facility
in
the
city
of
washington
,
which
ha
involved
the
commissioner
of
the
district
in
much
annoyance
and
trouble
.
i
hope
this
difficulty
will
be
promptly
settled
by
appropriate
legislation
.
the
commissioner
represent
that
enough
of
the
revenue
of
the
district
are
now
on
deposit
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
state
to
repay
the
sum
advanced
by
the
government
for
sewer
improvement
under
the
act
of
june
30
,
1884
.
they
desire
now
an
advance
of
the
share
which
ultimately
should
be
borne
by
the
district
of
the
cost
of
extensive
improvement
to
the
street
of
the
city
.
the
total
expense
of
these
contemplated
improvement
is
estimated
at
$
1,000,000
,
and
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
a
considerable
sum
could
be
saved
if
they
had
all
the
money
in
hand
,
so
that
contract
for
the
whole
work
could
be
made
at
the
same
time
.
they
express
confidence
that
if
the
advance
asked
for
should
be
made
the
government
would
be
reimbursed
the
same
within
a
reasonable
time
.
i
have
no
doubt
that
these
improvement
could
be
made
much
cheaper
if
undertaken
together
and
prosecuted
according
to
a
general
plan
.
the
license
law
now
in
force
within
the
district
is
deficient
and
uncertain
in
some
of
it
provision
and
ought
to
be
amended
.
the
commissioner
urge
,
with
good
reason
,
the
necessity
of
providing
a
building
for
the
use
of
the
district
government
which
shall
better
secure
the
safety
and
preservation
of
it
valuable
book
and
record
.
the
present
condition
of
the
law
relating
to
the
succession
to
the
presidency
in
the
event
of
the
death
,
disability
,
or
removal
of
both
the
president
and
vice-president
is
such
a
to
require
immediate
amendment
.
this
subject
ha
repeatedly
been
considered
by
congress
,
but
no
result
ha
been
reached
.
the
recent
lamentable
death
of
the
vice-president
,
and
vacancy
at
the
same
time
in
all
other
office
the
incumbent
of
which
might
immediately
exercise
the
function
of
the
presidential
office
,
ha
caused
public
anxiety
and
a
just
demand
that
a
recurrence
of
such
a
condition
of
affair
should
not
be
permitted
.
in
conclusion
