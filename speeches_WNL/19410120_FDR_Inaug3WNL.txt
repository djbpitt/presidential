on
each
national
day
of
inauguration
since
1789
,
the
people
have
renewed
their
sense
of
dedication
to
the
united
state
.

in
this
day
the
task
of
the
people
is
to
save
that
nation
and
it
institution
from
disruption
from
without
.
to
u
there
ha
come
a
time
,
in
the
midst
of
swift
happening
,
to
pause
for
a
moment
and
take
stock—to
recall
what
our
place
in
history
ha
been
,
and
to
rediscover
what
we
are
and
what
we
may
be
.
if
we
do
not
,
we
risk
the
real
peril
of
isolation
,
the
real
peril
of
inaction
.
life
of
nation
are
determined
not
by
the
count
of
year
,
but
by
the
lifetime
of
the
human
spirit
.
the
life
of
a
man
is
threescore
year
and
ten
:
a
little
more
,
a
little
le
.
the
life
of
a
nation
is
the
fullness
of
the
measure
of
it
will
to
live
.
there
are
men
who
doubt
this
.
there
are
men
who
believe
that
democracy
,
a
a
form
of
government
and
a
frame
of
life
,
is
limited
or
measured
by
a
kind
of
mystical
and
artificial
fate
that
,
for
some
unexplained
reason
,
tyranny
and
slavery
have
become
the
surging
wave
of
the
future—and
that
freedom
is
an
ebbing
tide
.
but
we
american
know
that
this
is
not
true
.
eight
year
ago
,
when
the
life
of
this
republic
seemed
frozen
by
a
fatalistic
terror
,
we
proved
that
this
is
not
true
.
we
were
in
the
midst
of
shock—but
we
acted
.
we
acted
quickly
,
boldly
,
decisively
.
these
later
year
have
been
living
years—fruitful
year
for
the
people
of
this
democracy
.
for
they
have
brought
to
u
greater
security
and
,
i
hope
,
a
better
understanding
that
life
's
ideal
are
to
be
measured
in
other
than
material
thing
.
most
vital
to
our
present
and
to
our
future
is
this
experience
of
a
democracy
which
successfully
survived
crisis
at
home
;
put
away
many
evil
thing
;
built
new
structure
on
enduring
line
;
and
,
through
it
all
,
maintained
the
fact
of
it
democracy
.
for
action
ha
been
taken
within
the
three-way
framework
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
.
the
coordinate
branch
of
the
government
continue
freely
to
function
.
the
bill
of
right
remains
inviolate
.
the
freedom
of
election
is
wholly
maintained
.
prophet
of
the
downfall
of
american
democracy
have
seen
their
dire
prediction
come
to
naught
.
no
,
democracy
is
not
dying
.
we
know
it
because
we
have
seen
it
revive—and
grow
.
we
know
it
can
not
die—because
it
is
built
on
the
unhampered
initiative
of
individual
men
and
woman
joined
together
in
a
common
enterprise—an
enterprise
undertaken
and
carried
through
by
the
free
expression
of
a
free
majority
.
we
know
it
because
democracy
alone
,
of
all
form
of
government
,
enlists
the
full
force
of
men
's
enlightened
will
.
we
know
it
because
democracy
alone
ha
constructed
an
unlimited
civilization
capable
of
infinite
progress
in
the
improvement
of
human
life
.
we
know
it
because
,
if
we
look
below
the
surface
,
we
sense
it
still
spreading
on
every
continent—for
it
is
the
most
humane
,
the
most
advanced
,
and
in
the
end
the
most
unconquerable
of
all
form
of
human
society
.
a
nation
,
like
a
person
,
ha
a
body—a
body
that
must
be
fed
and
clothed
and
housed
,
invigorated
and
rested
,
in
a
manner
that
measure
up
to
the
standard
of
our
time
.
a
nation
,
like
a
person
,
ha
a
mind—a
mind
that
must
be
kept
informed
and
alert
,
that
must
know
itself
,
that
understands
the
hope
and
the
need
of
it
neighbors—all
the
other
nation
that
live
within
the
narrowing
circle
of
the
world
.
a
nation
,
like
a
person
,
ha
something
deeper
,
something
more
permanent
,
something
larger
than
the
sum
of
all
it
part
.
it
is
that
something
which
matter
most
to
it
future—which
call
forth
the
most
sacred
guarding
of
it
present
.
it
is
a
thing
for
which
we
find
it
difficult—even
impossible
to
hit
upon
a
single
,
simple
word
.
and
yet
,
we
all
understand
what
it
is—the
spirit-the
faith
of
america
.
it
is
the
product
of
century
.
it
wa
born
in
the
multitude
of
those
who
came
from
many
lands-some
of
high
degree
,
but
mostly
plain
people—who
sought
here
,
early
and
late
,
to
find
freedom
more
freely
.
the
democratic
aspiration
is
no
mere
recent
phase
in
human
history
.
it
is
human
history
.
it
permeated
the
ancient
life
of
early
people
.
it
blazed
anew
in
the
middle
age
.
it
wa
written
in
magna
charta
.
in
the
america
it
impact
ha
been
irresistible
.
america
ha
been
the
new
world
in
all
tongue
,
and
to
all
people
,
not
because
this
continent
wa
a
new-found
land
,
but
because
all
those
who
came
here
believed
they
could
create
upon
this
continent
a
new
life—a
life
that
should
be
new
in
freedom
.
it
vitality
wa
written
into
our
own
mayflower
compact
,
into
the
declaration
of
independence
,
into
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
,
into
the
gettysburg
address
.
those
who
first
came
here
to
carry
out
the
longing
of
their
spirit
,
and
the
million
who
followed
,
and
the
stock
that
sprang
from
them—all
have
moved
forward
constantly
and
consistently
toward
an
ideal
which
in
itself
ha
gained
stature
and
clarity
with
each
generation
.
the
hope
of
the
republic
can
not
forever
tolerate
either
undeserved
poverty
or
self-serving
wealth
.
we
know
that
we
still
have
far
to
go
;
that
we
must
more
greatly
build
the
security
and
the
opportunity
and
the
knowledge
of
every
citizen
,
in
the
measure
justified
by
the
resource
and
the
capacity
of
the
land
.
but
it
is
not
enough
to
achieve
these
purpose
alone
.
it
is
not
enough
to
clothe
and
feed
the
body
of
this
nation
,
to
instruct
,
and
inform
it
mind
.
for
there
is
also
the
spirit
.
and
of
the
three
,
the
greatest
is
the
spirit
.
without
the
body
and
the
mind
,
a
all
men
know
,
the
nation
could
not
live
.
but
if
the
spirit
of
america
were
killed
,
even
though
the
nation
's
body
and
mind
,
constricted
in
an
alien
world
,
lived
on
,
the
america
we
know
would
have
perished
.
that
spirit—that
faith—speaks
to
u
in
our
daily
life
in
way
often
unnoticed
,
because
they
seem
so
obvious
.
it
speaks
to
u
here
in
the
capital
of
the
nation
.
it
speaks
to
u
through
the
process
of
governing
in
the
sovereignty
of
48
state
.
it
speaks
to
u
in
our
county
,
in
our
city
,
in
our
town
,
and
in
our
village
.
it
speaks
to
u
from
the
other
nation
of
the
hemisphere
,
and
from
those
across
the
seas—the
enslaved
,
a
well
a
the
free
.
sometimes
we
fail
to
hear
or
heed
these
voice
of
freedom
because
to
u
the
privilege
of
our
freedom
is
such
an
old
,
old
story
.
the
destiny
of
america
wa
proclaimed
in
word
of
prophecy
spoken
by
our
first
president
in
his
first
inaugural
in
1789—words
almost
directed
,
it
would
seem
,
to
this
year
of
1941
:
``
the
preservation
of
the
sacred
fire
of
liberty
and
the
destiny
of
the
republican
model
of
government
are
justly
considered
.
.
.
deeply
,
.
.
.
finally
,
staked
on
the
experiment
intrusted
to
the
hand
of
the
american
people
.
''
if
you
and
i
in
this
later
day
lose
that
sacred
fire—if
we
let
it
be
smothered
with
doubt
and
fear—then
we
shall
reject
the
destiny
which
washington
strove
so
valiantly
and
so
triumphantly
to
establish
.
the
preservation
of
the
spirit
and
faith
of
the
nation
doe
,
and
will
,
furnish
the
highest
justification
for
every
sacrifice
that
we
may
make
in
the
cause
of
national
defense
.
in
the
face
of
great
peril
never
before
encountered
,
our
strong
purpose
is
to
protect
and
to
perpetuate
the
integrity
of
democracy
.
for
this
we
muster
the
spirit
of
america
,
and
the
faith
of
america
.
we
do
not
retreat
.
we
are
not
content
to
stand
still
.
a
american
,
we
go
forward
,
in
the
service
of
our
country
,
by
the
will
of
god
.
