unwilling
to
depart
from
example
of
the
most
revered
authority
,
i
avail
myself
of
the
occasion
now
presented
to
express
the
profound
impression
made
on
me
by
the
call
of
my
country
to
the
station
to
the
duty
of
which
i
am
about
to
pledge
myself
by
the
most
solemn
of
sanction
.
so
distinguished
a
mark
of
confidence
,
proceeding
from
the
deliberate
and
tranquil
suffrage
of
a
free
and
virtuous
nation
,
would
under
any
circumstance
have
commanded
my
gratitude
and
devotion
,
a
well
a
filled
me
with
an
awful
sense
of
the
trust
to
be
assumed
.
under
the
various
circumstance
which
give
peculiar
solemnity
to
the
existing
period
,
i
feel
that
both
the
honor
and
the
responsibility
allotted
to
me
are
inexpressibly
enhanced
.
the
present
situation
of
the
world
is
indeed
without
a
parallel
and
that
of
our
own
country
full
of
difficulty
.
the
pressure
of
these
,
too
,
is
the
more
severely
felt
because
they
have
fallen
upon
u
at
a
moment
when
the
national
prosperity
being
at
a
height
not
before
attained
,
the
contrast
resulting
from
the
change
ha
been
rendered
the
more
striking
.
under
the
benign
influence
of
our
republican
institution
,
and
the
maintenance
of
peace
with
all
nation
whilst
so
many
of
them
were
engaged
in
bloody
and
wasteful
war
,
the
fruit
of
a
just
policy
were
enjoyed
in
an
unrivaled
growth
of
our
faculty
and
resource
.
proof
of
this
were
seen
in
the
improvement
of
agriculture
,
in
the
successful
enterprise
of
commerce
,
in
the
progress
of
manufacturer
and
useful
art
,
in
the
increase
of
the
public
revenue
and
the
use
made
of
it
in
reducing
the
public
debt
,
and
in
the
valuable
work
and
establishment
everywhere
multiplying
over
the
face
of
our
land
.
it
is
a
precious
reflection
that
the
transition
from
this
prosperous
condition
of
our
country
to
the
scene
which
ha
for
some
time
been
distressing
u
is
not
chargeable
on
any
unwarrantable
view
,
nor
,
a
i
trust
,
on
any
involuntary
error
in
the
public
council
.
indulging
no
passion
which
trespass
on
the
right
or
the
repose
of
other
nation
,
it
ha
been
the
true
glory
of
the
united
state
to
cultivate
peace
by
observing
justice
,
and
to
entitle
themselves
to
the
respect
of
the
nation
at
war
by
fulfilling
their
neutral
obligation
with
the
most
scrupulous
impartiality
.
if
there
be
candor
in
the
world
,
the
truth
of
these
assertion
will
not
be
questioned
;
posterity
at
least
will
do
justice
to
them
.
this
unexceptionable
course
could
not
avail
against
the
injustice
and
violence
of
the
belligerent
power
.
in
their
rage
against
each
other
,
or
impelled
by
more
direct
motif
,
principle
of
retaliation
have
been
introduced
equally
contrary
to
universal
reason
and
acknowledged
law
.
how
long
their
arbitrary
edict
will
be
continued
in
spite
of
the
demonstration
that
not
even
a
pretext
for
them
ha
been
given
by
the
united
state
,
and
of
the
fair
and
liberal
attempt
to
induce
a
revocation
of
them
,
can
not
be
anticipated
.
assuring
myself
that
under
every
vicissitude
the
determined
spirit
and
united
council
of
the
nation
will
be
safeguard
to
it
honor
and
it
essential
interest
,
i
repair
to
the
post
assigned
me
with
no
other
discouragement
than
what
spring
from
my
own
inadequacy
to
it
high
duty
.
if
i
do
not
sink
under
the
weight
of
this
deep
conviction
it
is
because
i
find
some
support
in
a
consciousness
of
the
purpose
and
a
confidence
in
the
principle
which
i
bring
with
me
into
this
arduous
service
.
to
cherish
peace
and
friendly
intercourse
with
all
nation
having
correspondent
disposition
;
to
maintain
sincere
neutrality
toward
belligerent
nation
;
to
prefer
in
all
case
amicable
discussion
and
reasonable
accommodation
of
difference
to
a
decision
of
them
by
an
appeal
to
arm
;
to
exclude
foreign
intrigue
and
foreign
partiality
,
so
degrading
to
all
country
and
so
baneful
to
free
one
;
to
foster
a
spirit
of
independence
too
just
to
invade
the
right
of
others
,
too
proud
to
surrender
our
own
,
too
liberal
to
indulge
unworthy
prejudice
ourselves
and
too
elevated
not
to
look
down
upon
them
in
others
;
to
hold
the
union
of
the
state
a
the
basis
of
their
peace
and
happiness
;
to
support
the
constitution
,
which
is
the
cement
of
the
union
,
a
well
in
it
limitation
a
in
it
authority
;
to
respect
the
right
and
authority
reserved
to
the
state
and
to
the
people
a
equally
incorporated
with
and
essential
to
the
success
of
the
general
system
;
to
avoid
the
slightest
interference
with
the
right
of
conscience
or
the
function
of
religion
,
so
wisely
exempted
from
civil
jurisdiction
;
to
preserve
in
their
full
energy
the
other
salutary
provision
in
behalf
of
private
and
personal
right
,
and
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
;
to
observe
economy
in
public
expenditure
;
to
liberate
the
public
resource
by
an
honorable
discharge
of
the
public
debt
;
to
keep
within
the
requisite
limit
a
standing
military
force
,
always
remembering
that
an
armed
and
trained
militia
is
the
firmest
bulwark
of
republic
--
that
without
standing
army
their
liberty
can
never
be
in
danger
,
nor
with
large
one
safe
;
to
promote
by
authorized
mean
improvement
friendly
to
agriculture
,
to
manufacture
,
and
to
external
a
well
a
internal
commerce
;
to
favor
in
like
manner
the
advancement
of
science
and
the
diffusion
of
information
a
the
best
aliment
to
true
liberty
;
to
carry
on
the
benevolent
plan
which
have
been
so
meritoriously
applied
to
the
conversion
of
our
aboriginal
neighbor
from
the
degradation
and
wretchedness
of
savage
life
to
a
participation
of
the
improvement
of
which
the
human
mind
and
manner
are
susceptible
in
a
civilized
state
--
a
far
a
sentiment
and
intention
such
a
these
can
aid
the
fulfillment
of
my
duty
,
they
will
be
a
resource
which
can
not
fail
me
.
it
is
my
good
fortune
,
moreover
,
to
have
the
path
in
which
i
am
to
tread
lighted
by
example
of
illustrious
service
successfully
rendered
in
the
most
trying
difficulty
by
those
who
have
marched
before
me
.
of
those
of
my
immediate
predecessor
it
might
least
become
me
here
to
speak
.
i
may
,
however
,
be
pardoned
for
not
suppressing
the
sympathy
with
which
my
heart
is
full
in
the
rich
reward
he
enjoys
in
the
benediction
of
a
beloved
country
,
gratefully
bestowed
or
exalted
talent
zealously
devoted
through
a
long
career
to
the
advancement
of
it
highest
interest
and
happiness
.
but
the
source
to
which
i
look
or
the
aid
which
alone
can
supply
my
deficiency
is
in
the
well-tried
intelligence
and
virtue
of
my
fellow-citizens
,
and
in
the
counsel
of
those
representing
them
in
the
other
department
associated
in
the
care
of
the
national
interest
.
in
these
my
confidence
will
under
every
difficulty
be
best
placed
,
next
to
that
which
we
have
all
been
encouraged
to
feel
in
the
guardianship
and
guidance
of
that
almighty
being
whose
power
regulates
the
destiny
of
nation
,
whose
blessing
have
been
so
conspicuously
dispensed
to
this
rising
republic
,
and
to
whom
we
are
bound
to
address
our
devout
gratitude
for
the
past
,
a
well
a
our
fervent
supplication
and
best
hope
for
the
future
.
