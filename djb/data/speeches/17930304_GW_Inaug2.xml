        <p>Fellow-Citizens:</p>
        <p>I am again called upon by the voice of my Country to execute the functions of its Chief
            Magistrate. When the occasion proper for it shall arrive, I shall endeavour to express
            the high sense I entertain of this distinguished honor, and of the confidence which has
            been reposed in me by the people of United America.</p>
        <p>Previous to the execution of any official act of the President, the Constitution requires
            an Oath of Office. This Oath I am now about to take, and in your presence, 56 that if it
            shall be found during my administration of the Government I have in any instance
            violated willingly, or knowingly, the injunction thereof, I may (besides incurring
            Constitutional punishmt) be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now witnesses of
            the present solemn Ceremony.</p>
    </body>
